1
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:22,655
The President will rise into the quiet.

2
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:37,605
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

3
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4
00:00:56,148 --> 00:01:00,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the opportunity to go out by this particular location the other day.

5
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's happening, Mr. President, is there's an old elm tree there.

6
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And the roots are pushing away the curbing.

7
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:14,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And the curb is actually sticking out onto the road itself.

8
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:22,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sidewalk, because of the trunk of the tree, is all broken up.

9
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:28,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that this be added to the list immediately and be done in the interest of public safety, Mr. President.

10
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,618
Thank you, Mr. President.

11
00:01:50,734 --> 00:02:01,402
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, of recent, there's been a lot of talk about this community reducing its carbon footprint and ways that we can offer initiatives to do so in the community.

12
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:08,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And one initiative, Mr. President, which is not a new initiative, is solar energy.

13
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:18,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been a big push of recent, again, to provide solar energy as an alternative method of

14
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, powering your home or your business.

15
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And I offer this tonight, Mr. President, because it was only back, I believe, in 2014 we dedicated the Alfred Pompeo DPW yard.

16
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:42,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember at the time that that building was built with the intent that it would accommodate solar panels.

17
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:48,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of the construction cost was to equip that building so it can accept solar panels.

18
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:56,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are, three years later, there has never been a solar panel installed at the DPW yard.

19
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:06,686
[SPEAKER_04]: The city, over the last several years, also, Mr. President, has offered at least two or three bid proposals that I'm aware of to install solar top

20
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:15,232
[SPEAKER_04]: panels at Meffitt High School, the Andrews and the McGlynn, as well as the Roberts, Brooks, and Columbus Elementary Schools.

21
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:24,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And to date, as far as I know, the proposals have gone nowhere to install solar panels on our schools, Mr. President.

22
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:31,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just so happened a constituent sent me, when they saw this on the agenda,

23
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:35,110
[SPEAKER_04]: sent me a copy of what the town of Lexington is doing.

24
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's pretty amazing what can be done if you put a little work into it and a little energy, Mr. President, no pun on that.

25
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:54,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Lexington just opened a 2.2 megawatt solar power farm, which will generate 30% of Lexington's municipal electricity demand.

26
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Combined with the school rooftop solar project that went online in 2014,

27
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:20,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Lexington will be generating 45% of its municipal electricity demand from solar, saving about $400,000 a year and providing $19 million in energy savings to the town and $8 million in health benefits over the expected life of the system.

28
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's well worth it, Mr. President, and many other communities

29
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:52,696
[SPEAKER_04]: are taking advantage of other green initiatives such as wind power, solar power, and I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that we also, if we do want to reduce our carbon footprint, and I believe the mayor entered into an agreement with a number of mayors around this area to have a zero carbon footprint by the year 2050, I believe is what I read in the paper.

30
00:04:53,448 --> 00:05:05,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will go a long way to not only reduce our carbon footprint, Mr. President, but it also sends a message to the community at large that, you know, we're just not going to preach this.

31
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to practice this.

32
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to do it in our municipal buildings.

33
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:10,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do it in our school buildings.

34
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:18,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to make sure that we're taking advantage of any possible savings that we can pass on to the taxpayer of this community.

35
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a sad commentary, Mr. President,

36
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:41,105
[SPEAKER_04]: when Stop and Shop in Wellington Circle is featured as the largest solar array with 240 kilowatt system, over 800 panels, as the largest solar use in this community.

37
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:46,547
[SPEAKER_04]: One little store is the largest use in this community.

38
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Grace Episcopal Church, back a few years ago, I believe it was in 2013,

39
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:59,471
[SPEAKER_04]: They signed a 10 year lease for panels and it's going to account for 75% of their electricity.

40
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So I applaud the Grace Episcopal Church for being proactive.

41
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:11,057
[SPEAKER_04]: and moving forward on ways that they can conserve and provide alternative power, Mr. President.

42
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:25,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So I offer this tonight as a way of possibly getting our Energy and Environment Office to start talking about some meaningful carbon footprint reductions that can be done from an administrative level.

43
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is one initiative that's worthy.

44
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being done in all surrounding communities now.

45
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:40,937
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hearing about the benefits of savings in those communities, which is directly tied to taxes and tax relief.

46
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:51,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that a roll call vote be taken that the city-equipped municipal and school buildings with solar, Mr. President.

47
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:53,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

48
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,040
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can, Mr. President, I thank my fellow council to bring this up.

49
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:24,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we can, if we can make amendment to that to add one program that some communities are using now, especially with the local communities taking over local ice rinks and the expenses that are incurred during the cost of electricity for the compressors and what's adjacent at our site, which is the field at Hormel Stadium,

50
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:38,048
[SPEAKER_03]: What some communities are doing are actually bringing in elevated solar farms where they're parking spots that are underneath the solar panels.

51
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:45,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that some communities are doing that are raising money to fund those particular sites.

52
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can, if you don't mind, if we can add, you know, public parks and recreational facilities that we can look into that, I think that, because if you look at

53
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:59,004
[SPEAKER_03]: the expense, especially at hockey rinks, and it's so well needed in our community.

54
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:13,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking to find a way to attract some sort of revenue or capture some sort of funding to help with that, alleviate some costs maybe to our youth hockey organizations and high school organizations.

55
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That looking at that type of program I think would be beneficial.

56
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can, thank you.

57
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

58
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everybody behind this rail at one point or another has supported green energy initiatives, solar power, so on and so forth.

59
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:30,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a great resolution.

60
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:30,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well thought out.

61
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:31,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well researched.

62
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I support it wholeheartedly and I move approval.

63
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Carviello.

64
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:42,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Vice President Marks for putting this on the agenda.

65
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great resolve and it's something that we should be striving to do as a city.

66
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I know so many homes have gone solar.

67
00:08:48,849 --> 00:09:05,932
[SPEAKER_08]: and more obviously in the works, and we do have a number of people in City Hall that work to raise awareness, whether it be at the winter, the energy festival day or any of the events that we have where we have tables, there's always somebody from

68
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:07,072
[SPEAKER_08]: how to

69
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:30,462
[SPEAKER_08]: how good it is for the environment on just a small one home level and what we could do if it was the citywide.

70
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's something that we should be moving forward with.

71
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:37,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there may be, I thought we did have a few at the schools.

72
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

73
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:43,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, I think there are, but I think, not in use.

74
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:46,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, I know that we may have some at the school.

75
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:51,436
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be in use and having the school system as well as the municipal buildings

76
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:56,680
[SPEAKER_08]: go solar would save, like you said, I think 45% in Lexington alone.

77
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can do the same, it's just definitely a step in the right direction.

78
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So I urge Ms.

79
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:11,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Hunt to give us an update, if we can amend this, just an update on if she's looked into this and any insight we could review before budget time.

80
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:21,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I believe that this should definitely be a topic of conversation when we meet with the Energy and Environment Office come a couple weeks when we talk budget, because it's something

81
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:27,136
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it be an investment or they work like they do with homes, something we should be doing.

82
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, and I second the resolve.

83
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

84
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:30,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

85
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:31,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:34,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank Councilor Mox for bringing this forward.

87
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:35,899
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great resolution.

88
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely am in favor of this resolution.

89
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should definitely be looking to make sure that all of our city buildings are equipped with this type of technology.

90
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:51,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also wanted to say that I am in support of this, and I thank you for bringing this forward.

91
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:53,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Marks.

92
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Two quick points I forgot to mention.

93
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:19,708
[SPEAKER_04]: When we installed the windmill behind the McGlynn School, you know, it was great to have, I think it captures maybe 15 or 20 percent of the electricity for that particular school, but it was also used as a teaching tool and still to date is used in classrooms as a teaching tool on the effect of

94
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:35,298
[SPEAKER_04]: green energy and so forth, and the way the mill runs and captures additional excess capacity, which could be sold off, sold to private or other type sectors.

95
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:42,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And this could be an additional also, Mr. President, using this solar energy.

96
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:54,632
[SPEAKER_04]: as a way of teaching our students in the school system on other ways of capturing energy and ways of providing for a greener environment, which I think we all strive for.

97
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just the financial component, which is great.

98
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want to save the taxpayer money.

99
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:08,402
[SPEAKER_04]: This has an educational component and potentially could be used to sell off energy

100
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,875
[SPEAKER_04]: to other people that need it, Mr. President.

101
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:12,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's a win-win for all.

102
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:13,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

103
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:23,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anyone noticed, Akati Foods on Commercial Street has done their whole building over with the Solo II, and he's invited us over there to take a tour anytime we want to go.

104
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,299
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Mox.

105
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

106
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew Kast and Eddie Cushon, Street Method Mass.

107
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Mox, for bringing up the windmill.

108
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,981
[SPEAKER_07]: It got me thinking.

109
00:12:37,988 --> 00:13:02,980
[SPEAKER_07]: A few years back, I was at the energy fair, I believe it's called, and I asked the new head person of the electrical department and some other person that works for the city if they could tell me how much energy it generated, dollar for dollar, what the cost would have been initially to build it if we had to pay for it out of our pocket, what the return is for the dollar.

110
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And they didn't have any answer whatsoever.

111
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:16,310
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, and I believe it's a great idea to use anything that's natural, wind, solar, et cetera.

112
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:24,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly this country put man on the moon 12 or 13 times and returned them safely.

113
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:29,676
[SPEAKER_07]: If that is true, I believe there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels.

114
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,718
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only probably one good reason and that is

115
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President Bush holding hands with the Arabs on his Texas ranch.

116
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Capitalism, I'm sure.

117
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:46,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes great sense, I just would like to know if it's cost effective.

118
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,849
[SPEAKER_07]: If you put up a dollar, do you get your dollar back?

119
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say, thank you.

120
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

121
00:13:55,891 --> 00:14:03,155
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern, a roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

122
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dela Russo?

123
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:05,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

124
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco?

125
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:06,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

126
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:07,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Night?

127
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

128
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:09,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lockhart?

129
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

130
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:10,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice-President Marks?

131
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

132
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

133
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

134
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice-President Caviello?

135
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

136
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:19,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

137
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:26,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Dela Russo to go under suspension, seconded by Councilor Night.

138
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,645
[SPEAKER_06]: We have something under suspension.

139
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:58,775
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-473 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas on Monday, 5-15-17, the MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board approved a $57 million spending plan for project and construction management of the Green Line Extension, and whereas the MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board further appropriated $8.7 million in funds for the purpose of

140
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:16,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Preparatory signal upgrading and other infrastructure work necessary for the completion of the Green Line extension be it resolved that the City of Med requests that the MADOT slash MBTA assign a community liaison to the city as a point of contact person

141
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,996
[SPEAKER_06]: to address community concerns and to share information.

142
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

143
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:22,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

144
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:29,718
[SPEAKER_09]: This week we got very exciting news that the Fiscal Control Board has moved and appropriated funds to bring the Greenland Extension to fruition.

145
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,360
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now we have a $57 million appropriation for project and construction management of the Greenland Extension.

146
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Included in part of that money, Mr. President, is $8.7 million to provide infrastructure repairs and signal preparation.

147
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:46,544
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of this work is going to be done on the corridor that runs parallel to Boston Ave.

148
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:54,249
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of this work is going to be done on property that abuts residential neighborhoods and residential properties, residential parcels, Mr. President.

149
00:15:54,702 --> 00:16:00,924
[SPEAKER_09]: As such, I think it's very important that we share the information from the MBTA with our community, when they're going to be in there, what type of work they're going to be doing.

150
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the best way to accomplish that, Mr. President, would be by assigning a city liaison that's responsible to address all questions and concerns related to the Green Line extension.

151
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:12,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

152
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:13,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.

153
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:17,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

154
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank my colleague for making this motion.

155
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,742
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing that's lacking.

156
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:25,264
[SPEAKER_10]: They've already begun construction in work.

157
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:26,765
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been clearing brush.

158
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,707
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been doing adjustments to the land back there.

159
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:42,177
[SPEAKER_10]: They have construction crews on site that are using warning horns in anticipation of the arrival of the trains coming rumbling through.

160
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:49,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So this has already been underway, there hasn't been a point person on behalf of the project management team.

161
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:54,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Projects receive some federal funding too, if I understand correctly, Councillor.

162
00:16:54,924 --> 00:17:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is a wonderful measure that will give people in the neighborhood a person that they can discuss their concerns with.

163
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:09,309
[SPEAKER_10]: A great many of the people that live in the neighborhood have been very active in this project, and they deserve the best.

164
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:12,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Mox.

165
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:13,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

166
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Council Knight for bringing this up.

167
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:18,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also ask if you wouldn't mind if we can amend the paper.

168
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we all received a correspondence from Tufts University.

169
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:33,988
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the process right now of revamping the pedestrian walkways at the corner of College Ave and Boston Ave, which is going to be quite an undertaking for a period of time.

170
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:46,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And any other construction that may be done by the T or the track area or any other preparation could increase the likelihood of stalled traffic and so forth and safety issues.

171
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:57,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask that, in conjunction with this paper, that also tufts the MBTA and the City of Method being constant correspondents regarding the work that's taking place.

172
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:05,826
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, Boston Ave has been increasingly under siege with all the construction of recent, Mr. President.

173
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

174
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,173
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can, again, I thank fellow council and I for bringing this forward.

175
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move forward, I too have been, as we move forward with the MBTA and issues and concerns.

176
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:33,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, I believe I got three out of the five business days, there were pitches again from High Street and Main with more construction work being done, moving the bus stop down 30 more feet.

177
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, buses being off the curb.

178
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:41,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hope to put a resolution for next week.

179
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but the concern is what we're asking for, and I appreciate the reason why I bring this up.

180
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: is as we're asking the MBTA in this great job that they're doing with this great, you know, this great initiative that there's still the basic concerns that we have still have to be met.

181
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:08,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, uh, uh, I will move forward next week to put a resolution in to, uh, eliminate that bus stop until the construction is done on that side.

182
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do, whether that it's not an amendment, but just an update.

183
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think how it's a knife for bringing that forward.

184
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:15,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

185
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Counsel Scott Pelly.

186
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:22,319
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor, Vice President Mox.

187
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:36,063
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're talking about the MBTA, if we can get a correspondence or a report back on the request by this council to move the bus stop that was in front of Bogginspot Liquors on a temporary basis.

188
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:38,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we've received a response yet.

189
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:42,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't gone out yet?

190
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,320
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

191
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:50,982
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could follow up, because the construction has started in the West Meffitt parking lot.

192
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:58,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that if we could just follow up with the T to see how long this process is going to take, it would be appreciated.

193
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President?

194
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor De La Rosa.

195
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:12,909
[SPEAKER_10]: In our packets this week, or on our tables tonight, I forget which one, we received a copy of the correspondence with the revised parking plan that the mayor's office has put out.

196
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:17,126
[SPEAKER_10]: that was distributed to the shopkeeps of the neighborhood.

197
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

198
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:22,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

199
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew, Cushing Street.

200
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:30,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilors, for jostling my memory with Tufts University and the Green Line.

201
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:42,370
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had it in my power, I would allow Tufts to have their Green Line extension and their

202
00:20:43,367 --> 00:21:00,175
[SPEAKER_07]: on one condition, that they take, let's say it's $1 billion even, out of their $7 billion endowment that they have in cash, and they don't pay any real estate tax, and they don't pay any corporation tax as a university.

203
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:10,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have them put up whatever it takes before their station is completed, before it's even started.

204
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:20,348
[SPEAKER_07]: to have an underground tunnel from Tufts University to right behind you, Council President Caviello.

205
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:26,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And where the red brick building is, I'd have the entrance to the Green Line.

206
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:37,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, Meffitt Square and the whole city would have the internal stimulus with a downtown subway, just like Malden and just like Winchester.

207
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:40,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

208
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:46,615
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

209
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:48,076
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

210
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:48,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

211
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

212
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

213
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

214
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:06,764
[SPEAKER_06]: offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the grass and the weeds at the corner of Mass Ave and South Boulder Road be cut.

215
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

216
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

217
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone's been on the council for a number of years, this is an annual request that goes out every year that the corner of

218
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:22,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Ave and South Porter Road, the grass and weeds be cut.

219
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:33,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And once again, I'm just requesting that it be added to the long laundry list of DPW tasks that this area be attended to immediately, Mr. President.

220
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:40,479
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

221
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,199
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

222
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

223
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that speeding on the lower end of Fulton Street be discussed.

224
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:50,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

225
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:58,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. President, this is one of the perennial issues that we try to deal with each and every year.

226
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:01,708
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottom of Fulton Street across from the ball field

227
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Continually is an area where speeding happens.

228
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:09,705
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been several recommendations.

229
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:16,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Council Longo offered one not too long ago to put the electronic speed sign on that particular street.

230
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've offered it on several times, Mr. President.

231
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:23,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I'm getting calls from area residents that are afraid to go outside.

232
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how fast the cars are coming down from the hill to that lower part of Fulton Street.

233
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're very concerned, Mr. President.

234
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:40,941
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just a major accident in the town of Sandwich, where two senior citizens were struck and killed, Mr. President, walking in a crosswalk.

235
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:47,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I bring these issues up, Mr. President, it's not just to vent or to make hard ear.

236
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:51,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to actually get results when it comes to pedestrian safety in this community.

237
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:58,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'm tired of talking about unpainted crosswalks, about speeding on our streets, Mr. President.

238
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:07,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, several months back, we voted unanimously to lower the speed limit from 30 to 25 on all non-posted roads.

239
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:11,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen one sign erected yet, Mr. President.

240
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:22,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Not one sign alerting residents of this community, you know what, there's a change in our ordinances that only allow you to drive 25 on non-posted roads.

241
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:24,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge change in the community.

242
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:34,652
[SPEAKER_04]: When surrounding communities did it, they posted it through electronic billboards, they sent out messages, they, you know, they did a great job getting it out to the community.

243
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard anything in this community.

244
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:37,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing at all.

245
00:24:38,194 --> 00:25:00,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask, Mr. President, in addition to what was just mentioned, that the reduction in speed on all non-posted roads to 25 be promoted in this city through either reverse 911, which I get three calls a night, or through other means, maybe the electronic billboard posted strategically and entranceways to our community.

246
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have to get the message out, Mr. President,

247
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:11,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have to start erecting these signs that take down the old 30 mile an hour and put up to 25 mile an hour in the interest of public safety.

248
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

249
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:15,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

250
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:21,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'd also like to amend the paper and request that the Traffic Division of the Medford Police Department establish a directed patrol.

251
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,622
[SPEAKER_09]: at the foot of Fulton Street by Gillis Park during the hours where permanent events are taking place.

252
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:33,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, we're seeing Little League taking place at Gillis Park and some Little League softball, high school baseball, and so forth taking place at Higgy Park.

253
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:39,848
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an area that's certainly well-traveled by pedestrians that are going between the two facilities, two locations.

254
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:46,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Parking's tight down there, as we know, and it requires some parking further away and requires people to walk.

255
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:47,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that

256
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: The Traffic Division of the Atlanta Police Department established a directed patrol down there, with particular focus made during hours that those two parks, Hickey and Gillis, are permitted, Mr. President.

257
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:58,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Member O'Kurin.

258
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Carviello.

259
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the resolve.

260
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have another one on with regards to speeding.

261
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:12,942
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems maybe it's the summertime, springtime, and people are really noticing the speeding in our community.

262
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:15,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten a number of complaints.

263
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:23,736
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could ask for an update as an amendment with regards to the, we appropriated money for a speed monitoring sign.

264
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,157
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one, it was broken and we did appropriate, this has been months now.

265
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:38,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can get an update, I believe they may have even more purchasing too, putting an update with regards to the status of the speed monitoring signs as well as the radar guns, the new radar guns.

266
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:44,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get an update on South Street that traffic division of the police department has been out recently, so

267
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:50,548
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to make sure we get those speed signs up and running too, because it's another effective way.

268
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:59,600
[SPEAKER_08]: The one on Elm, I see it every day deterring people from, once they see 39, 40, I see people slowing down and it works.

269
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:03,084
[SPEAKER_08]: It works, so if we can just get an update on that, that'd be great.

270
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:03,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

271
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:15,348
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Knight, and amended by Councilor Longo Kern, seconded by Councilor Falco.

272
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:16,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

273
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:16,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

274
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

275
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:30,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the potholes in front of 55 Hutchins Road be repaired in the interest of public safety.

276
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:31,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks.

277
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:40,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. President, there was some recent road work done on Hutchins Road, and they beautifully paved a portion of the street.

278
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:46,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And right where that portion stops, there's several giant potholes.

279
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:50,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they went another three feet, we would have covered all these potholes.

280
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, they only go to whatever the parameters are.

281
00:27:54,438 --> 00:28:00,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the interest of public safety, Mr. President, those potholes have to be repaired immediately in front of 55 Hutchins Road.

282
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,777
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, Councilor Longo-Kern.

283
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:07,659
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're on potholes, thank you, President Caviello.

284
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:16,283
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottom of Rita, where it hits Highland Ave, there's another extremely large pothole I got a call on, if we could get that filled in the interest of public safety as well.

285
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:16,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

286
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:24,707
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Longo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Falco.

287
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:25,368
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

288
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:25,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

289
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:27,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

290
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:29,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Vice President Mox.

291
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:37,666
[SPEAKER_06]: be it resolved that the broken curb at 123 Placet Road be replaced in the interest of public safety.

292
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:38,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks.

293
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

294
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:46,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, there was road work done recently, utility road work on Placet Road across from Placet Park.

295
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:49,033
[SPEAKER_04]: The utility work is done.

296
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They left the site a complete mess.

297
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:56,157
[SPEAKER_04]: The trucks that were there from the utility company rode over the curbing.

298
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:59,759
[SPEAKER_04]: and broke the curbing in front of the homeowner's home, Mr. President.

299
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:21,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, someone from a building department or from the city needs to go out there and find out what's happening, why the site was left in such terrible condition, and why municipal property, which was damaged, has not been brought to the attention of the utility company, which pulls a bond

300
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:28,936
[SPEAKER_04]: and requires them, Mr. President, I believe it's a million-dollar or so bond, requires them, if any damage is done, to replace the damage.

301
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:41,386
[SPEAKER_04]: The only way the damage is going to be replaced is if the city, as a clerk of the work, that calls these utility companies, as Councilor Scott Pelley has mentioned ad nauseam, calls these utility companies on the carpet.

302
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:43,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not happening, Mr. President.

303
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,230
[SPEAKER_04]: They're leaving job sites a filthy mess.

304
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a disgrace, Mr. President.

305
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:50,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be happening on our streets.

306
00:29:50,964 --> 00:30:03,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that that curb be repaired immediately and that someone from the building department go out there and address the issue of the broken curb, Mr. President.

307
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:04,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

308
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

309
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:11,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I would once again request that the Engineering Department respond to Council Resolution 16-404.

310
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:20,643
[SPEAKER_09]: This resolution requested a breakdown of all streets that were opened by public utilities from January 1st, 2014 to date.

311
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been 18 months.

312
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:23,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We have not received this.

313
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:32,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Councilor Marks puts a resolution on about 123 Place that Road and public utilities being out there, and it leads me to question as to whether or not our Engineering Department knows

314
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:38,532
[SPEAKER_09]: when public utilities are going out and tearing up our streets because, quite frankly, I don't think it takes 18 months to get a response for anything.

315
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:42,193
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I wholeheartedly support the resolution and I second the proposal.

316
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

317
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:49,315
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

318
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:49,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

319
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

320
00:30:53,196 --> 00:31:01,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Falco be it resolved that the grass be cut on the corner of Fountain Street and Webster Street.

321
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

322
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:04,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this year is, uh, like the previous, uh, uh, issue regarding, uh, grass trimming.

324
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's been a yearly request.

325
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I drove by, um, the corner of fountain and, um,

326
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:20,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Webster tonight on the way to the meeting, the grass has got to be at least two to three feet tall.

327
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can lose a dog in there.

328
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:23,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's really bad.

329
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be addressed immediately.

330
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,141
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also public safety concern.

331
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:35,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone coming out of a fountain street, taking a left onto Webster, uh, you know, you really can't see the oncoming traffic.

332
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really needs to be addressed.

333
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:38,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hopefully sooner than later.

334
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe actually this is a DCR property.

335
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the DCR needs to be contacted.

336
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could have that done,

337
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,350
[SPEAKER_01]: would be greatly appreciated.

338
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:46,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

339
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, if you could contact the DCR for that, we'd appreciate it.

340
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:51,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

341
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:57,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'd just like to amend the paper to request the DCR also provide us with the maintenance schedule for the area that's in question.

342
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:58,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

343
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended by Councilor Knight.

344
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:07,554
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

345
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:08,294
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

346
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:08,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

347
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

348
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:22,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Council Member Kern, be it resolved that the speeding and heavy trucking on South Street and Harvard Street be deterred and discussed in the interest of public safety.

349
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Member Kern.

350
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Carviello.

351
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:30,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got some complaints about the speeding and the heavy trucking on those two streets.

352
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:34,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiple people on South have complained recently.

353
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:38,207
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mack trucks are coming down South, there are manhole

354
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:42,820
[SPEAKER_08]: covers that are sinking a little bit, so it hits the manhole and houses are shaking.

355
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all got an email today from another woman that has been complaining for several months.

356
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about this.

357
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:57,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe this is the third time just from her and her neighbors complaining that it's come up on the council floor.

358
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And the speeding and the heavy trucking, we need to do something to deter it.

359
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we've all spoken about it.

360
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:05,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We've mentioned

361
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:11,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Striping, we've mentioned raised crosswalks, and I'm sure it'll be mentioned again tonight.

362
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:22,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, I know there's no necessarily four-way intersection there, but it was asked if we could do stop signs, one or two, maybe at Curtis, maybe at Walnut.

363
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:31,612
[SPEAKER_08]: You have hundreds of people walking from Medford Square down South Street Court down into Walnut Street, hundreds of people crossing every day.

364
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:36,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So we could possibly put a stop sign just to slow people down.

365
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:43,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that that is maybe is the easier resolve than raised crosswalks because it falls on deaf ears.

366
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:54,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have the raised crosswalk on Winthrop and then you come down and take the turn onto South and right after the raised crosswalk you get in complaints that people are picking up the speed.

367
00:33:55,013 --> 00:34:01,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It works to deter it in that part of Winthrop, and then people picking up speed, taking the turn, and flying down South Street.

368
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:08,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Now when you have these Mack trucks doing it at night, it almost sounds like the airplane noise that everybody else in the city is suffering from.

369
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:16,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's disturbing, it's a public safety concern, and it's really messing with people's quiet enjoyment of their homes.

370
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:23,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's come to a point where something needs to be done, and I'm not even sure if we've got a response on this.

371
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:31,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know that the traffic division was out over the last few days doing some ticketing and monitoring, and I'm very thankful for that.

372
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,426
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need the speed monitor sign there for several weeks to just let people know what the speed limit is and how fast they're going.

373
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:49,172
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, whether it be speed bumps or I'm proposing a couple stop signs on South Street, I think that would help.

374
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:52,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also know Harvard Street is suffering from the same thing.

375
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you have the truck routes that are coming down Harvard or South.

376
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just not a good place to, obviously, have your windows open on a summer night and when you're here and speeding.

377
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:08,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it's definitely a public safety concern if you're trying to cross the street.

378
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:19,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would propose that this be on the Traffic Commission's June agenda, if we could make that a part of the resolution, that stop signs on South Street be part of the Traffic Commission's

379
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,091
[SPEAKER_08]: agenda come June, and we'd be notified of that.

380
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:28,673
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be helpful, because that's something I would like to plan on attending.

381
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of people on South would, too.

382
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:32,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

383
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:36,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also just want to make sure that we're, you know, I know Traffic Division's been on South.

384
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:40,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure they're also on Harvard, so that we can try to deter it.

385
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:42,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And trucks are going to drive down there.

386
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we did make Harvard no trucking, but then the signs were taken down per the state.

387
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:52,379
[SPEAKER_08]: we need to make sure they're at least following the speed limit and do something for our residents.

388
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I appreciate my council support.

389
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote.

390
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:56,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

391
00:35:57,063 --> 00:35:57,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor knife.

392
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:08,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the resolution and request that the traffic commission examine the feasibility of banning heavy, heavy trucking on South street as amended by counselor night.

393
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:08,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

394
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:10,412
[SPEAKER_09]: No second.

395
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:11,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dela Russo.

396
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:13,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:13,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh,

398
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:28,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I, uh, further like to, I'd like to amend this paper further that the, uh, uh, commissioner of public works update the council, uh, regarding the implementation of additional raised crosswalks.

399
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:42,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the only one I believe that we have in the city, um, uh, on Winthrop street, um, seems to some to do something, but it's, uh, in the three years that it's in place,

400
00:36:43,196 --> 00:37:02,406
[SPEAKER_10]: In the three years we've been awaiting the other two experimental raised crosswalks, which have yet to arrive, the one existing one has now squished itself out, so to speak, and is just a mere cause for deacceleration as one

401
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:15,041
[SPEAKER_10]: achieves rocket speed coming down Winthrop Street so that they can make lights and swerve their way to the South Street Bridge and the Mystic Valley Parkway.

402
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:23,051
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd appreciate an update on what the plans are of the administration.

403
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:42,644
[SPEAKER_10]: for implementation of these additional crosswalks which do serve an effect for public safety and to deter speeding where they're maintained, painted and implemented in a pattern that serves the needs of the citizens.

404
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,046
[SPEAKER_10]: The Councillor also pointed out

405
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:50,353
[SPEAKER_10]: the truckings sounds are like airplanes.

406
00:37:51,014 --> 00:38:14,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I agree with that, but I will point out that today, as I observed, the landing pattern of some of the airplanes coming down over the Wellington area, they were so low that if you were to stand on the roof of one of the ninth street condo buildings, I'm sure you could have touched the wheels of the planes as they were being deployed.

407
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:16,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

408
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:17,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

409
00:38:18,794 --> 00:38:19,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

410
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:21,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank my council colleague for bringing this up.

411
00:38:22,396 --> 00:38:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if I'm, if I recall right, I think it was a year and a half ago, this council was told that there was a traffic engineering study being done at the corner of Winthrop and Salt Street to improve pedestrian safety.

412
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:39,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that is a terrible, terrible intersection, uh, with cars coming,

413
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:45,641
[SPEAKER_04]: down Winthrop trying to take a left onto South or coming down the other side of Winthrop trying to take a right onto South.

414
00:38:47,102 --> 00:39:00,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can get an update on that traffic engineering study, the way it sounded, the money was there, the study was done, and I think people are waiting to see, you know,

415
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:03,955
[SPEAKER_04]: results, and we have yet to see any.

416
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:16,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, several years back, Mr. President, and you know, it didn't meet much fanfare, but I offered several resolutions to create a trucking team within the City of Meffitt Police Department.

417
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And other communities have them, Mr. President.

418
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the state police does a fair amount of trucking violations within our community.

419
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:29,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We have major trucking routes that run throughout our city.

420
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:36,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And our police department, to be quite frank with you, their hands are tied when it comes to these 18-wheelers.

421
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:41,681
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, we don't have the equipment to do the testing of capacity.

422
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the equipment that weighs vehicles.

423
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:56,953
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a trucking team that's equipped to pull these 18-wheelers over and are trained to look at the logs that the drivers are supposed to keep by state and federal law.

424
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:05,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we fall short of the mark protecting not only our city roads, but our residents, Mr. President, from these 18-wheelers.

425
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:10,063
[SPEAKER_04]: that are traversing down quite residential areas.

426
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:28,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I keep referring to Scintilli Circle because I live in the Wellington area, but we all remember what took place back some years ago when there was an oil truck that tipped over in Scintilli Circle and lit part of the senior housing on fire because, Mr. President, the driver was speeding.

427
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:32,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it would go a long way and pay for itself.

428
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:36,202
[SPEAKER_04]: When you pull an 18-wheeler over, it's not a $50 or $100 ticket.

429
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:45,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's upward from what I'm being told, $1,500 to $2,000 when they start going through the potential violations for these 18-wheelers.

430
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:51,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would recommend, Mr. President, that the administration once again look into the creation

431
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:59,756
[SPEAKER_04]: of a trucking team within the police department to serve as the eyes and ears on our roads, Mr. President.

432
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: In particular, when you have other communities that are diverting these trucks off their roads, we seem to be getting the brunt of it in this community.

433
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think after time, you know, the truckers all talk.

434
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they say, gee, where's the best lease resistance that we can go and not worry?

435
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:24,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guarantee you, the city of Meffitt's a good route to take, Mr. President, because we're ill-equipped to be pulling these trucks over.

436
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:32,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we can depend on state police to do all our policing in the community when it comes to these heavy trucks, Mr. President.

437
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank Council Member Longo Kern for bringing this up.

438
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:41,970
[SPEAKER_04]: and hope that Chief Sacco and the administration, you know, train some officers and create a trucking team, Mr. President.

439
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Knife.

440
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:44,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

441
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:45,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great idea.

442
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the interim, however, we do not going to have a trucking team.

443
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:58,461
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to further amend the resolution requesting that the state police established directed patrols at South Street and at Harvard Street for the purpose of monitoring trucking with their truck division.

444
00:41:59,422 --> 00:41:59,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

445
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:11,154
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councillor Alango-Kern, as amended by Councillor Naith, Councillor DelaRusso and Councillor Marks, seconded by Councillor Falco.

446
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:12,195
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favour?

447
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:13,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:15,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record.

449
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

450
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

451
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:34,879
[SPEAKER_02]: This matter about the trucking has come up at the Method Police community meetings, and even if they had all of the equipment, they can't do it because of the traffic that would back up behind those trucks.

452
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the detective's name.

453
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I directly asked him to do this.

454
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:53,366
[SPEAKER_02]: from seeing the way 18 wheelers turn right here out at the point at the, at the citizens bank out at century bank, uh, they physically can't do it even if they had had the equipment.

455
00:42:53,926 --> 00:43:02,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I would support, uh, what councilor Knight offered, which is have the state police do it outside the city limits.

456
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:06,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So as not to congest the city, they do it on route 16.

457
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:08,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently they do it.

458
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:11,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought this up at the community police meetings.

459
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:16,717
[SPEAKER_02]: They said right out to me, they physically can't do it because of the traffic nightmare that would happen.

460
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:22,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Those truck pullovers, they take a long, long time to do.

461
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just giving you the information I got directly from the Method Police.

462
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, too, on the matter, if I could.

463
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:34,906
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the information, Vice President Fox.

464
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate Mr. Cappucci bringing that up.

465
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it sends a bad message.

466
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:40,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't hear it from the police department.

467
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:50,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact that they're not willing to pull trucks over because it may create a concern with traffic congestion, to me, is a ridiculous statement.

468
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're trying to pull trucks over that may be in violation of traffic particular citations.

469
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And to say we don't have space to pull them over is, I see them pulled over on the Felsway.

470
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:07,212
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to talk about a busy road, there's ways of doing it, Mr. President.

471
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep traffic without impeding traffic and also providing public safety.

472
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:15,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that's not the reason why we're not doing it in this community Mr. President.

473
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:16,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. Vice President.

474
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:19,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they're not willing.

475
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we're a current force of only 104 officers and not having the necessary capacity to do these things.

476
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely willing.

477
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely want to do it.

478
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:37,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But they looked at it, Councillor, and it's physically not possible for them.

479
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do it.

480
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:42,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they want to do it and provide public safety at the same time.

481
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I didn't give them this information.

482
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:52,488
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect to the gentleman behind the rail, I think that it would be best if we heard what they do and don't want to do from the police department, not the individual.

483
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:54,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that he does attend the meetings.

484
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:57,509
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we are sending a resolution forward and we're asking for certain information.

485
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:00,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We want that information to come back from the police department and I don't want to deter from that.

486
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:01,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

487
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

488
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.

489
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:10,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk directly to the police and I'm sure they're going to confirm exactly what, what I just said.

490
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:17,796
[SPEAKER_02]: On the matter of what Councillor De La Russo brought up about the low-flying planes and the noise, I read an article.

491
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of you saw it.

492
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:20,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted it around Facebook.

493
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:25,680
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a problem in Los Angeles out of LAX.

494
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a health problem.

495
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,542
[SPEAKER_02]: These low-flying planes are producing

496
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:39,300
[SPEAKER_02]: something called ultrafine particles that are hurting respiratory systems of people that are going to the hospital.

497
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:51,686
[SPEAKER_02]: These low-flying planes, I mean, I know the city council, it's up to our state and our federal delegation to do something, but maybe the city council as a body can look into this article.

498
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I can send it to you and see what their findings were.

499
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:56,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in communities 10 miles around

500
00:45:57,228 --> 00:46:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: LAX, we're what, seven, eight miles away from Logan, and we are, from that presentation given by Massport a few weeks ago, we are ground zero.

501
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:11,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is directly being assaulted by these things.

502
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the noise is definitely a problem.

503
00:46:13,952 --> 00:46:20,833
[SPEAKER_02]: But I went to the hospital a couple weeks ago because I had upper respiratory problems.

504
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:22,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some medication.

505
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,114
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one person waiting.

506
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:29,379
[SPEAKER_02]: in the urgent care waiting room and two people on either side of me with the same problem.

507
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Another person had it that I'm currently seeing now.

508
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:45,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should probably look into, you know, medical records going on and determine if these ultrafine particles are

509
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:51,266
[SPEAKER_02]: invading our airspace and falling on our schools and everything else.

510
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:56,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The noise could be a small problem compared to something that could be much larger.

511
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

512
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:02,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member O'Kane.

513
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:05,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Cappucci, if you don't mind sending us that article.

514
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:11,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we spoke about this a couple weeks ago and I did bring it up and asked Alicia Hunt, our environmental

515
00:47:12,017 --> 00:47:30,774
[SPEAKER_08]: agent we probably should ask even the health department to if they've done any research if they know of anything like this and Obviously try to move forward to get them to fly higher I guess that's might be our only option from that presentation, but something definitely needs to be done with the noise and Obviously this issue.

516
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:32,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very disturbing.

517
00:47:32,576 --> 00:47:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make sure to send that to you.

518
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:34,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

519
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:34,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you

520
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:39,398
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern, name and address for the record.

521
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:41,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

522
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:44,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real quick, if you're gonna be testing for debris.

523
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're not talking about airplanes, we're talking about traffic.

524
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you wanna bring that up, you wanna come back with that after?

525
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:52,363
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't.

526
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just responding to the comment.

527
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just responding to the comment, it'll be 30 seconds or less.

528
00:47:57,445 --> 00:48:04,407
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have Alicia Hunt contact me, the back of my house is covered in black soot from plane debris, and if they wanna test that and find out what it is,

529
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,045
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

530
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:06,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

531
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:09,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

532
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:24,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, briefly, I just wanted to, uh, say, I'm not sure if the local police on this 18 wheeler business can, can, uh, enforce outside of speeding tickets and things of that nature.

533
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, police maybe even had trouble 10 years ago to enforce to our pocket.

534
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:34,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we inherited Republic Park and I presume, um,

535
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:44,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it's, I'm just thinking out loud, maybe that would be a problem in a job for the state police.

536
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:45,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

537
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, Councilor Longo-Kern.

538
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:52,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, I almost said thank you.

539
00:48:52,648 --> 00:49:01,394
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kern, amended by Councilor Naith, Councilor Dela Russo, and Councilor Mox, and seconded by Councilor Falco.

540
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:02,715
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

541
00:49:02,735 --> 00:49:02,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

542
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:04,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

543
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:18,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Knight and President Caravello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish Judy Granara a very happy 75th birthday.

544
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:18,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

545
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Judy's been a fixture in the community for a number of times, along with her husband John.

546
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:27,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to take an opportunity to wish her a very happy and momentous 75th birthday.

547
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:30,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope my council colleagues will join me in wishing her the same.

548
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:30,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

549
00:49:31,984 --> 00:49:33,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And happy birthday to Judy.

550
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:35,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Knight.

551
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

552
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

553
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:40,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

554
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:53,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by President Caravello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere and deepest condolences to the family of Grace Colonna who passed away this week at the age of 100 years old.

555
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:57,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Her presence in our community will be missed.

556
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:01,268
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could stand for a moment of silence for Grace Colonna it would be appreciated.

557
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:17,040
[SPEAKER_06]: petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

558
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:32,335
[SPEAKER_06]: 17469, petition from Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, Mass., to speak to the council on the Medford Citywide yard sale on June 10th for the friends of Felsmere Heights who will receive registration fees.

559
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:34,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

560
00:50:35,006 --> 00:50:41,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez from 281 Park Street, and I'm just here to promote the Medford Citywide Yard Sale.

561
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:46,812
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great eco-friendly fundraiser that will have no negative effects on the city.

562
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:49,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the idea from running the Roberts Elementary Yard Sale.

563
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:54,275
[SPEAKER_00]: We've run four of them, and each time we've raised $1,000 for enrichment in the schools.

564
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:57,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that citywide would be great.

565
00:50:57,477 --> 00:51:01,418
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay for trash, so why throw things out that are still good that others can use?

566
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plan is on June 10th,

567
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,524
[SPEAKER_00]: People will register ahead of time for $25, and your address will appear on a citywide map.

568
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,887
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a yard, then you can sell at the Condon Shell.

569
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,128
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have tables set up there.

570
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:15,329
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the shell reserved.

571
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will shop around to all the different yard sales.

572
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:24,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be great, because the money will go towards the Friends of Felsmere Heights.

573
00:51:25,037 --> 00:51:27,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that doesn't know what the Friends of Felsmere Heights is,

574
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:36,572
[SPEAKER_00]: They approached me after they found me involved with the 61 Locust Street development and the working to right-size the Breakpro project.

575
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:42,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So we share a common goal of stopping overdevelopment that they think will be detrimental to the quality of life.

576
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:51,835
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to work with Medford and Malden officials to purchase the Malden Hospital property and return the majority of the land to Parkland with an appropriate size development.

577
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:58,577
[SPEAKER_00]: The purchase would be made with a combination of CPA funds, grants, as well as donations and fundraisers such as this.

578
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:05,921
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project, if that project went through, it would have a seriously negative effect on the Fulton Heights area.

579
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:13,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very relevant to Medford residents to try to move this project forward and stop that area from being overdeveloped.

580
00:52:13,827 --> 00:52:21,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Because several hundred more cars coming down Fulton Spring and Fulton Street would be very detrimental to the quality of life of Medford residents.

581
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:30,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So this group has also generously agreed to split their proceeds with the abutters for the 61 Locust Street or Old Shaw's project.

582
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:38,238
[SPEAKER_00]: As residents and myself, I feel it's important to come out and support them in their fight for their neighborhood as well as the rest of our city.

583
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:43,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once there's overdevelopment, overcrowding in our schools, it's going to be too late to turn that back.

584
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:46,245
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be proactive and work hard for that now.

585
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:55,108
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that many of you will join me in registering for this yard sale on June 10th to support our neighborhoods and protect them from overdevelopment.

586
00:52:55,988 --> 00:52:59,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Facebook page, the Medford Citywide Yard Sale Facebook page.

587
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:04,331
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an email address, MedfordCityYardSale at gmail.com.

588
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:09,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yard sale will be on June 10th from 9 to 2 and I hope to see many of you there.

589
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:10,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

590
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:13,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

591
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:19,309
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caviello, how will people know which homes are involved besides the Facebook page?

592
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:23,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there going to be like a reverse 9-1-1, or how else can we find out?

593
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe there'll be a reverse 9-1-1.

594
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:32,072
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to advertise the event on the billboard, so it'll have our Facebook information so that people can go there for maps.

595
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,513
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be maps available on that day.

596
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:39,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that there will be some available a little earlier than that, perhaps at the city hall or the library.

597
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really should people like maybe start at the condon shell and there'll be maps there.

598
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they want to go to different homes.

599
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:45,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

600
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:47,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

601
00:53:47,463 --> 00:53:47,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job.

602
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:48,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

603
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:51,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

604
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by council night to receive in place in five.

605
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

606
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:57,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

607
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:58,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Rickets.

608
00:53:59,511 --> 00:54:00,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Mr. Rick.

609
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have an announcement, Mr. President, if I could, that's beneficial to seniors.

610
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:19,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year there's called the vegetable $5 registration, and this allows seniors to register for fresh vegetables and produce.

611
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:21,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to let

612
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:26,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Our seniors know that it's $5 a bag for seniors living in Meffitt.

613
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:37,485
[SPEAKER_04]: This weekly pickup program on Tuesday afternoons from July through October, you must register in advance and registration will take place

614
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:45,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday, June 13th, 2.30 to 3.30 at Edgeley Hall in the Saltonstall Building, 121 Riverside Ave.

615
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tuesday, June 20th, 10.30, 11.30 at the Senior Center on 101 Riverside Ave.

616
00:54:53,855 --> 00:55:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to thank the Medford Farmers Market, Hallmark Health, and Mass in Motion for their support of this.

617
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a great way of our seniors, Mr. President,

618
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:11,864
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, homegrown and reasonably priced, uh, vegetables.

619
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I think it's a great idea, Mr. President.

620
00:55:14,886 --> 00:55:15,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

621
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:17,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRusso.

622
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:23,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, the table records of the meeting of May 9th, 2017 were passed to me for inspection.

623
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:30,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize for my absence due to illness at the end of the meeting, uh, due to my allergies.

624
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:34,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've reviewed those records and moved their approval, Mr. President.

625
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:34,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

626
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:36,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Council accepts your apology.

627
00:55:36,908 --> 00:55:38,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Speak for yourself.

628
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:40,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caravaglia.

629
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to ask if we've heard anything from the administration with regards to budget hearings or when we would expect to get the budget book or pieces thereof.

630
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:56,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I have asked several times and they are working on them and that was the answer I have.

631
00:55:56,893 --> 00:55:57,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

632
00:55:57,113 --> 00:56:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with, so did they give you any insight with regards to when we could start our budget?

633
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:11,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I asked, I said, if we have some of the departments, if we could get started on them, they would like to wait until they're fully complete and do it all at once.

634
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:15,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it all at once, so what is our plan?

635
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to do a full Saturday?

636
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:18,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to do several nights?

637
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:24,109
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as we get them, I have asked several times for them, and they're working on them, and hopefully we'll have them shortly.

638
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can maybe, through the chair, ask as a body.

639
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Burke, if you could make a request.

640
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:38,936
[SPEAKER_06]: To the mayor When the budget will be ready So that we could maybe have it for a week before we start meeting.

641
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:51,666
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be I would like they have made I've made multiple requests as I know we all want to Study them before we do it so we don't have problems that we have in the past Council tonight Mr. President, thank you very much.

642
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:56,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to take an opportunity to thank all the individuals that were able to come out and support

643
00:56:57,532 --> 00:57:04,476
[SPEAKER_09]: this weekend's Memorial Day ceremonies by going down to the Oak Grove Cemetery and decorating the graves of our fallen veterans, Mr. President.

644
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:10,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year, the Post-45 American Legion puts together a contingency of volunteers.

645
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:13,200
[SPEAKER_09]: A number of them come from the Medford Elks, the St.

646
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:23,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Clement's School, the Boys and Girls Scouts, and a number of other organizations across the city of Medford to come and show their support for the veterans and support for the Memorial Day celebration, Mr. President.

647
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:26,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity of going out Saturday morning with my son and my father.

648
00:57:26,945 --> 00:57:30,789
[SPEAKER_09]: out onto Aspen lawn and we decorated a number of graves with some members of the Medford Elks.

649
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:36,990
[SPEAKER_09]: These service organizations do a great job making Medford the great community that we live in and that we get to enjoy.

650
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:42,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to take an opportunity to thank them all for their help and hard work in preparing for this weekend's Memorial Day Ceremonies.

651
00:57:42,372 --> 00:57:42,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

652
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:50,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I can remind everybody for tomorrow, the Veterans Lunch sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce will be here tomorrow at noontime.

653
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:52,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free to all veterans in the community.

654
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:57,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyone who can come out who hasn't been here in the past, it's a nice turnout.

655
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I would request that your presence be here.

656
00:58:02,418 --> 00:58:06,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget Monday at the cemetery, the Memorial Day celebration.

657
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Barry will call you and let you know.

658
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:10,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But just a reminder of that.

659
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mox.

660
00:58:12,604 --> 00:58:23,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I would respectfully ask that we dedicate this meeting to the victims of the concert terror attack that took place yesterday in England, Mr. President, and that we also have a moment of silence.

661
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could rise for a moment of silence.

662
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:38,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member Kern.

663
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Carviel.

664
00:58:39,447 --> 00:58:58,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I could just remind the Council and see if we've made any progress with regards to maybe meeting with the Department of Public Works Director, who's very responsive to our individual requests, but maybe to talk to him about citywide pothole, sunken manhole covers within our city.

665
00:58:59,517 --> 00:59:02,639
[SPEAKER_08]: That, along with the speeding, has been kind of overwhelming, and I

666
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,743
[SPEAKER_08]: can't keep up with emailing or texting him special requests.

667
00:59:07,783 --> 00:59:11,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we did discuss it to meet with him and see what we can do.

668
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:13,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need more fill?

669
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:15,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to hire an outside contractor?

670
00:59:15,729 --> 00:59:18,250
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we proceeding?

671
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:24,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going just by complaints or are we going street by street like we probably should be?

672
00:59:25,955 --> 00:59:34,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the two papers that got referred to the subcommittee were one to create a sign ordinance relative to street sweeping, and the other one would be a 30 day requirement to remove stumps.

673
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:37,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the two papers I believe that were referred to the subcommittee.

674
