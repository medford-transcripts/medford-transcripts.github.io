    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=55.088s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=56.148s">I</a>  had the opportunity to go out by this particular location the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=60.73s">And</a>  what's happening, Mr. President, is there's an old elm tree there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=65.436s">And</a>  the roots are pushing away the curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=68.839s">And</a>  the curb is actually sticking out onto the road itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=74.845s">And</a>  the sidewalk, because of the trunk of the tree, is all broken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=82.471s">So</a>  I would ask that this be added to the list immediately and be done in the interest of public safety, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=110.734s">You</a>  know, of recent, there's been a lot of talk about this community reducing its carbon footprint and ways that we can offer initiatives to do so in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=122.203s">And</a>  one initiative, Mr. President, which is not a new initiative, is solar energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=128.908s">And</a>  there's been a big push of recent, again, to provide solar energy as an alternative method of <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=138.916s">you</a>  know, powering your home or your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=143.479s">And</a>  I offer this tonight, Mr. President, because it was only back, I believe, in 2014 we dedicated the Alfred Pompeo DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=154.547s">And</a>  I remember at the time that that building was built with the intent that it would accommodate solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=163.012s">And</a>  part of the construction cost was to equip that building so it can accept solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=169.316s">And</a>  here we are, three years later, there has never been a solar panel installed at the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=176.94s">The</a>  city, over the last several years, also, Mr. President, has offered at least two or three bid proposals that I'm aware of to install solar top <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=187.326s">panels</a>  at Medford High School, the Andrews and the McGlynn, as well as the Roberts, Brooks, and Columbus Elementary Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=196.112s">And</a>  to date, as far as I know, the proposals have gone nowhere to install solar panels on our schools, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=205.059s">And</a>  it just so happened a constituent sent me, when they saw this on the agenda, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=211.707s">sent</a>  me a copy of what the town of Lexington is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=215.87s">And</a>  it's pretty amazing what can be done if you put a little work into it and a little energy, Mr. President, no pun on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=225.357s">Lexington</a>  just opened a 2.2 megawatt solar power farm, which will generate 30% of Lexington's municipal electricity demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=235.665s">Combined</a>  with the school rooftop solar project that went online in 2014, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=240.988s">Lexington</a>  will be generating 45% of its municipal electricity demand from solar, saving about $400,000 a year and providing $19 million in energy savings to the town and $8 million in health benefits over the expected life of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=261.635s">So,</a>  you know, it's well worth it, Mr. President, and many other communities <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=266.145s">are</a>  taking advantage of other green initiatives such as wind power, solar power, and I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that we also, if we do want to reduce our carbon footprint, and I believe the mayor entered into an agreement with a number of mayors around this area to have a zero carbon footprint by the year 2050, I believe is what I read in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=293.448s">And</a>  this will go a long way to not only reduce our carbon footprint, Mr. President, but it also sends a message to the community at large that, you know, we're just not going to preach this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=305.532s">We're</a>  going to practice this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=307.213s">And</a>  we're going to do it in our municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=309.193s">We're</a>  going to do it in our school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=311.034s">And</a>  we're going to make sure that we're taking advantage of any possible savings that we can pass on to the taxpayer of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=319.777s">I</a>  think it's a sad commentary, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=323.538s">when</a>  Stop and Shop in Wellington Circle is featured as the largest solar array with 240 kilowatt system, over 800 panels, as the largest solar use in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=342.205s">One</a>  little store is the largest use in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=347.467s">Grace</a>  Episcopal Church, back a few years ago, I believe it was in 2013, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=352.519s">They</a>  signed a 10 year lease for panels and it's going to account for 75% of their electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=359.792s">So</a>  I applaud the Grace Episcopal Church for being proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=364.409s">and</a>  moving forward on ways that they can conserve and provide alternative power, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=371.377s">So</a>  I offer this tonight as a way of possibly getting our Energy and Environment Office to start talking about some meaningful carbon footprint reductions that can be done from an administrative level. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=386.468s">And</a>  I think this is one initiative that's worthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=389.91s">It's</a>  being done in all surrounding communities now. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=392.632s">We're</a>  hearing about the benefits of savings in those communities, which is directly tied to taxes and tax relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=401.637s">And</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that a roll call vote be taken that the city-equipped municipal and school buildings with solar, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=412.843s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=416.417s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, I thank my fellow council to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=420.08s">I</a>  think if we can, if we can make amendment to that to add one program that some communities are using now, especially with the local communities taking over local ice rinks and the expenses that are incurred during the cost of electricity for the compressors and what's adjacent at our site, which is the field at Hormel Stadium, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=444.798s">What</a>  some communities are doing are actually bringing in elevated solar farms where they're parking spots that are underneath the solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=458.569s">And</a>  it's something that some communities are doing that are raising money to fund those particular sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=465.154s">So</a>  if we can, if you don't mind, if we can add, you know, public parks and recreational facilities that we can look into that, I think that, because if you look at <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=474.541s">the</a>  expense, especially at hockey rinks, and it's so well needed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=479.604s">And</a>  looking to find a way to attract some sort of revenue or capture some sort of funding to help with that, alleviate some costs maybe to our youth hockey organizations and high school organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=493.972s">That</a>  looking at that type of program I think would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=497.274s">So</a>  if you can, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=501.25s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=502.59s">I</a>  think everybody behind this rail at one point or another has supported green energy initiatives, solar power, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=508.832s">I</a>  think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=510.113s">It's</a>  well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=510.813s">It's</a>  well researched. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=512.033s">I</a>  support it wholeheartedly and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=517.415s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=518.755s">I</a>  want to thank Vice President Marks for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=522.256s">I</a>  think it's a great resolve and it's something that we should be striving to do as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=526.537s">I</a>  know so many homes have gone solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=528.849s">and</a>  more obviously in the works, and we do have a number of people in City Hall that work to raise awareness, whether it be at the winter, the energy festival day or any of the events that we have where we have tables, there's always somebody from <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=546.551s">how</a>  to <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=564.458s">how</a>  good it is for the environment on just a small one home level and what we could do if it was the citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=570.482s">I</a>  think it's something that we should be moving forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=574.024s">I</a>  believe there may be, I thought we did have a few at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=577.567s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=578.247s">I</a>  thought, I think there are, but I think, not in use. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=583.611s">Okay,</a>  well, I know that we may have some at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=586.693s">They</a>  should be in use and having the school system as well as the municipal buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=591.978s">go</a>  solar would save, like you said, I think 45% in Lexington alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=596.7s">And</a>  if we can do the same, it's just definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=600.641s">So</a>  I urge Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=602.362s">Hunt</a>  to give us an update, if we can amend this, just an update on if she's looked into this and any insight we could review before budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=611.926s">And</a>  then I believe that this should definitely be a topic of conversation when we meet with the Energy and Environment Office come a couple weeks when we talk budget, because it's something <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=622.494s">whether</a>  it be an investment or they work like they do with homes, something we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=627.176s">So</a>  thank you, and I second the resolve.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=629.216s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=629.977s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=631.017s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=631.877s">I</a>  also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=634.738s">This</a>  is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=635.919s">I</a>  definitely am in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=639.2s">I</a>  think we should definitely be looking to make sure that all of our city buildings are equipped with this type of technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=646.102s">So</a>  I also wanted to say that I am in support of this, and I thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=652.607s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=654.088s">Two</a>  quick points I forgot to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=657.01s">When</a>  we installed the windmill behind the McGlynn School, you know, it was great to have, I think it captures maybe 15 or 20 percent of the electricity for that particular school, but it was also used as a teaching tool and still to date is used in classrooms as a teaching tool on the effect of <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=680.368s">green</a>  energy and so forth, and the way the mill runs and captures additional excess capacity, which could be sold off, sold to private or other type sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=695.899s">And</a>  this could be an additional also, Mr. President, using this solar energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=703.103s">as</a>  a way of teaching our students in the school system on other ways of capturing energy and ways of providing for a greener environment, which I think we all strive for. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=714.672s">So</a>  it's not just the financial component, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=717.614s">We</a>  all want to save the taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=719.435s">This</a>  has an educational component and potentially could be used to sell off energy <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=729.155s">to</a>  other people that need it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=730.915s">So,</a>  it's a win-win for all.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=733.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=734.336s">And</a>  if anyone noticed, Akati Foods on Commercial Street has done their whole building over with the Solo II, and he's invited us over there to take a tour anytime we want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=744.298s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=747.599s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=749.959s">Andrew</a>  Kast and Eddie Cushon, Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=752.78s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks, for bringing up the windmill. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=755.761s">It</a>  got me thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=757.988s">A</a>  few years back, I was at the energy fair, I believe it's called, and I asked the new head person of the electrical department and some other person that works for the city if they could tell me how much energy it generated, dollar for dollar, what the cost would have been initially to build it if we had to pay for it out of our pocket, what the return is for the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=783.601s">And</a>  they didn't have any answer whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=787.225s">First</a>  of all, and I believe it's a great idea to use anything that's natural, wind, solar, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=797.49s">Supposedly</a>  this country put man on the moon 12 or 13 times and returned them safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=804.894s">If</a>  that is true, I believe there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=810.237s">There's</a>  only probably one good reason and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=814.54s">Mr.</a>  President Bush holding hands with the Arabs on his Texas ranch. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=819.182s">Capitalism,</a>  I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=821.684s">It</a>  makes great sense, I just would like to know if it's cost effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=827.827s">If</a>  you put up a dollar, do you get your dollar back? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=832.89s">That's</a>  all I have to say, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=834.39s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=835.891s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, a roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=920.396s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=921.596s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=923.437s">This</a>  week we got very exciting news that the Fiscal Control Board has moved and appropriated funds to bring the Greenland Extension to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=930.559s">So</a>  right now we have a $57 million appropriation for project and construction management of the Greenland Extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=936.68s">Included</a>  in part of that money, Mr. President, is $8.7 million to provide infrastructure repairs and signal preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=943.622s">A</a>  lot of this work is going to be done on the corridor that runs parallel to Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=947.105s">A</a>  lot of this work is going to be done on property that abuts residential neighborhoods and residential properties, residential parcels, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=954.702s">As</a>  such, I think it's very important that we share the information from the MBTA with our community, when they're going to be in there, what type of work they're going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=960.944s">And</a>  I think the best way to accomplish that, Mr. President, would be by assigning a city liaison that's responsible to address all questions and concerns related to the Green Line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=969.788s">Therefore,</a>  Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=972.248s">I</a>  hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=976.877s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=978.498s">I</a>  want to thank my colleague for making this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=981.481s">That's</a>  one thing that's lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=982.762s">They've</a>  already begun construction in work. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=985.304s">They've</a>  been clearing brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=986.825s">They've</a>  been doing adjustments to the land back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=990.628s">They</a>  have construction crews on site that are using warning horns in anticipation of the arrival of the trains coming rumbling through. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1003.701s">So</a>  this has already been underway, there hasn't been a point person on behalf of the project management team. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1010.503s">Projects</a>  receive some federal funding too, if I understand correctly, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1014.924s">And</a>  so this is a wonderful measure that will give people in the neighborhood a person that they can discuss their concerns with. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1023.747s">A</a>  great many of the people that live in the neighborhood have been very active in this project, and they deserve the best.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1089.231s">If</a>  I can, again, I thank fellow council and I for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1093.894s">As</a>  we move forward, I too have been, as we move forward with the MBTA and issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1101.098s">Last</a>  week, I believe I got three out of the five business days, there were pitches again from High Street and Main with more construction work being done, moving the bus stop down 30 more feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1114.446s">And</a>  again, buses being off the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1117.488s">I'm</a>  going to hope to put a resolution for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1122.314s">I'm</a>  sorry, but the concern is what we're asking for, and I appreciate the reason why I bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1128.389s">is</a>  as we're asking the MBTA in this great job that they're doing with this great, you know, this great initiative that there's still the basic concerns that we have still have to be met. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1139.911s">And</a>  I think that, uh, uh, I will move forward next week to put a resolution in to, uh, eliminate that bus stop until the construction is done on that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1148.533s">So</a>  I do, whether that it's not an amendment, but just an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1152.254s">But</a>  I think how it's a knife for bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1154.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1155.415s">Counsel</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1157.638s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor, Vice President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1162.379s">While</a>  we're talking about the MBTA, if we can get a correspondence or a report back on the request by this council to move the bus stop that was in front of Bogginspot Liquors on a temporary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1176.803s">I</a>  don't think we've received a response yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1178.704s">It</a>  hasn't gone out yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1185.0s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1186.521s">If</a>  we could follow up, because the construction has started in the West Medford parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1191.742s">So</a>  I would ask that if we could just follow up with the T to see how long this process is going to take, it would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1371.023s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, this is one of the perennial issues that we try to deal with each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1378.507s">The</a>  bottom of Fulton Street across from the ball field <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1382.501s">Continually</a>  is an area where speeding happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1388.324s">There's</a>  been several recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1389.765s">I</a>  think Council Longo offered one not too long ago to put the electronic speed sign on that particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1396.109s">I</a>  know I've offered it on several times, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1399.465s">And</a>  again, I'm getting calls from area residents that are afraid to go outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1404.109s">That's</a>  how fast the cars are coming down from the hill to that lower part of Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1409.673s">And</a>  they're very concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1412.195s">There</a>  was just a major accident in the town of Sandwich, where two senior citizens were struck and killed, Mr. President, walking in a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1421.391s">So</a>  when I bring these issues up, Mr. President, it's not just to vent or to make hard ear. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1427.595s">It's</a>  to actually get results when it comes to pedestrian safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1432.178s">And,</a>  you know, I'm tired of talking about unpainted crosswalks, about speeding on our streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1439.303s">You</a>  know, several months back, we voted unanimously to lower the speed limit from 30 to 25 on all non-posted roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1448.172s">I</a>  haven't seen one sign erected yet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1452.255s">Not</a>  one sign alerting residents of this community, you know what, there's a change in our ordinances that only allow you to drive 25 on non-posted roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1462.923s">That's</a>  a huge change in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1465.165s">When</a>  surrounding communities did it, they posted it through electronic billboards, they sent out messages, they, you know, they did a great job getting it out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1475.252s">I</a>  haven't heard anything in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1477.213s">Nothing</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1478.194s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, in addition to what was just mentioned, that the reduction in speed on all non-posted roads to 25 be promoted in this city through either reverse 911, which I get three calls a night, or through other means, maybe the electronic billboard posted strategically and entranceways to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1501.091s">But</a>  we have to get the message out, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1503.372s">And</a>  we also have to start erecting these signs that take down the old 30 mile an hour and put up to 25 mile an hour in the interest of public safety.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1652.548s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, there was some recent road work done on Hutchins Road, and they beautifully paved a portion of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1661.032s">And</a>  right where that portion stops, there's several giant potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1667.215s">So</a>  if they went another three feet, we would have covered all these potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1670.537s">But</a>  apparently, they only go to whatever the parameters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1674.438s">But</a>  in the interest of public safety, Mr. President, those potholes have to be repaired immediately in front of 55 Hutchins Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1682.616s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1719.227s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1720.608s">Again,</a>  there was road work done recently, utility road work on Placet Road across from Placet Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1727.512s">The</a>  utility work is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1729.473s">They</a>  left the site a complete mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1732.215s">The</a>  trucks that were there from the utility company rode over the curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1736.597s">and</a>  broke the curbing in front of the homeowner's home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1740.459s">And</a>  really, someone from a building department or from the city needs to go out there and find out what's happening, why the site was left in such terrible condition, and why municipal property, which was damaged, has not been brought to the attention of the utility company, which pulls a bond <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1761.67s">and</a>  requires them, Mr. President, I believe it's a million-dollar or so bond, requires them, if any damage is done, to replace the damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1769.376s">The</a>  only way the damage is going to be replaced is if the city, as a clerk of the work, that calls these utility companies, as Councilor Scarpelli has mentioned ad nauseam, calls these utility companies on the carpet. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1781.966s">And</a>  it's not happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1784.208s">They're</a>  leaving job sites a filthy mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1787.063s">And</a>  it's a disgrace, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1788.924s">It</a>  shouldn't be happening on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1790.964s">So</a>  I would ask that that curb be repaired immediately and that someone from the building department go out there and address the issue of the broken curb, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1803.689s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1805.19s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1806.473s">Mr.</a>  President, I would once again request that the Engineering Department respond to Council Resolution 16-404. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1813.618s">This</a>  resolution requested a breakdown of all streets that were opened by public utilities from January 1st, 2014 to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1820.903s">It's</a>  been 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1822.624s">We</a>  have not received this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1823.785s">Now,</a>  Councilor Marks puts a resolution on about 123 Place that Road and public utilities being out there, and it leads me to question as to whether or not our Engineering Department knows <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1832.891s">when</a>  public utilities are going out and tearing up our streets because, quite frankly, I don't think it takes 18 months to get a response for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1839.133s">So</a>  with that being said, I wholeheartedly support the resolution and I second the proposal.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1944.043s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1945.724s">I've</a>  got some complaints about the speeding and the heavy trucking on those two streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1951.245s">Multiple</a>  people on South have complained recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1954.726s">The</a>  Mack trucks are coming down South, there are manhole <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1958.738s">covers</a>  that are sinking a little bit, so it hits the manhole and houses are shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1963.62s">I</a>  think we all got an email today from another woman that has been complaining for several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1969.802s">We've</a>  talked about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1970.902s">I</a>  believe this is the third time just from her and her neighbors complaining that it's come up on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1978.465s">And</a>  the speeding and the heavy trucking, we need to do something to deter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1983.187s">And</a>  I know we've all spoken about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1984.868s">We've</a>  mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1987.188s">Striping,</a>  we've mentioned raised crosswalks, and I'm sure it'll be mentioned again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=1991.909s">But</a>  also, I know there's no necessarily four-way intersection there, but it was asked if we could do stop signs, one or two, maybe at Curtis, maybe at Walnut. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2002.951s">You</a>  have hundreds of people walking from Medford Square down South Street Court down into Walnut Street, hundreds of people crossing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2011.732s">So</a>  we could possibly put a stop sign just to slow people down. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2017.278s">I</a>  know that that is maybe is the easier resolve than raised crosswalks because it falls on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2024.545s">But</a>  you have the raised crosswalk on Winthrop and then you come down and take the turn onto South and right after the raised crosswalk you get in complaints that people are picking up the speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2035.013s">It</a>  works to deter it in that part of Winthrop, and then people picking up speed, taking the turn, and flying down South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2041.178s">Now</a>  when you have these Mack trucks doing it at night, it almost sounds like the airplane noise that everybody else in the city is suffering from. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2048.624s">So</a>  it's disturbing, it's a public safety concern, and it's really messing with people's quiet enjoyment of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2057.092s">And</a>  it's come to a point where something needs to be done, and I'm not even sure if we've got a response on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2063.974s">I</a>  do know that the traffic division was out over the last few days doing some ticketing and monitoring, and I'm very thankful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2072.76s">We</a>  do need the speed monitor sign there for several weeks to just let people know what the speed limit is and how fast they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2080.926s">But</a>  also, whether it be speed bumps or I'm proposing a couple stop signs on South Street, I think that would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2089.736s">And</a>  I also know Harvard Street is suffering from the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2092.558s">I</a>  think you have the truck routes that are coming down Harvard or South. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2096.46s">And</a>  it's just not a good place to, obviously, have your windows open on a summer night and when you're here and speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2104.004s">Or</a>  it's definitely a public safety concern if you're trying to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2108.286s">So</a>  I would propose that this be on the Traffic Commission's June agenda, if we could make that a part of the resolution, that stop signs on South Street be part of the Traffic Commission's <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2120.21s">agenda</a>  come June, and we'd be notified of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2124.291s">That</a>  would be helpful, because that's something I would like to plan on attending. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2129.293s">And</a>  I think a lot of people on South would, too.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2132.594s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2133.134s">I'd</a>  also just want to make sure that we're, you know, I know Traffic Division's been on South. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2136.936s">I</a>  want to make sure they're also on Harvard, so that we can try to deter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2140.257s">And</a>  trucks are going to drive down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2142.637s">I</a>  know we did make Harvard no trucking, but then the signs were taken down per the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2148.196s">we</a>  need to make sure they're at least following the speed limit and do something for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2152.619s">Um,</a>  and I appreciate my council support. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2155.441s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2298.794s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2299.734s">I</a>  thank my council colleague for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2302.396s">Um,</a>  if I'm, if I recall right, I think it was a year and a half ago, this council was told that there was a traffic engineering study being done at the corner of Winthrop and Salt Street to improve pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2315.244s">Uh,</a>  that is a terrible, terrible intersection, uh, with cars coming, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2319.817s">down</a>  Winthrop trying to take a left onto South or coming down the other side of Winthrop trying to take a right onto South. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2327.102s">And</a>  if we can get an update on that traffic engineering study, the way it sounded, the money was there, the study was done, and I think people are waiting to see, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2341.613s">results,</a>  and we have yet to see any. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2344.515s">You</a>  know, several years back, Mr. President, and you know, it didn't meet much fanfare, but I offered several resolutions to create a trucking team within the City of Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2357.463s">And</a>  other communities have them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2360.045s">I</a>  know the state police does a fair amount of trucking violations within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2366.169s">We</a>  have major trucking routes that run throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2370.452s">And</a>  our police department, to be quite frank with you, their hands are tied when it comes to these 18-wheelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2377.197s">First</a>  of all, we don't have the equipment to do the testing of capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2382.041s">We</a>  don't have the equipment that weighs vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2385.644s">We</a>  don't have a trucking team that's equipped to pull these 18-wheelers over and are trained to look at the logs that the drivers are supposed to keep by state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2397.634s">And</a>  I think we fall short of the mark protecting not only our city roads, but our residents, Mr. President, from these 18-wheelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2406.661s">that</a>  are traversing down quite residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2410.824s">And,</a>  you know, I keep referring to Scintilli Circle because I live in the Wellington area, but we all remember what took place back some years ago when there was an oil truck that tipped over in Scintilli Circle and lit part of the senior housing on fire because, Mr. President, the driver was speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2429.175s">And</a>  I think it would go a long way and pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2432.598s">When</a>  you pull an 18-wheeler over, it's not a $50 or $100 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2436.602s">It's</a>  upward from what I'm being told, $1,500 to $2,000 when they start going through the potential violations for these 18-wheelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2445.95s">So</a>  I would recommend, Mr. President, that the administration once again look into the creation <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2452.472s">of</a>  a trucking team within the police department to serve as the eyes and ears on our roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2460.097s">In</a>  particular, when you have other communities that are diverting these trucks off their roads, we seem to be getting the brunt of it in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2467.741s">And</a>  I think after time, you know, the truckers all talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2471.383s">You</a>  know, they say, gee, where's the best lease resistance that we can go and not worry? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2476.865s">And</a>  I guarantee you, the city of Medford's a good route to take, Mr. President, because we're ill-equipped to be pulling these trucks over. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2485.289s">And</a>  I don't think we can depend on state police to do all our policing in the community when it comes to these heavy trucks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2492.512s">So</a>  I thank Council Member Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2495.545s">and</a>  hope that Chief Sacco and the administration, you know, train some officers and create a trucking team, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2502.93s">Councilor</a>  Knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2504.211s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2504.892s">I</a>  think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2505.892s">But</a>  in the interim, however, we do not going to have a trucking team. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2508.394s">So</a>  I'd like to further amend the resolution requesting that the state police established directed patrols at South Street and at Harvard Street for the purpose of monitoring trucking with their truck division.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2519.422s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2521.664s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Alango-Kern, as amended by Councilor Naith, Councilor Dello Russo and Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2531.515s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2533.297s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2535.099s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2536.14s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2538.062s">Rob</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2541.314s">This</a>  matter about the trucking has come up at the Method Police community meetings, and even if they had all of the equipment, they can't do it because of the traffic that would back up behind those trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2556.699s">I</a>  forget the detective's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2558.98s">I</a>  directly asked him to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2561.797s">from</a>  seeing the way 18 wheelers turn right here out at the point at the, at the citizens bank out at century bank, uh, they physically can't do it even if they had had the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2573.926s">I,</a>  I would support, uh, what councilor Knight offered, which is have the state police do it outside the city limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2582.153s">So</a>  as not to congest the city, they do it on route 16.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2586.576s">Currently</a>  they do it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2589.293s">I</a>  brought this up at the community police meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2591.794s">They</a>  said right out to me, they physically can't do it because of the traffic nightmare that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2596.997s">Those</a>  truck pullovers, they take a long, long time to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2603.46s">I'm</a>  just giving you the information I got directly from the Method Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2607.742s">And</a>  also, too, on the matter, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2610.484s">One</a>  of the information, Vice President Fox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2614.966s">And</a>  I appreciate Mr. Cappucci bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2617.705s">I</a>  think it sends a bad message. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2619.385s">And</a>  I didn't hear it from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2621.306s">But</a>  the fact that they're not willing to pull trucks over because it may create a concern with traffic congestion, to me, is a ridiculous statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2630.868s">Because</a>  we're trying to pull trucks over that may be in violation of traffic particular citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2639.39s">And</a>  to say we don't have space to pull them over is, I see them pulled over on the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2643.851s">If</a>  you want to talk about a busy road, there's ways of doing it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2647.592s">to</a>  keep traffic without impeding traffic and also providing public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2652.181s">So</a>  I hope that's not the reason why we're not doing it in this community Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2655.929s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2658.095s">It's</a>  not that they're not willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2659.956s">It's</a>  just that we're a current force of only 104 officers and not having the necessary capacity to do these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2668.16s">They're</a>  definitely willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2669.4s">They</a>  definitely want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2670.941s">But</a>  they looked at it, Councilor, and it's physically not possible for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2677.424s">They</a>  want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2678.405s">Of</a>  course they want to do it and provide public safety at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2682.346s">I</a>  hope I didn't give them this information.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2686.247s">With</a>  all due respect to the gentleman behind the rail, I think that it would be best if we heard what they do and don't want to do from the police department, not the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2692.588s">I</a>  understand that he does attend the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2694.189s">However,</a>  we are sending a resolution forward and we're asking for certain information. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2697.549s">We</a>  want that information to come back from the police department and I don't want to deter from that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2701.57s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2702.23s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2704.171s">I</a>  would agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2705.471s">Talk</a>  directly to the police and I'm sure they're going to confirm exactly what, what I just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2710.773s">On</a>  the matter of what Councilor Dello Russo brought up about the low-flying planes and the noise, I read an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2718.376s">Maybe</a>  some of you saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2719.337s">I</a>  posted it around Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2722.258s">There</a>  is a problem in Los Angeles out of LAX. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2725.82s">It's</a>  a health problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2728.141s">These</a>  low-flying planes are producing <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2731.856s">something</a>  called ultrafine particles that are hurting respiratory systems of people that are going to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2740.64s">These</a>  low-flying planes, I mean, I know the city council, it's up to our state and our federal delegation to do something, but maybe the city council as a body can look into this article. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2751.966s">I</a>  can send it to you and see what their findings were. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2754.847s">It's</a>  in communities 10 miles around <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2757.228s">LAX,</a>  we're what, seven, eight miles away from Logan, and we are, from that presentation given by Massport a few weeks ago, we are ground zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2768.331s">Medford</a>  is directly being assaulted by these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2771.571s">I</a>  mean, the noise is definitely a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2773.952s">But</a>  I went to the hospital a couple weeks ago because I had upper respiratory problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2781.373s">I</a>  got some medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2782.814s">There</a>  was one person waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2785.178s">in</a>  the urgent care waiting room and two people on either side of me with the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2790.62s">Another</a>  person had it that I'm currently seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2795.742s">And</a>  we should probably look into, you know, medical records going on and determine if these ultrafine particles are <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2806.862s">invading</a>  our airspace and falling on our schools and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2811.926s">The</a>  noise could be a small problem compared to something that could be much larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2816.731s">Thank</a>  you for your time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2819.513s">Council</a>  Member O'Kane. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2822.836s">Mr.</a>  Cappucci, if you don't mind sending us that article. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2825.858s">I</a>  think we spoke about this a couple weeks ago and I did bring it up and asked Alicia Hunt, our environmental <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2832.017s">agent</a>  we probably should ask even the health department to if they've done any research if they know of anything like this and Obviously try to move forward to get them to fly higher I guess that's might be our only option from that presentation, but something definitely needs to be done with the noise and Obviously this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=2850.834s">It's</a>  very disturbing.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3035.006s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez from 281 Park Street, and I'm just here to promote the Medford Citywide Yard Sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3041.689s">This</a>  is a great eco-friendly fundraiser that will have no negative effects on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3046.992s">I</a>  got the idea from running the Roberts Elementary Yard Sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3050.353s">We've</a>  run four of them, and each time we've raised $1,000 for enrichment in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3054.915s">So</a>  I thought that citywide would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3057.477s">We</a>  pay for trash, so why throw things out that are still good that others can use? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3061.999s">So</a>  the plan is on June 10th, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3064.76s">People</a>  will register ahead of time for $25, and your address will appear on a citywide map. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3070.205s">If</a>  you don't have a yard, then you can sell at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3072.967s">So</a>  we'll have tables set up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3074.168s">We</a>  have the shell reserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3076.09s">And</a>  people will shop around to all the different yard sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3079.593s">And</a>  it'll be great, because the money will go towards the Friends of Felsmere Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3085.037s">Anyone</a>  that doesn't know what the Friends of Felsmere Heights is, <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3089.31s">They</a>  approached me after they found me involved with the 61 Locust Street development and the working to right-size the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3096.972s">So</a>  we share a common goal of stopping overdevelopment that they think will be detrimental to the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3102.833s">They</a>  want to work with Medford and Malden officials to purchase the Malden Hospital property and return the majority of the land to Parkland with an appropriate size development. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3111.895s">The</a>  purchase would be made with a combination of CPA funds, grants, as well as donations and fundraisers such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3119.497s">So</a>  this project, if that project went through, it would have a seriously negative effect on the Fulton Heights area. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3126.041s">So</a>  it's very relevant to Medford residents to try to move this project forward and stop that area from being overdeveloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3133.827s">Because</a>  several hundred more cars coming down Fulton Spring and Fulton Street would be very detrimental to the quality of life of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3142.405s">So</a>  this group has also generously agreed to split their proceeds with the abutters for the 61 Locust Street or Old Shaw's project. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3150.572s">As</a>  residents and myself, I feel it's important to come out and support them in their fight for their neighborhood as well as the rest of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3158.779s">Because</a>  once there's overdevelopment, overcrowding in our schools, it's going to be too late to turn that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3163.923s">So</a>  we have to be proactive and work hard for that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3166.945s">So</a>  I hope that many of you will join me in registering for this yard sale on June 10th to support our neighborhoods and protect them from overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3175.988s">We</a>  have a Facebook page, the Medford Citywide Yard Sale Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3179.609s">We</a>  also have an email address, MedfordCityYardSale at gmail.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3184.631s">So</a>  the yard sale will be on June 10th from 9 to 2 and I hope to see many of you there.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3205.07s">I</a>  don't believe there'll be a reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3206.471s">We're</a>  going to advertise the event on the billboard, so it'll have our Facebook information so that people can go there for maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3212.112s">There</a>  will be maps available on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3214.553s">I'm</a>  hoping that there will be some available a little earlier than that, perhaps at the city hall or the library.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3220.519s">It's</a>  really should people like maybe start at the condon shell and there'll be maps there. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3224.021s">So</a>  if they want to go to different homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3225.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3226.603s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3227.463s">Great</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3227.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3228.204s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3349.931s">I</a>  have asked several times and they are working on them and that was the answer I have.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3356.893s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3357.113s">And</a>  then with, so did they give you any insight with regards to when we could start our budget?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3363.12s">Again,</a>  I asked, I said, if we have some of the departments, if we could get started on them, they would like to wait until they're fully complete and do it all at once.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3372.864s">Do</a>  it all at once, so what is our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3375.205s">Are</a>  we going to do a full Saturday? <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3377.226s">Are</a>  we going to do several nights?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3378.487s">As</a>  soon as we get them, I have asked several times for them, and they're working on them, and hopefully we'll have them shortly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3384.489s">So</a>  we can maybe, through the chair, ask as a body.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3388.891s">Mr.</a>  Burke, if you could make a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3392.39s">To</a>  the mayor When the budget will be ready So that we could maybe have it for a week before we start meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3398.976s">They'll</a>  be I would like they have made I've made multiple requests as I know we all want to Study them before we do it so we don't have problems that we have in the past Council tonight Mr. President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3565.955s">I</a>  believe the two papers that got referred to the subcommittee were one to create a sign ordinance relative to street sweeping, and the other one would be a 30 day requirement to remove stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3574.881s">Those</a>  are the two papers I believe that were referred to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3577.543s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/df7KI7XVxCQ&t=3578.704s">I</a>  think we asked for a committee of the whole meeting with the DPW director to discuss potholes throughout our city.</p>
