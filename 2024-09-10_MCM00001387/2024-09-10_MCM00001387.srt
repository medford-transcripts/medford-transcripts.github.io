00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,936

36
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to sever June 24th.

37
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to sever June 24th by Member Reinfeld, seconded by?

38
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,402
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an error.

39
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,522
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't need a second or any vote.

40
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,023
[SPEAKER_08]: No need for a second?

41
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,024
[SPEAKER_19]: No second or vote.

42
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:22,587
[SPEAKER_19]: Also motion to sever the capital purchases.

43
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:26,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to sever the capital purchases by Member Ruseau.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,503
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'd like to amend the teacher, the approval of the teacher budget line item.

45
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:37,525
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.

46
00:02:38,586 --> 00:02:40,807
[SPEAKER_06]: There were two abstentions, no no votes.

47
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:42,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

48
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:47,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So making that correction on the June 24th, 2024 meeting minutes.

49
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:54,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you want to vote on them separately since you severed them or do you just, did you just want to amend them?

50
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:56,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just amend them.

51
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:57,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Just amend them, okay.

52
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,180
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're amending the,

53
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,032
[SPEAKER_08]: June 24th, 2024 minutes.

54
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:14,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And motion to approve everything, including the amendments from June 24th, 2024, other than the capital purchases.

55
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor by?

56
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:18,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion.

57
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:20,865
[SPEAKER_08]: By member Ruseau, seconded by?

58
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:21,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

59
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:22,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Intoppa.

60
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,047
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

61
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:24,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

62
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:25,788
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

63
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill's consent agenda is approved.

64
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,477
[SPEAKER_08]: We have reports of subcommittees.

65
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,422
[SPEAKER_08]: First up is our superintendents updates and- Capital one.

66
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Capital purchases.

67
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Capital purchases, sorry.

68
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Number four, member Ruseau.

69
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:55,036
[SPEAKER_19]: I just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.

70
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

71
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:06,646
[SPEAKER_18]: As part of my later operations report, I talk about the Brooks domestic hot water heater.

72
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:11,450
[SPEAKER_18]: A quick view as it relates to capital projects, we're not ready to purchase just yet.

73
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:24,299
[SPEAKER_18]: However, the two alternatives B2Q provided for us, one is a condensing hot water heater that has significant efficiencies, but still runs off of natural gas.

74
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:29,260
[SPEAKER_18]: The price point is in the $92,000 range.

75
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:33,942
[SPEAKER_18]: They suggest, with incidentals and other things, budgeting up to $150,000.

76
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:39,304
[SPEAKER_18]: The alternative three, if I remember correctly, is in the neighborhood of $349,000 for full electric.

77
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:57,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, despite the natural gas unit, condensing hot water heater will allow the city to still make tremendous strides towards our sustainability and environmental goals.

78
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,101
[SPEAKER_18]: But given the return on investments,

79
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:07,364
[SPEAKER_18]: versus $349,000 and the lifespan of these pieces of equipment, which at most is 15 years.

80
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:20,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it would not be a recommendation of myself or other members of the city and school staff that have been part of these phone calls and meetings, uh, to recommend the full electric.

81
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, ma'am,

82
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:33,923
[SPEAKER_18]: So before we move forward with design heading into purchasing, I wanted to bring it before the committee because of the stated goals of the committee and the district.

83
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:36,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

84
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:37,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

85
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,651
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay.

86
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:44,833
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion to table.

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to table, yes.

88
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:50,223
[SPEAKER_08]: By Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

89
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,144
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

90
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:52,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

91
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:52,885
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

92
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Capital purchases is tabled.

93
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

94
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,390
[SPEAKER_08]: We have superintendents updates and comments.

95
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna turn it over to Dr. Maurice Edward-Vinson, our superintendent.

96
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:08,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

97
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:12,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to our first school committee meeting of the year.

98
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:22,018
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you all had a restful and enjoyable summer and that you're as excited as I am to dive into a new school year full of possibilities.

99
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:33,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we get started, I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of everyone who worked tirelessly over the summer to prepare for this school year.

100
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:43,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether it was undergoing professional development, updating curricula, or getting our facilities ready, your hard work has not gone unnoticed.

101
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:55,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Throughout the summer and in the early stages of the school year, we were fortunate to receive multiple donations of school supplies from our Medford community.

102
00:06:57,092 --> 00:07:15,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn and everyone who donated to the mayor's annual summer school supply drive, while also recognizing our Medford High girls varsity basketball team for dropping the supplies off at the high school.

103
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:27,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to thank the Members Plus Credit Union located on High Street for donating 50 backpacks full of school supplies last week.

104
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:35,110
[SPEAKER_14]: To everyone who donated to our schools, we sincerely appreciate your warmth and kindness.

105
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,912
[SPEAKER_14]: I also would like to thank the Medford Family Network for donations to the schools as well.

106
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, thank you for your support of the Medford Public Schools.

107
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:55,660
[SPEAKER_14]: The 2024-25 school year unofficially began on Monday, August 19th, during new teacher induction week.

108
00:07:56,681 --> 00:08:08,050
[SPEAKER_14]: With over 60 new educators and paraprofessionals across the district at that point in time, the week served as a tremendous opportunity to welcome our new staff to Medford.

109
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:13,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Among the many activities they participated in was a tour of our beautiful city.

110
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:24,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Our new educators visited Tufts University, the Medford Public Library, and here, the Chambers of City Hall, where they spoke with the mayor.

111
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:37,857
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Tufts University Community Relations Director Rocco DiRico, the Medford Public Library, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn for hosting our new educators and informing them about our community.

112
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:50,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I would like to send a special thank you to Medford High School Assistant Principal, Mr. David Blouk, and Brooks Elementary School Kindergarten Teacher, Ms.

113
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:57,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Maria Michelli, two long-time residents with extensive knowledge of our city for leading the tour.

114
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:04,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to welcome our new administrators as well, joining us for this school year.

115
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:10,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of them you've already met at the end of the school year, so I will not reintroduce them again.

116
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,258
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would like to formally welcome Ms.

117
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:21,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie Bradley, who is named as our special education coordinator for the Missituk and the Roberts Elementary School.

118
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:23,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanna welcome Ms.

119
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:32,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Suzanne Fee, who is our coordinator of arts, who you'll be hearing from later on while recapping our summer programming.

120
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:41,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, but definitely not least, among our other new administrative hires, I'd like to formally welcome, again, Ms.

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:48,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Jennifer Silver, a longtime nurse at Medford Public Schools, who recently became our Director of Health Services.

122
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:52,470
[SPEAKER_14]: We're so lucky to have all of you here with us at Medford.

123
00:09:54,364 --> 00:10:01,727
[SPEAKER_14]: So on Monday, August 26th, that was the first day of school for all of our teachers and staff members.

124
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:07,750
[SPEAKER_14]: We all gathered at Medford High School gym before staff dispersed to their respective buildings.

125
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:15,033
[SPEAKER_14]: It was wonderful to see so many familiar faces and feel the excitement buzzing through the air.

126
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,934
[SPEAKER_14]: On Tuesday, August 27th,

127
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,838
[SPEAKER_14]: That was our first day of school for our students in grades 1 through 12.

128
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had the privilege of visiting all of our schools across the first few days of the new year.

129
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:36,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Our students reconnected with friends, met their new teachers, and began to understand their new surroundings.

130
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,795
[SPEAKER_14]: The passion of our teachers, administration, and staff was evident throughout the district.

131
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:58,261
[SPEAKER_14]: With our MEEP program beginning on Tuesday, September 3rd, and kindergarten students following that Wednesday, joining our hallways, our school community is officially all together again.

132
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:04,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I will transition to news happening across the district.

133
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:15,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford High School made national headlines this summer for their positive work in battling chronic absenteeism.

134
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:21,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Chronic absenteeism is defined as when students miss 10% of the school year.

135
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,441
[SPEAKER_14]: To battle this issue, among many initiatives implemented by high school principal Ms.

136
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:44,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral and her team, students had the opportunity to use the gym during lunch hours for organized sports and other supervised activities, as long as they attended all of their classes.

137
00:11:46,296 --> 00:12:00,159
[SPEAKER_14]: This use of the gym space quickly gained popularity amongst the students, leading to Medford High School experiencing one of the steepest declines in chronic absenteeism among all Massachusetts high schools.

138
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:13,963
[SPEAKER_14]: This story was first featured in the Associated Press, and given that they are a wire news service, was featured across the country in various outlets, such as the Boston Globe,

139
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:17,445
[SPEAKER_14]: the Seattle Times, the U.S.

140
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: News and World Report, and more.

141
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:25,851
[SPEAKER_14]: NBC 10 also stopped by a few days later to speak with Ms.

142
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:33,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral and our students in a video package that featured on the nightly news and in digital outlets.

143
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:45,332
[SPEAKER_14]: NBC 10 went on to inform us that this story is one of their most viewed videos on both TikTok and YouTube shorts.

144
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,836
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations on going viral, Ms.

145
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:49,257

00:12:54,914 --> 00:13:03,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral and the staff at Medford High School and our students have shown towards tackling this important issue of chronic absenteeism.

148
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:13,782
[SPEAKER_14]: The tremendous reach of this story is gratifying for our school leaders and a marvelous example of the impact we have as educators.

00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:16,223

150
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:33,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving to the sports realm, the United Soccer Coaches Team Academic Achievement Award was presented to the Medford High School Mustangs girls soccer team for the fourth consecutive year.

151

152
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:53,810
[SPEAKER_14]: The team's achievement of a 3.25 or higher composite grade point average encompassing all players earned them this unique distinction.

153
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:04,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Notably, they are one of only six Massachusetts High School girls soccer teams to receive the award this year.

154
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:16,496
[SPEAKER_14]: To our players and coaches, Coach Roccocieri, we are so proud of you for fostering an environment of success both on the field and in the classroom.

155
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,257

172
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:22,715
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of wonderful things happening in the arts.

173
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:32,101
[SPEAKER_14]: For our listening community members, this week is the kickoff of all of our school curriculum nights.

174
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:42,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Curriculum nights serve as a wonderful opportunity for parents and caregivers to meet your child's teacher and school leaders.

175
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:48,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Parents and caregivers will hear more about what your child will be learning throughout the school year.

176
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,919
[SPEAKER_14]: the Roberts Elementary School, and the Andrews Middle School.

177
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:59,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Their curriculum night will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, September 10th.

178
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:07,186
[SPEAKER_14]: The Missittuck and Brooks Elementary School will host their curriculum nights on Wednesday, September 11th.

00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:46,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Please visit your respective child's school website for start times and additional information.

184
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:56,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanna just notify the community that next Wednesday, September 18th, will be our half day.

185
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers will be undergoing professional development sessions in the afternoon.

186
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:09,311
[SPEAKER_14]: These professional development sessions often provide opportunities for teachers to collaborate with peers,

187
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:21,514
[SPEAKER_14]: share experiences, build a supportive professional community, and this collaboration leads to a more cohesive school culture and collective problem solving.

188
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:51,376
[SPEAKER_14]: So before preview previewing the rest of tonight's agenda, and in reflection of the events that took place last week in Winder, Georgia, and ahead of the 23rd anniversary of September 11th, I just want to take a brief moment to speak and share on these two tragedies that have left an indelible mark on our nation and on so many lives.

189
00:18:53,430 --> 00:19:06,829
[SPEAKER_14]: We will always remember those who were lost, honor the bravery of first responders, and acknowledge the strength and resilience of all who were affected by these senseless attacks.

190
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:17,764
[SPEAKER_14]: All of our Medford Public Schools staff were reminded again earlier this morning of our school safety protocols through a communication.

191
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:29,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Staff are encouraged to reach out to building principals and senior administrators with any questions relating to our safety procedures.

192
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:38,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Later this evening, there will be a brief mention during the operations presentation later today.

193
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:45,350
[SPEAKER_14]: In our schools, we do strive to foster a community of empathy, understanding, and respect.

194
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:52,256
[SPEAKER_14]: It is important for us to come together to remember and to support one another throughout the year.

195
00:19:53,143 --> 00:20:01,791
[SPEAKER_14]: We uphold the values of unity and compassion that were so profoundly demonstrated in the aftermath of these tragedies.

196
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:14,444
[SPEAKER_14]: So today's agenda is packed with important topics that will encompass wide ranging information about Medford Public Schools.

197
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:25,056
[SPEAKER_14]: We will hear about several grant opportunities that Medford Public Schools has been fortunate enough to receive.

198
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:29,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have school principals here with us this evening.

199
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,441
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Principal Ms.

200
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:36,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Kroll of the Roberts Elementary School and our Principal Ms.

201
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:39,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral here this evening who will be presenting at different points.

202
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:51,741
[SPEAKER_14]: We also hear about summer programming achievements presented by Assistant Superintendent Dr. Galussi, our Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

203
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:56,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Joan Bowen, our Director of Arts, Ms.

204
00:20:56,383 --> 00:21:03,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Suzanne Fee, our Director of English Learners, Mr. Paul Teixeira, and our Principal, Ms.

205
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral from Medford High School.

206
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:13,591
[SPEAKER_14]: These individuals, along with many others, helped shape a great summer in Medford for our students and families.

207
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:33,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Immediately following that, there will be a report on enrollment and personnel update from Dr. Galussi, and the final official presentation will be by Dr. Peter Cushing, giving us an update on operations happening in the Medford public schools,

208
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:44,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanna take a moment to congratulate Dr. Cushing and his wife, Megan, who earlier this summer welcomed a beautiful baby girl to their family.

209
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,208
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations on your new addition, Dr. Cushing.

210
00:21:49,795 --> 00:22:07,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I also would like to just take a moment to say that there was originally a mistake in the first posted agenda that listed the condolences, and by mistake, we mistakenly listed Ms.

211
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Karen McGlynn-Devine,

212
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,271
[SPEAKER_14]: on the condolences section.

213
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to share that Ms.

214
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:18,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Karen McGlynn Devine and myself, we had the opportunity to speak today.

215
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:31,636
[SPEAKER_14]: She is alive and well, has fully accepted our apology for the error that took place when we were sending condolences to her aunt, Ms.

216
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:37,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Pauline Lennox Davis, but we want to just say thank you.

217
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:38,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

218
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:48,062
[SPEAKER_14]: McGlynn-Devine for your understanding, and we apologize for the mistake that took place with the listing.

219
00:22:49,542 --> 00:23:00,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to just say to all, thank you for being here this evening, for your unwavering commitment to our schools in Medford, and I am looking forward to a great year ahead.

220
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:01,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

221
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Minson.

222
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:18,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, we have recommendation to approve $35,000 grant from the Cummings Foundation to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, which is our CCSR group for the 2024-2025 school year.

223
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna turn it over to you again, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

224
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,153
[SPEAKER_14]: So good evening again.

225
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:39,175
[SPEAKER_14]: This recommendation to approve in 2021, the Medford Public Schools was awarded $350,000 from the Cummings Foundation.

226
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:50,477
[SPEAKER_14]: We are truly, truly grateful for the partnership of Mr. Cummings and the Cummings Foundation supporting the Medford Public Schools in a variety of capacities.

227
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:52,637
[SPEAKER_14]: This $35,000 is one of the installments

228
00:23:56,298 --> 00:24:00,701
[SPEAKER_14]: that we will be receiving for the next 10 years.

229
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:20,714
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this is just for the school committee to recognize that you did approve the full grant in the amount of $350,000 in 2021, but we want to acknowledge every time we receive this generous donation from the Cummings Foundation.

230
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:25,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I just want to bring this before the committee again.

231
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:26,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

232
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

233
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion for approval?

234
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:30,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

235
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:31,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

236
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:33,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a quick question or a comment.

237
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:39,329
[SPEAKER_11]: If possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything

238
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:46,148
[SPEAKER_11]: sort of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed.

239
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:57,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff.

240
00:24:58,316 --> 00:25:07,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants.

241
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:11,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the letter that is attached talks about an impact report.

242
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,794
[SPEAKER_11]: That's important because we want to make sure we're doing those things.

243
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,557
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there are other things that sort of.

244
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:28,388
[SPEAKER_11]: outline or restrict or govern in some way our operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve.

245
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:29,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

246
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:29,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

247
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:37,435
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do believe part of the stipulation for the Cummings grant is that we formally state when we receive it.

248
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:40,797
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how it was explained to me, so I'll make sure to do that.

249
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:41,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

250
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:41,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

251
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval.

252
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

253
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:46,522
[SPEAKER_08]: By Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

254
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:47,422
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

255
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:48,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

256
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,363
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

257
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation is approved.

258
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:56,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, we have recommendation to approve $50,000 grant from Ernie Bach Jr.

259
00:25:56,984 --> 00:26:00,925

00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:08,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

264
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:14,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

265
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:20,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for having me here tonight to share some exciting news from the Roberts School.

266
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:36,947
[SPEAKER_15]: After a successful concert last February, where approximately 700 parents attended, it was pretty apparent that we were in need of some updated musical equipment to continue to produce musical performances of this magnitude.

267
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,283
[SPEAKER_15]: In collaboration with Dr. Stern, our music teacher, and Ms.

268
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:48,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Tara Shrest, a Roberts School parent, the Roberts School submitted a grant through Ernie Bach Jr.'

270
00:26:52,669 --> 00:27:00,574
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a competitive grant that schools and organizations in New England can apply for to support existing music programs.

271
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:22,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the summer, the Music Drives Us Foundation notified the Roberts that they were going to award us a grant to purchase 40 new violins for our string students, a new grand piano, new student risers, a classroom set of ukuleles, and a new electric keyboard totaling approximately $50,000.

272
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:33,502
[SPEAKER_15]: We are truly grateful to the Music Drives Us Foundation for this generous grant that will allow us to provide our students with the highest quality music education.

273
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:35,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

274
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:40,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful, Ms.

00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:52,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna turn it over to member Reinfeld and member Ruseau.

278
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

279
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:58,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?

280
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:01,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that there's a limitation.

281
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,420
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's some different criteria.

282
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:10,027
[SPEAKER_15]: So we applied specifically for equipment, but there are some different categories and it's

283
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:20,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I love this, and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also wanna be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.

284
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I would encourage folks to apply.

285
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:24,985
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll be delivering, so Ernie Buck Jr.

286
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:27,707
[SPEAKER_15]: will be coming to the Roberts to do a personal delivery.

287
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:39,697
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let you all know, he wants to, he's inviting everybody, and he shows up with his truck, so we don't have the equipment yet, but he will be delivering everything to our school.

288
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,190
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really just gives opportunity for our kids with music.

289
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:53,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the ukulele set is gonna be something that, you know, our kids learn recorder, which is really exciting, but at the same time, like ukuleles are just so cool, right?

290
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:58,980
[SPEAKER_15]: And so now our kids will have an opportunity to learn the ukulele in our music class.

291
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,102
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's exciting.

292
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:03,088
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great, thank you.

293
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:04,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, do you still have a question?

294
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,652
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it, okay.

295
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, there must be a motion for approval of $50,000 by Member Intoppa.

296
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second?

297
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:11,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

298
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:14,220

00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:16,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

301
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:17,423
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion is passed.

00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:19,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

304
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:20,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

305
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll invite you all when he comes.

306
00:29:22,568 --> 00:29:22,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds great.

[SPEAKER_08]: Number four, we have a recommendation to approve $200,000 grant from the Barr Foundation to Medford High School.

[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

323
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:38,381
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

329
00:30:58,014 --> 00:30:58,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're wonderful.

330
00:30:58,996 --> 00:30:59,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

331
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,644
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a recommendation to approve a field trip for the culinary arts program to visit Johnson and Wales University in Rhode Island.

[SPEAKER_08]: Here to present is Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

333
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:12,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, thank you.

334
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:17,192
[SPEAKER_18]: As you know, all out-of-state and overnight field trips need to come before this body.

335
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:24,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Johnson and Wales is a world-renowned culinary school that is offering 23 students, juniors and seniors,

336
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:34,422
[SPEAKER_18]: the opportunity to come to experience a day there, view the program, their facilities, dorms, and enjoy meals created by their culinary students.

337
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:39,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Recommendation to approve this out-of-state field trip for September 17th.

338
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve, Mayor.

339
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:44,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley.

340
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,869
[SPEAKER_03]: My child is a student in this program, so I don't know if I should abstain from the vote.

341
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:50,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for it, but I don't know if it's a conflict, so.

342
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,451
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a conflict.

343
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

344
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:53,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she attending?

345
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,132
[SPEAKER_03]: She's attending.

346
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:56,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Still not a cop.

347
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

348
00:31:58,554 --> 00:31:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They're telling me it's good.

349
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'll second then.

350
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:04,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to pass, so yeah, you go.

351
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:05,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I want to go.

352
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:07,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to come eat.

353
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, perfect.

354
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval, did I hear?

355
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody did.

356
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:16,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

357
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:17,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we call the roll, Member Ruseau.

358
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:26,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask, that we get the field trip form and all that core details at a subsequent meeting.

359
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:29,910
[SPEAKER_19]: This is happening before our next meeting.

360
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:38,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I can submit it to the committee on buying carbon copies so there's no chance of debate or deliberation.

361
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:46,224
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not suggesting we don't let them go, but we do have a policy requiring that form to be approved before the field trip.

362
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:58,574
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll pretend that I don't know about the policy for a minute, I guess, but just, you know, let's not put these forward without including all the proper paperwork so we don't have that problem.

363
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:01,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I can I just a question on that just being a newbie.

364
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a field trip is within the first couple of weeks.

365
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:09,916
[SPEAKER_03]: and we haven't had time to approve it because this is our first meeting and the field trip is next week.

366
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:11,697
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work policy wise?

367
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious, I just honestly don't know.

368
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

369
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:21,482
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, if the field trip was planned before the end of the school year for the beginning of the school year, then it could be submitted then.

370
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:25,564
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say that we should have a special meeting with a one item agenda.

371
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:43,159
[SPEAKER_19]: We can be in and out in 10 minutes, but we do have that policy because, well, I don't want to rehash history, but that's why we do require that we approve the form with, you know, that nursing looked at it and the nursing has signed off on it and all the other stuff.

372
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:48,703
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sure that will all happen, but we are also supposed to give the sign off on that.

373
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:51,605
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's how I would, now it's of course,

374
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:56,097
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, this could have come up literally a week ago.

375
00:33:57,358 --> 00:34:00,820
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think, you know, we don't exercise special meetings that often.

376
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:09,946
[SPEAKER_19]: We usually save them for like emergencies, but I think we should use them more often for things such as this, so we can comply with our own policies.

377
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:16,210
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion for approval by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

378
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,891
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

379
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:17,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

380
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:18,532
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

381
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:21,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

382
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:25,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the field trip to our 23 students.

383
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Number six, report on summer programming.

384
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:31,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Suzanne B. Galussi, Assistant Superintendent, Ms.

385
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:33,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Joan Bowen, Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

386
00:34:33,924 --> 00:34:38,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Suzanne Fee, Director of Fine Arts, Mr. Paul Taksera, Director of EL, and Ms.

387
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:40,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Marta Cabral, Principal of Medford High School.

388
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll turn it over to you all.

389
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, welcome back.

390
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have one update before I kick it off.

391
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:54,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for introducing everyone.

392
00:34:55,722 --> 00:35:04,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Fee is not here this evening, so I will be covering the music and the art programming as well as the early literacy.

393
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:15,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think if there are any questions, Dr. Chiesa was also instrumental in the early literacy or the literacy program over the summer, so she's also available.

394
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,023
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you very much and I'm going to have Joan Ballenstar first.

395
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening and welcome back.

396
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to report on the extended school year services that were held this summer for our students with disabilities.

397
00:35:33,514 --> 00:35:39,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So each summer, the special education department provides a wide range of services during the extended school year.

398
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,722
[SPEAKER_05]: These are for students who are at risk for substantial regression or experiencing difficulty with recruitment of previous learned skills.

399
00:35:50,322 --> 00:36:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So this year our teams met and 251 students were recommended for a wide variety of specialized services and approximately 201 students attended this year.

400
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:12,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So our special education programs were housed in three different locations.

401
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:21,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We had programs, our access program for middle school and high school that were located at Medford High School.

402
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Missittuck Elementary, we had a wide range of tutoring and related services.

403
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the Roberts Elementary School, we had our ME programming, as well as our Connections program.

404
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:41,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the right-hand side just tells you the breakdown of the different types of programs that we held, as well as how many weeks they run for.

405
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So the programs for our students who require our most vulnerable students is a six-week program, five days per week from July 1st to August 9th.

406
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have four week programs.

407
00:36:55,863 --> 00:37:06,554
[SPEAKER_05]: One is a five week program and that also includes some of our substantially separate programs, it could be language based program learning group program as well as access program.

408
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have a three week.

409
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:17,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a three-day per week, four-week program, and that's for our MEAP students, our language-based students, and our learning group students.

410
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:19,146
[SPEAKER_05]: This is three days per week.

411
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:21,528
[SPEAKER_05]: They come in, they receive their services.

412
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,671
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't require the five-day program.

413
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:29,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly is our tutoring and related services program.

414
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also a four-week, three-day per week program that ran from July 9th to August 1st.

415
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:48,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The next slide just gives you a breakdown of how many students were enrolled in our specific programs this year, and we go from our connections pre K to five we had.

416
00:37:49,970 --> 00:38:00,397
[SPEAKER_05]: 33 students, we had approximately 89 students that attended for tutoring, and there's a wide range in between for all the different services.

417
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:12,726
[SPEAKER_05]: The related services included speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, vision, hearing, and those services, as well as counseling and social skills groups.

418
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, well not lastly but this is the breakdown of the staffing that is required to run our extended school year program.

419
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:31,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one program supervisor this year, we had approximately 20 teachers that worked to a reading specialists.

420
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We had 34 paraprofessionals who supported the programs, and one was also a paraprofessional supporting a student who attended summer fun.

421
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:52,835
[SPEAKER_05]: We had speech therapists, occupational therapists, we also had an occupational therapy assistant, school adjustment Councilors, nursing, BCBAs, and our vision specialist providing services.

422
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: The success of this program could not run as well as it does every year if it wasn't for the devoted special education staff who commit to working each and every summer.

423
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:11,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't run this program without them.

424
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:15,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to express, if you can go to the next slide, please.

425
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:21,150
[SPEAKER_05]: My sincere appreciation and gratitude to all of the staff who worked this summer.

426
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:25,692
[SPEAKER_05]: A special thanks to Kim Clinton, who's our special education coordinator.

427
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:39,479
[SPEAKER_05]: She was our program supervisor and really led the way in organizing all of the schedules, the hiring, the transportation for this program, as well as all of the special education coordinators and ETLs

428
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: who worked tirelessly from February till June, and the planning and organizing of the extended school year program, scheduling, and collaborating with families and staff throughout the year.

429
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:55,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will continue this program next year.

430
00:39:56,164 --> 00:40:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any questions, I can take them now, or if you wanna wait till the end of the presentation.

431
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you mayor and thank you so much for this presentation.

432
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:11,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a couple of quick questions.

433
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:22,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the first slide about the 251 students that were recommended compared to the 201 that actually attended, was the reduction from the recommendation to the actual because of

434
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,231
[SPEAKER_17]: parental decisions or was it a?

435
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It was based on parental decisions.

436
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:28,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So we planned for the 251.

437
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:34,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Their parents have decided not to have their students participate.

438
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: They go away for the summer months.

439
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Some parents have elected to have their students attend summer fun and not access our extended school year.

440
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:51,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a wide variety, but we send out a survey in February and we send it out several times to see who will be accessing

441
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:57,535
[SPEAKER_05]: The extended school year service, so we plan for that, but last minute changes come about.

442
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also offer transportation so students can access those services.

443
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:03,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

444
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:14,689
[SPEAKER_17]: And then for the dates and times slide, with the six-week, four-week, and various programs, is there a set duration for each program, or is it the same for all of them, and then it's just dependent on the total amount?

445
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:17,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So we look at the recommendations that the team has made.

446
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:27,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So for our connections program, one of our access programs, those are typically our six-week programs, and then everything else falls into the other four-week.

447
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Our four-week, three-day program is typically MEEP,

448
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:34,934
[SPEAKER_05]: a language-based program and our learning group program.

449
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:36,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And then tutoring is always the three days.

450
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:51,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, and then for each student that gets directed towards one program or another, is that based off of the recommendation of the department plus the conjunction with their parental, you know, their custodian, like whoever's working with them day to day in their classroom and their parents?

451
00:41:51,913 --> 00:42:05,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, so these decisions are made within the team meeting, so it could be an annual review or a three-year re-evaluation, and this is one of the components that has to be considered on a yearly basis, so they walk through,

452
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:27,967
[SPEAKER_05]: they look at has the student experienced regression or the inability to recoup skills after say a long vacation or after the winter break, the spring break, so they take some data and that's when the recommendation is made and then based on what the team feels the student requires, then they would offer the six week, the four week, that sort of thing.

453
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

454
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:29,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

455
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:31,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor?

456
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member Ruseau?

457
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:34,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

458
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,056
[SPEAKER_19]: Were you fully staffed?

459
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:37,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we were.

460
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:38,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful news.

461
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:42,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe more so than we needed, but I'd rather be overstaffed.

462
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:46,303
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a problem not many people probably have.

463
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:52,788
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we survey whether people are going to participate, do we ask them why if they say no?

464
00:42:54,163 --> 00:43:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I would have to check the survey to see, but we do reach out to them several times just to confirm, but I can see if there's a reason why and get back to you on that one.

465
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:08,855
[SPEAKER_19]: It just sounds like something that might be interesting just to make sure there's not something that you could do differently that would.

466
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:10,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also do, we try to ask.

467
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:14,898
[SPEAKER_05]: further, is it transportation they required access?

468
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:25,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's also included in that survey, but I can reach out to Kim Clinton to find out if there are any specific reasons and maybe we tweak the survey going forward to get a better understanding of why.

469
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:25,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, yeah.

470
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:26,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

471
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:29,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

472
00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:36,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

473
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:38,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushe.

474
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:51,393
[SPEAKER_16]: The EL Summer Enrichment Program, we have various programs that happen starting in the end of June.

475
00:43:51,514 --> 00:44:01,879
[SPEAKER_16]: It starts with a one-week STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base through STAR Labs, which is a week-long STEM camp for students in fifth and sixth grade.

476
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,102
[SPEAKER_16]: They do robotics, engineering, computer design.

477
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:08,463
[SPEAKER_16]: They build rockets.

478
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,564
[SPEAKER_16]: They get to launch them.

479
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:10,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of fun.

480
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:20,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And after that ends, then we roll into our Summer Enrichment Program, which it's basically K-8.

481
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:24,355
[SPEAKER_16]: K-5 is at the Mississaugas.

482
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Our numbers actually doubled this year.

483
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:31,621
[SPEAKER_16]: We typically have about 45 students in the program during the summer, and this year we had almost 100.

484
00:44:33,823 --> 00:44:48,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Then at the middle school, which we host up at the high school, we run a middle school summer enrichment program, and then we do an add-on program for credit recovery for high school students to get what they need if they fail the class.

485
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:53,858
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a combination of enrichment and credit recovery.

486
00:44:54,698 --> 00:45:01,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we also offer tutoring at the Medford Public Library, and that's for our secondary students.

487
00:45:01,923 --> 00:45:08,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Teachers will do office hours, just one hour, and it fluctuates based on availability.

488
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,827
[SPEAKER_16]: It's mornings and evenings.

489
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:23,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And students who need help with getting their summer reading done, picking out books, any other math or history packets at the secondary level, there's a teacher there to kind of guide them through that through the summer.

490
00:45:24,864 --> 00:45:28,806
[SPEAKER_16]: And those, Dr. Cushing, if you want, I just have pictures of what we did.

491
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:41,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Also at the elementary program, we contracted with High Touch High Tech, which is a science organization that's in Massachusetts and Maine, I think.

492
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:45,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And they come and we get to pick what they're going to do.

493
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I think last year was bridges, beams, and columns.

494
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,800
[SPEAKER_16]: This year they did electricity.

495
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,083
[SPEAKER_16]: They learned how to build circuits.

496
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:58,709
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the scientists come and they rotate through the grades throughout the day.

497
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:01,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushing?

498
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:10,408
[SPEAKER_16]: And then with the elementary program, because this is enrichment and it's paid for out of Title III, we try to plan a field trip every week.

499
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Because of our increased numbers, we actually had to separate out.

500
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:32,576
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of the students got to go to the Franklin Park Zoo, but the Children's Museum and the aquarium, we divided it K to two and three to five to offset the numbers because Title III will pay the admission, the transportation costs, everything for the students for the enrichment program.

501
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:39,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushing, these are just various photos of the field trips that the students went on.

502
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,802
[SPEAKER_16]: And the summer curriculum is tied into what the students are learning.

503
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:50,427
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's an animal component, there's sea life, there's general academics that also happen.

504
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:53,008
[SPEAKER_16]: And then these are photos from Starbase.

505
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:55,850
[SPEAKER_16]: This was actually building bridges.

506
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:03,136
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was CAD design for programming the robots too.

507
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:07,873
[SPEAKER_16]: And then again, as Ms.

508
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:11,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Bowen said, this wouldn't have happened without the support of the teachers.

509
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,478
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the list of all of the teachers.

510
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:15,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I was also fully staffed.

511
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:21,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I was very lucky because of the increased numbers that I managed to get some additional staff to support the program.

512
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:25,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also, a special thanks to Anthony Petrellis because

513
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:37,347
[SPEAKER_16]: What we do is our program ends at noon, but what we've done with him is arranged that we have 30 slots for the after-school program that they can go into summer fun.

514
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:44,529
[SPEAKER_16]: I provide the teachers as an add-on so students can stay and get the full day if they choose.

515
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:57,715
[SPEAKER_06]: You said there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fund, were there people who wanted to do Summer Fund that didn't get to?

516
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:05,337
[SPEAKER_16]: So we took a list, so we send out a separate permission slip after students show up and register, and we keep a separate list.

517
00:48:05,377 --> 00:48:12,679
[SPEAKER_16]: So as students, not every student that signed up could go on to Summer Fund, because we only have the 30 slots, we can't overwhelm the program.

518
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:19,701
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyone that signed up for it, so if a student was absent, we could rotate through, we would call and say, oh,

519
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:27,046
[SPEAKER_16]: child can stay today so almost everybody got you know that wanted to got to experience that at some point.

520
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:31,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember so.

521
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,452
[SPEAKER_19]: The numbers growing so much.

522
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:37,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you talk about.

523
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

524
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:40,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I had an answer.

525
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:46,308
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a surprise when the registration started coming in and we were counting up the numbers and making the class lists.

526
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:50,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, I don't have a reason.

527
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:51,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I guess.

528
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:52,814
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll take it.

529
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:59,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, it gave me, because of the registration, and we'll accept registrations the day of, because again, it's enrichment.

530
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:08,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it allowed us to, you know, give us a little lag time because we had that week off to recruit two more teachers for the program.

531
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:08,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

532
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,791
[SPEAKER_19]: And Title III pays for all of this, you said?

533
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:12,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it all comes out of the Title III grant.

534
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:13,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Fabulous.

535
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:13,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

536
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:17,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Intoppa?

537
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:18,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

538
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,443
[SPEAKER_21]: This probably is an important question.

539
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:22,623
[SPEAKER_21]: This is just me being curious.

540
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:24,925
[SPEAKER_21]: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?

541
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:26,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Are they teaching them SOLIDWORKS?

542
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:28,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no idea what the name of the program is.

543
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:31,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.

544
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:39,373
[SPEAKER_21]: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like, it might not be, but it looks just like that program.

545
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:41,914
[SPEAKER_21]: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.

546
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:42,575
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to.

547
00:49:43,215 --> 00:49:44,936
[SPEAKER_16]: So like I said, they were building bridges.

548
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:47,938
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if that's what that program would be for.

549
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:54,043
[SPEAKER_16]: But then the other program in the other picture was coding.

550
00:49:54,183 --> 00:49:57,565
[SPEAKER_16]: So they could actually program their robots to follow a track.

551
00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:00,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the robots fight with the robot wars.

552
00:50:01,027 --> 00:50:01,728
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.

553
00:50:01,908 --> 00:50:03,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I had that when I was a kid.

554
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:04,870
[SPEAKER_21]: That's crazy.

555
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,631
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a little more than just one week.

556
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,513
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only time you can get.

557
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:10,374
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to take that.

558
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:10,874
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

559
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:11,915
[SPEAKER_21]: My mic is echoing.

560
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:13,650
[SPEAKER_21]: everywhere.

561
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll speak softer.

562
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:18,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to echo how great that is.

563
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:25,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Because again, this is the time to learn these programs and it'll excel the future through that.

564
00:50:25,993 --> 00:50:28,854
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to send my regards.

565
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:29,614
[SPEAKER_21]: It's awesome.

566
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:30,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

567
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:33,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

568
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:34,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

569
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:48,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the high school, we offered fifth quarter, formerly known as our credit recovery program.

570
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:54,785
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can, oh, I'm sorry.

571
00:50:55,125 --> 00:51:01,689
[SPEAKER_10]: It was led by Riley Jones, who was the director of the summer school program, who's also a teacher at the high school.

572
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:06,292
[SPEAKER_10]: We offered it to both middle and high school students over the summer.

573
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:12,313
[SPEAKER_10]: To start, we set learning expectations and objectives for both students and for teachers.

574
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:32,237
[SPEAKER_10]: For teachers, teachers provided instruction through the standards for the content area along with providing competency-based exams and assessments because it was over a short amount of time for the year that the students were engaged in the work throughout the year.

575
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:39,845
[SPEAKER_10]: We offered 30 days of instruction, so the program ran from the end of the school year to the first week of August.

576
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:43,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We offered middle school courses and high school courses.

577
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:54,542
[SPEAKER_10]: For middle school, ELA and math were identified as content areas for summer school, along with high school courses that spanned between English, math, science, and history.

578
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:04,761
[SPEAKER_10]: For the middle school numbers, we had 23 students enrolled in math, 17 students passed, 74% pass rate.

579
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:12,787
[SPEAKER_10]: For ELA, we had 19 students enrolled, 16 student passed, and 84% with an 84% pass rate.

580
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:24,577
[SPEAKER_10]: For the high school, we had, for our math programs, integrated math, geometry, and algebra two, we had between a 94% pass rate to 100% pass rate.

581
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: For the English and Humanities, we had an English course and a world slash US history course that we offered.

582
00:52:35,794 --> 00:52:38,116
[SPEAKER_10]: 26 were in the English, 85% pass rate.

583
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:40,718
[SPEAKER_10]: History, 19 students were enrolled and 79% pass rate.

584
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:50,040
[SPEAKER_10]: For the sciences, we had 18 students.

585
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,282
[SPEAKER_10]: That was our bigger number of science students.

586
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:59,731
[SPEAKER_10]: In biology, which is grade nine, 18 students enrolled, 16 students passed with an 89% pass rate.

587
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:05,037
[SPEAKER_10]: For chemistry, we had 100% pass rate for the five students that were enrolled in that program.

588
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:20,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give a special thanks to all of the teachers that were there every single day over five weeks span, along with Riley Jones, who oversaw the program, and then the administration that was there for support when needed.

589
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:34,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?

590
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:35,680
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens next for them?

591
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so for the students that did not pass, it was primarily based on attendance.

592
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:45,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So they missed so many days and they weren't able to recover the credit.

593
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:52,613
[SPEAKER_10]: They are working with their school Councilors now as to how we can recover those credits in order for them to graduate with their cohort on time.

594
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:56,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you very much.

595
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:58,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, member of the Paddy.

596
00:53:58,393 --> 00:53:58,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

597
00:53:59,174 --> 00:54:01,435
[SPEAKER_17]: A question about the students that are entered into this program.

598
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:17,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a process in which we work with them going to the next school year about how to, you know, either be more consistent with attendance or about how to kind of work with your teachers after school about making sure that they're not in danger of falling behind their credits just so that, you know, understandably that these students were struggling to begin with.

599
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:22,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there ways for us to kind of continue to support them going forward that they might not have had previously?

600
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:36,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so we are taking a deep dive in the data from our Saturday Academy that we had running throughout the school year to the students that are enrolled in summer school and how can we best support them throughout the whole entire school year starting from day one.

601
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:46,874
[SPEAKER_10]: We are working with the school counseling department who are now going to be pushing into classes and providing workshops, especially for grade nine and 10.

602
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:51,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We're finding they need a lot more executive functioning, planning and supports.

603
00:54:52,676 --> 00:54:55,398
[SPEAKER_10]: and then as well as tracking these students.

604
00:54:55,438 --> 00:55:14,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So for like the students that were already, for example, ninth and 10th grade primarily that have engaged in our fifth quarter this year, how do we make sure that they're not on track for that starting this week so that they're not constantly trying to catch up and they're at a deficit?

605
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:15,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

606
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:25,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

607
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:43,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So in June, I'm sorry, I'm just going to advance my... In June, I came with Dr. Chiesa and we presented that we got a vacation grant through the Department of Education to focus on literacy acceleration for our students.

608
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: This spanned Medford public school students from

609
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:51,815
[SPEAKER_09]: grades one to grade nine.

610
00:55:53,017 --> 00:56:00,329
[SPEAKER_09]: The focus of this was on literacy and grade level skills and easing the transition to the next grade level.

611
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:04,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to the next slide, please.

612
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:17,770
[SPEAKER_09]: This was already presented in June, but as a reminder, students in the Acceleration Academy, they were selected by invitation based on district-wide data.

613
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:26,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the elementary level for students in grades one through three, that was primarily DIBLS data with some of the MAP data.

614
00:56:27,356 --> 00:56:29,397
[SPEAKER_09]: For students in grades four and five,

615
00:56:29,817 --> 00:56:33,683
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a combination of DIBLS data, MAP data, and MCAS data.

616
00:56:34,364 --> 00:56:44,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And for rising 6th graders and 9th graders, again, some of those students had DIBLS data as well as MAP growth and MCAS data.

617
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:56,300
[SPEAKER_09]: This acceleration program was a full day program that took place at the McGlynn School for one week, the week of July 29th.

618
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Free breakfast and lunch was provided.

619
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:11,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It was structured somewhat typical to a regular school day so that students were able to engage in core literacy instruction as well as enrichment activities.

620
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:15,845
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a physical education teacher on staff and an art teacher on staff.

621
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:25,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Each classroom, so the way the grant was set up was that it really was structured for small group targeted tiered instruction.

622
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:34,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we made sure that we structured that format so that within each grade level span, we had multiple teachers in a classroom.

623
00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So each grade more, more in the younger grades and a little bit less as they progressed.

624
00:57:41,268 --> 00:57:50,076
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had about two to three teachers in each classroom so that we were able to target very specifically that small group instruction.

625
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:56,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that in those grades, there was a content teacher or a classroom teacher and a reading specialist.

626
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:13,111
[SPEAKER_09]: We had, for the span, about 55 students in grades one through three, 16 students in grades four through five, and 15 students in rising grades six through nine.

627
00:58:15,032 --> 00:58:21,698
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the grant program, Dr. Chiesa sent a letter

628
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:32,602
[SPEAKER_09]: two surveys, one to the teachers, the participating teachers in the program, and another one to caregivers to elicit some feedback on how the program went.

629
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:50,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers, we got a lot of positive feedback from teachers in terms of the format that we had for that small group instruction, that they were able to work collaboratively and really target the instruction and each kind of own some of that reading instruction.

630
00:58:50,748 --> 00:58:57,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were some future recommendations to have the program start a little closer to when school gets out.

631
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:12,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the feedback was that it needs to be a longer program, that one week was not enough, which we have been in active conversations about how we can increase this opportunity beyond DESE funding through a grant.

632
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:16,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the positives from teachers, they really enjoyed that daily schedule.

633
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:20,155
[SPEAKER_09]: They liked having co-teachers to facilitate with.

634
00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:23,216
[SPEAKER_09]: and they loved the small group instruction.

635
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:35,659
[SPEAKER_09]: The feedback from caregivers, 100% of caregivers said that they would love to have their students participate in this program again.

636
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:37,820
[SPEAKER_09]: They thought it was very beneficial.

637
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,001
[SPEAKER_09]: They appreciated the ongoing communication.

638
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: They wished that it was a little bit longer or that there was some extended opportunities for extended care.

639
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:57,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And the location, we were very mindful to have this housed at the McGlynn School for several reasons.

640
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:04,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Transportation was not part of this opportunity that we gave to our families.

641
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:10,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the students that were invited, a lot of them primarily lived in that area.

642
01:00:10,923 --> 01:00:15,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we wanted to make sure that we were bringing the program to the students that needed it the most.

643
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:26,874
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, that because our program spanned from grades one to nine or high school, the McGlynn lent itself nicely to the space and the air conditioning.

644
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: The next slide just shows a few pictures, not many, but just you can see the small group instruction, elementary on the outer and the sixth and ninth grade in the middle.

645
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:43,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And again,

646
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:49,074
[SPEAKER_09]: This would not be possible without the teachers and the people heavily involved in this program.

647
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:53,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Keyes, the humanities director, was this program's facilitator.

648
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:55,896
[SPEAKER_09]: She did a phenomenal job.

649
01:00:55,936 --> 01:01:10,280
[SPEAKER_09]: She worked very closely with our literacy coach, Kristen Howell, and then all of the teachers ranging from grade one to grade nine with our two specialists, as well as nursing coverage.

650
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:15,880
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any questions about this opportunity before I move on to... Mayor.

651
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, then Member Reinfeld.

652
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:21,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

653
01:01:22,302 --> 01:01:29,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed the comment in the teacher feedback that four days was fun, but the two weeks we did before was great.

654
01:01:30,205 --> 01:01:32,006
[SPEAKER_19]: What is this two weeks we did before?

655
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:37,548
[SPEAKER_09]: We've offered a couple opportunities for extended time in the summer.

656
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,757
[SPEAKER_09]: and we've had a couple different formats that we've used.

657
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:46,642
[SPEAKER_09]: One year, last year or the year before, we've done two week half day program.

658
01:01:47,322 --> 01:01:51,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's pros and cons to each format that you provide.

659
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:53,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But for working parents,

660
01:01:54,163 --> 01:02:00,227
[SPEAKER_09]: half day is also quite difficult to drop students off and pick them up when we don't have transportation.

661
01:02:01,228 --> 01:02:03,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So we could have done the half day program.

662
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:18,320
[SPEAKER_09]: That was not a requirement per DESE, but we felt very strongly about offering a full day program for working parents and also offering students the opportunity to have two meals and some enrichment with the specialists.

663
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:20,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's,

664
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:31,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that outweighs a little bit of, I would like to see it be longer than one week, but I think that the full day programming is important for a lot of our families.

665
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:39,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, and so Desi's paying for the meals and the time and the school and all that stuff, right?

666
01:02:41,351 --> 01:02:43,972
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're not covering transportation.

667
01:02:44,913 --> 01:02:47,254
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that, you know,

668
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:53,998
[SPEAKER_19]: that doesn't mean that we couldn't, I mean, we don't have lots of money laying around, but that doesn't mean we couldn't do it.

669
01:02:55,278 --> 01:03:03,340
[SPEAKER_19]: And so when the invitations go out, I'm assuming there's lots of people who do not accept the invitation.

670
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we asking them why?

671
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,681
[SPEAKER_19]: And is that useful information for planning in the future?

672
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We did do that.

673
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:16,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a lot of the names that were listed on there

674
01:03:17,185 --> 01:03:19,746
[SPEAKER_09]: did a lot of correspondence and outreach to families.

675
01:03:20,766 --> 01:03:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And in our survey, we had that question as well.

676
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:30,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the double-edged sword here is that we are very appreciative to the Department of Education for their grant.

677
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,211
[SPEAKER_09]: But the timing of it was

678
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:42,516
[SPEAKER_09]: late and so we did hear from some families that they had vacations or they were already enrolled in other camps.

679
01:03:42,916 --> 01:04:01,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have a few situations in where a student may have attended, may have missed half of the day because they had something else and we just were very flexible because the timing of the invitation was a little later in the year and if we were planning

680
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:06,499
[SPEAKER_09]: would have been more beneficial to have that at an earlier date.

681
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,663
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're saying Gessie didn't even come out with the grant early enough.

682
01:04:14,105 --> 01:04:15,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a later grant.

683
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:16,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I know.

684
01:04:17,448 --> 01:04:24,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a later grant, and then you apply, but you also have to wait for the response to see if you've been awarded the grant.

685
01:04:24,754 --> 01:04:25,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it, thank you.

686
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

687
01:04:29,471 --> 01:04:30,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of work.

688
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.

689
01:04:42,723 --> 01:04:44,924
[SPEAKER_06]: This was, remind me of the scope.

690
01:04:45,224 --> 01:04:46,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, for the grant?

691
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:46,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

692
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,965
[SPEAKER_09]: It was literally titled a vacation grant.

693
01:04:50,205 --> 01:04:56,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was, the intention of the grant was for vacation weeks or summer.

694
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,567
[SPEAKER_09]: But for one year, or one year program.

695
01:04:58,587 --> 01:04:58,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

696
01:04:58,747 --> 01:05:00,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's, all right.

697
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:04,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember Ruseau touched on this, what was the percentage of students who accepted?

698
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:08,834
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.

699
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:10,275
[SPEAKER_09]: We did, we did.

700
01:05:10,395 --> 01:05:14,697
[SPEAKER_09]: So we actually, I can get you the exact number in terms of like a percentile.

701
01:05:17,078 --> 01:05:22,320
[SPEAKER_09]: For the students that we invited, we were quite successful in that, in the students participating.

702
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,242
[SPEAKER_09]: We only, because we did have a tiered approach in terms of the students that we were inviting.

703
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So we only had to go to that next tier just a few times.

704
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:35,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for me, if I'm looking back at it,

705
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:41,514
[SPEAKER_09]: the pieces where there was more of that work to do was as we progress in the grades.

706
01:05:42,203 --> 01:05:59,456
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we had a lot, I don't think we had to really go much further for students in the lower grades, grades one through three, but for students in the rising grades four to rising grade nine, that took a little bit more correspondence.

707
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:10,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early dibbles, early map, or even qualitative?

708
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:17,037
[SPEAKER_09]: We do, and actually, so this week started both our DIBLS assessments and our math.

709
01:06:17,217 --> 01:06:17,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure did.

710
01:06:18,658 --> 01:06:19,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And our math assessments.

711
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will have a lot of that preliminary data.

712
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:35,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I think maybe the other piece to an opportunity like this where it was just one week, even per DIBLS, if we're using that as our benchmark for progress monitoring,

713
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:42,992
[SPEAKER_09]: they suggest, especially for struggling readers, that we're not assessing until after 10 days of instruction.

714
01:06:43,652 --> 01:06:49,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So we would have to be, a lot of what we would have to be using is this current benchmark at the beginning of the year.

715
01:06:49,333 --> 01:07:01,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated, and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.

716
01:07:02,077 --> 01:07:02,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

717
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:08,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.

718
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:21,008
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with

719
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Hill and others.

720
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you asked that question.

721
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to answer it twofold.

722
01:07:27,496 --> 01:07:38,047
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I would like to say that even some of the teacher feedback from our secondary staff that also worked the fifth quarter, some of that was also

723
01:07:38,747 --> 01:07:52,133
[SPEAKER_09]: in conversations that I've had with Riley Jones and with Principal Cabral, there was a lot of interest to use that model and bring it over to the fifth quarter, especially for middle school students.

724
01:07:52,593 --> 01:08:03,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that we're working on in terms of like the difference that we kind of saw in some of the data between middle school students that participated in fifth quarter and high school students that participated in fifth quarter.

725
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:06,459
[SPEAKER_09]: But also too, where this is our new,

726
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:11,503
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our second year in the literacy program.

727
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:25,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And so literacy programs are so massive that we spent every last minute of our PD time last year on literacy and this program, and we still didn't cover it all.

728
01:08:26,554 --> 01:08:36,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a lot of the focus this year is definitely with Hill and with our school leaders is definitely on that small group instruction, so much so that

729
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:45,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the summer, we used teachers from the district literacy leadership team, as well as school leaders.

730
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:48,894
[SPEAKER_09]: We met in June to really look at our elementary schedule and

731
01:08:51,419 --> 01:09:16,219
[SPEAKER_09]: the teachers worked with their principals over the summer and we were able to not only align the elementary schedules across the district, but our real primary focus was on that literacy block and ensuring that our students are present for tier one instruction and not forced to have to be removed from the classroom for their services.

732
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:20,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were able to really look at our literacy blocks

733
01:09:21,343 --> 01:09:26,487
[SPEAKER_09]: K to five and ensure separate times so that students have that tier one instruction.

734
01:09:26,548 --> 01:09:33,253
[SPEAKER_09]: They're part of that small group instruction and that services are provided at different opportunities.

735
01:09:33,293 --> 01:09:34,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So students aren't

736
01:09:34,618 --> 01:09:35,779
[SPEAKER_09]: sacrificing any of that.

737
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a very big focus of the literacy instruction this year is that small group instruction.

738
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:55,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when Hill comes around this year, our focus with Hill this year is on, they're gonna be coming into the schools once a month, each building, and they're going to be working on that piece of the implementation of the program.

739
01:09:56,328 --> 01:10:03,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of that is going to be focused on the ECRI, the small group instruction, and as well as the tier one whole group time.

740
01:10:04,778 --> 01:10:07,339
[SPEAKER_09]: does it affect the tier two model as well?

741
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,180
[SPEAKER_09]: The coaching or the schedule?

742
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess both.

743
01:10:14,801 --> 01:10:30,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we were finding, and the reason that really precipitated having this summer work, is that we have a lot of students, and especially in our title one buildings of the McGlynn and the Missituk, there's a lot of students that are duly identified

744
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:36,027
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe Tripoli identified, and they need to have multiple services.

745
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:46,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be special education, EL, related services, and too often students were missing that tier one time with their peers.

746
01:10:46,915 --> 01:10:48,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we wanted to

747
01:10:49,049 --> 01:11:01,797
[SPEAKER_09]: make that sacred so that students are learning alongside with their peers, they have time with their teacher in small group instruction, as well as having to leave the room for small group instruction.

748
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:13,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we were able to, the elementary principals with myself and Dr. Kieser and the literacy coaches and the teachers on the DLLT, the district leadership team,

749
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: worked on this all summer, we were able to create more aligned schedules to meet those needs.

750
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

751
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:26,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

752
01:11:27,045 --> 01:11:28,547
[SPEAKER_11]: How much was the grant from DESE?

753
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:31,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Roughly.

754
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:35,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to misquote.

755
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Dr. Keyes on the call?

756
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:38,817
[SPEAKER_15]: I am.

757
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:43,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm gonna toss this to you, Dr. Keyes.

758
01:11:43,437 --> 01:11:45,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, it was approximately 40 grand.

759
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:49,560
[SPEAKER_15]: It just varied based on how many student participants.

760
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,701
[SPEAKER_15]: It was around that amount.

761
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:53,863
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get you the final amount, but that was the general timeframe.

762
01:11:53,883 --> 01:11:57,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, general amount.

763
01:11:57,265 --> 01:11:57,205
40, 40.

764
01:11:57,485 --> 01:11:58,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay, thank you.

765
01:11:58,866 --> 01:11:59,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for that.

766
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:05,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've done this before, and how did we pay for it in the past?

767
01:12:06,442 --> 01:12:12,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So that we've had, before we did get a DESE grant, but we've also used ESSER.

768
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:12,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

769
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:19,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And is it a grant that comes around every year or not necessarily?

770
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:20,995
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our fingers crossed.

771
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:21,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

772
01:12:23,197 --> 01:12:23,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

773
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:31,925
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would like to be, I would like to, in conversations with Dr. Chiesa and the literacy coaches,

774
01:12:33,068 --> 01:12:37,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we would also like to see if there's other ways to fund the expansion.

775
01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:51,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Because even if this comes up again, if we were to offer it with the same format and at the same level of staffing, we would need to supplement that to expand it beyond that one week.

776
01:12:51,532 --> 01:12:54,013
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

777
01:12:54,173 --> 01:12:59,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just helpful to know as we ultimately think about the budget and what needs to go in the budget

778
01:13:00,845 --> 01:13:09,213
[SPEAKER_11]: particularly because planning for this, if we're doing it in advance, is gonna precede any sort of budget hearings and approvals and all that.

779
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:18,182
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you're ready to present a proposal, please do, so that we can figure out how to handle that proactively.

780
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:18,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

781
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:19,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

782
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:24,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

783
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:32,453
[SPEAKER_09]: So Director Fee, moving on to the last part of this presentation, and I am saddened she couldn't be here.

784
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:36,616
[SPEAKER_09]: She's very dedicated and has done such a fabulous job.

785
01:13:37,276 --> 01:13:51,886
[SPEAKER_09]: She did not have a summer because Director Fee has spent the summer securing our brand new band director, who's fabulous, Michael Dampier, and making sure that these programs went off without a hitch.

786
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:57,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So started during COVID was the Jumpstart Music Program to try to re-energize.

787
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That has now become an annual staple.

788
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:03,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the Jumpstart Music Program was very successful.

789
01:14:03,634 --> 01:14:17,343
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a two-week program for rising students in grades four through eight as a way to either continue their music instruction, or if they were interested in chatting with friends, get them involved.

790
01:14:17,363 --> 01:14:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: There were over 80 students that participated in the Jumpstart Music Program.

791
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:35,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Our brand new band director and music teacher, Michael Dampier, was there as well as Emma Baptist, Sophia Chang, and we even had high school students that were volunteering and helping with the younger students.

792
01:14:36,858 --> 01:14:38,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very important to note that

793
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:48,041
[SPEAKER_09]: There were various string and percussion instruments that were given to students free of charge so that they could participate in this program.

794
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:51,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Although some families did opt to purchase the programs.

795
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:53,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It was up to the family.

796
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:59,406
[SPEAKER_09]: For the first time this year as part of Jump Start Music, we were able to include a color guard section.

797
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:04,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were students in rising, I believe they were rising fifth and sixth graders.

798
01:15:06,529 --> 01:15:09,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had, excuse me?

799
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there were, okay, thank you for that.

800
01:15:13,393 --> 01:15:14,434
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was wonderful.

801
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:28,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end of the program, they did, on the final day, they did do a performance so that the orchestra and the band and the color guard gave a wonderful performance to caregivers and other people that were working up at the high school that day.

802
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wonderful addition.

803
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:36,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's important to note that a lot of

804
01:15:37,843 --> 01:15:41,647
[SPEAKER_09]: The coordination was also with the band parent organization.

805
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:47,674
[SPEAKER_09]: They've worked tirelessly this summer and very closely with Director Fee and Medford Public Schools.

806
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:49,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're very appreciative of them.

807
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:53,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were able to also secure a Tufts grant to help with that.

808
01:15:54,498 --> 01:16:00,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for the first time, Director Fee also had a summer art program.

809
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:11,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this was free of charge for this first annual year, and it was funded by the Medford Arts Council, the Cummings Foundation, and the City of Medford Community Fund.

810
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:16,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pilot program, but it was very, very successful.

811
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:31,112
[SPEAKER_09]: High school students, there were about 12 students that participated at the high school level, and they did a studio week on self-directed projects, and everything was connected to social issues that were important to the students.

812
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:37,517
[SPEAKER_09]: They created ceramic pieces, cardboard sculptures, paintings, drawings, and more.

813
01:16:38,338 --> 01:16:42,521
[SPEAKER_09]: For students in grades four through eight, there were 30 students that participated.

814
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:52,088
[SPEAKER_09]: They learned and practiced different skills and techniques and applied them to personal projects that reflected a social issue of their choice.

815
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for students in grades one through three, approximately 25 students participated there.

816
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:06,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And they spent the week using, just exploring different art materials and learning around the themes of kindness.

817
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:15,889
[SPEAKER_09]: You will see on this last slide, there's just a few pictures that Director Fee included from the workshop.

818
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:30,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, as with all programming this summer, would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of teachers and community.

819
01:17:31,637 --> 01:17:33,798
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had community members helping as well.

820
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, if you have any questions, I can attempt.

821
01:17:40,855 --> 01:17:43,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for doing a great job with Ms.

822
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Fee's presentation, and thank you to Ms.

823
01:17:44,838 --> 01:17:45,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Fee for all the hard work.

824
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:46,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

825
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:53,285
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to thank all of the staff and teachers that have spent their whole summer doing all this stuff.

826
01:17:53,665 --> 01:17:57,168
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of this stuff happened in places that weren't the coolest facilities either.

827
01:17:57,188 --> 01:18:02,172
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, it's one thing to spend your summer working with kids,

828
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:06,232
[SPEAKER_19]: It's another to do it when it's too damn hot in the buildings.

829
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:14,876
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you to all of the, too many people to list, but thank you to all of this wonderful staff and the administration for making it happen too.

830
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:16,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

831
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:25,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think it's important with all that programming, if you added up all of the staff and the educators that participated to make this possible for students, it's a lot.

832
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:28,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're greatly appreciative of that.

833
01:18:29,442 --> 01:18:30,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, yes, thank you.

834
01:18:30,262 --> 01:18:30,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

835
01:18:30,723 --> 01:18:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to go far.

836
01:18:31,603 --> 01:18:35,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the next step, you're getting to report on personnel and enrollment.

837
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Kozy.

838
01:18:39,146 --> 01:18:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

839
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:43,668
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

840
01:18:44,008 --> 01:18:45,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing is just going to present.

841
01:18:45,709 --> 01:18:54,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you had in your packets just a basic overview of the enrollment so far for Metro Public Schools.

842
01:18:56,805 --> 01:19:06,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you've probably heard this before, but I just have to reiterate how fluid of a situation enrollment and personnel is at this time of year.

843
01:19:10,307 --> 01:19:14,568
[SPEAKER_09]: are reporting to DESE is always the first, October 1st.

844
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:19,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's a lot that's happening between now and October 1st.

845
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:23,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So much so that even the, Dr. Cushing, you may go to the next slide.

846
01:19:24,252 --> 01:19:31,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe in your packets on Friday, you received this as an overall enrollment view.

847
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:37,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one of the things that I just want to explain is it's a slightly different format than what you're used to seeing.

848
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Our data analyst, Kim Miles, works tirelessly, always, but especially this time of year, constantly updating this for us.

849
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:51,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one of the things you'll see in the far right is something that's called TBD.

850
01:19:53,608 --> 01:19:55,729
[SPEAKER_09]: and it doesn't reflect a specific school.

851
01:19:55,849 --> 01:20:03,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what happens at this time of year is that there's a lot of students whose registrations are not complete, and that's for various reasons.

852
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:09,817
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they may not have been assigned to a school yet, which is why things are constantly changing.

853
01:20:10,817 --> 01:20:14,920
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be for, it could be medically pending, and it's with, you know,

854
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:39,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Nurse Director Jen Silva, it could be EL, and there may be some testing with Director Paul Teixeira's department, or it just may be that they have not followed back up and have chosen not to come to Medford Public Schools, or there may be another registration hang-up in which the registration office is following up with phone calls

855
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:41,544
[SPEAKER_09]: to try and assist and see what's going on.

856
01:20:42,064 --> 01:20:57,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So over the weekend, if you just advance please Dr. Cushing to the next slide, Kim Miles had sent this because again, over the weekend she was working on cleaning up some of the information and so this was of yesterday.

857
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:00,796
[SPEAKER_09]: and this is the most current information that we have.

858
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:18,590
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see a shift in the total enrollment because she was cleaning out and making sure that it was accurate in terms of students that have moved on or decided, oh, I'm terribly sorry.

859
01:21:20,952 --> 01:21:26,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is a more current view of the enrollment right now for the district.

860
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:31,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite, yeah, do you have any questions before I move to personnel?

861
01:21:32,612 --> 01:21:32,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor?

862
01:21:33,252 --> 01:21:34,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Is she over there?

863
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:34,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

864
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:36,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

865
01:21:36,754 --> 01:21:44,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Just, could you just send Line CC to the school committee when the October 1 report goes to DESE?

866
01:21:45,036 --> 01:21:55,900
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's not gonna look terribly different, but it's good to have, you know, I keep these reports, but I also know that there are so many of these reports that they're not the important reports, so.

867
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,501
[SPEAKER_09]: It's preliminary right now, correct?

868
01:21:58,581 --> 01:21:58,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

869
01:22:04,331 --> 01:22:04,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Olapade.

870
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:06,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

871
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:20,794
[SPEAKER_17]: For the high school enrollment data, is it possible for us, it doesn't have to be obviously right this moment, but could we have the Medford High block separated to the Medford High plus the vocational program just so that we understand how those numbers are changing for the current time?

872
01:22:20,814 --> 01:22:22,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that possible?

873
01:22:22,614 --> 01:22:23,674
[SPEAKER_09]: That is possible, yes.

874
01:22:24,514 --> 01:22:24,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

875
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:26,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

876
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:27,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member Brinley.

877
01:22:28,055 --> 01:22:28,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

878
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:31,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get a regular update on enrollment?

879
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:33,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Monthly, quarterly?

880
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,266
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere just to see how our numbers are staying.

881
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:38,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, just in this report.

882
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:47,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure, just a little bit regularly just so you know, even if it was like January 1st or come the spring just to see where we stand.

883
01:22:47,456 --> 01:22:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just I don't know if it's the time for that, but just curious with, you know, cuts that we made and budget issues, you know, are we being supported properly?

884
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nurse guidance, all the things that we worried about back in May and June, some of those things haven't changed.

885
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:05,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So that concerns me with some of the numbers.

886
01:23:05,299 --> 01:23:06,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that we're

887
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:08,109
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're supposed to be.

888
01:23:09,577 --> 01:23:09,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

889
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:10,561
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

890
01:23:12,472 --> 01:23:13,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Graham.

891
01:23:14,253 --> 01:23:21,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the other thing that's important to call out here is the huge disparity in enrollment at our elementary schools.

892
01:23:24,196 --> 01:23:27,037
[SPEAKER_11]: In my mind, it was always like about 100 kids different.

893
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:34,380
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's like pushing 200 students different between the Roberts and the Missituk.

894
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost 150 between Brooks and Missituk.

895
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:41,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to point that out

896
01:23:43,589 --> 01:23:51,616
[SPEAKER_11]: to do a couple of things, but one is to put on our radar collectively that the gap can't keep widening.

897
01:23:51,676 --> 01:23:53,478
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to do something.

898
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,300
[SPEAKER_11]: different than we're doing today.

899
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've talked to people about this a lot.

900
01:23:59,721 --> 01:24:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not an easy, obvious answer short of like picking a bunch of kids up who live at the McGlynn, basically, and sending them to the Missittuck or picking a bunch of kids up that live next door to the Brooks and sending them to Missittuck.

901
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:22,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So because of the sort of placement of the Missittuck building in the city, there's sort of less that you can draw from to add to those numbers.

902
01:24:22,847 --> 01:24:24,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's a huge challenge, but

903
01:24:24,988 --> 01:24:29,414
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think we can continue to operate in this fashion.

904
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:30,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to do something.

905
01:24:32,478 --> 01:24:36,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I can respond after you comment.

906
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:40,430
[SPEAKER_09]: that I would 100% agree.

907
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:44,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had several conversations with Principal Kroll.

908
01:24:44,693 --> 01:24:47,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if she wants to come up here.

909
01:24:49,055 --> 01:25:01,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the conversations we've had, because again, Roberts is the only school where we had to add yet another fifth section for kindergarten, and their numbers are at 100.

910
01:25:04,453 --> 01:25:08,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Within her schedule, so like the specialist schedules, students go for their specials.

911
01:25:09,914 --> 01:25:14,075
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no more space in her schedule.

912
01:25:14,315 --> 01:25:23,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say if we had an influx and we had to add another section somewhere in her school, there's no more room within the existing schedule.

913
01:25:24,016 --> 01:25:32,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is a big issue that we definitely have to address quite quickly.

914
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:37,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

915
01:25:38,658 --> 01:25:51,081
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm putting it on my list for the budget season because, you know, options are the ever nightmarish redistricting, which is not a permanent solution.

916
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:59,342
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sort of like, in my mind, it's like a 10-year solution because people who think that they need to go to a specific school will simply buy a house in that district.

917
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:03,223
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be a painful experience for people who bought a house

918
01:26:04,682 --> 01:26:11,984
[SPEAKER_19]: near a specific school, knowing that that's where their kid was gonna go, and then they go to register and they find out that's not where their kid's gonna go.

919
01:26:13,165 --> 01:26:24,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, every district that has ever redistricted, it's not a good experience for the process, but it's necessary.

920
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:32,491
[SPEAKER_19]: In my time on the school committee, we have moved programs all over the city because for one reason only,

921
01:26:33,518 --> 01:26:36,299
[SPEAKER_19]: The Roberts was too full or the Brooks was too full.

922
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,801
[SPEAKER_19]: We were never doing it because it was right for kids.

923
01:26:40,181 --> 01:26:42,643
[SPEAKER_19]: It was always, we were just too full.

924
01:26:43,223 --> 01:26:46,444
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, some kids ended up on buses.

925
01:26:47,025 --> 01:26:49,146
[SPEAKER_19]: The newcomers program has been all over the place.

926
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:49,226
[SPEAKER_19]: And

927
01:26:52,406 --> 01:27:03,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Making decisions that are right for the kids should be how we're approaching these things, but that does also mean we're going to have to all experience some pain in redistricting, if that's what we decide to do.

928
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:14,918
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm adding it to my list, my short list of things for us to consider budgeting for in the upcoming year, because it isn't like we just get a map out and just start drawing.

929
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:21,542
[SPEAKER_19]: You hire a company, a consultant who specializes, there are consultants that specialize in exactly this thing.

930
01:27:22,102 --> 01:27:30,428
[SPEAKER_19]: and they figure out things like what happens to busing, and you draw the line here, and there's these three new babies that were born this week on that street.

931
01:27:30,668 --> 01:27:32,089
[SPEAKER_19]: They do all that hard work.

932
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:41,676
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're long past the need to do that because we have to do what's right for kids.

933
01:27:43,037 --> 01:27:45,079
[SPEAKER_19]: If the Roberts is literally

934
01:27:46,823 --> 01:27:59,334
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the scenario of a bunch of new people just move in to that district, we're in bad, bad situation in that case.

935
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:06,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if we decide those new kids have to go to another school, well, they might live right beside the Roberts.

936
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:13,506
[SPEAKER_19]: And meanwhile, people who are really far from the Roberts, right at the edge, they're getting bused to the Roberts.

937
01:28:15,271 --> 01:28:24,440
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not tenable to just avoid this very challenging and politically very unfun experience because, as you said, we're maxed out.

938
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:28,283
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are other things.

939
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:34,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that I don't think the principals all do great jobs, but we have principals making about the same amount of money.

940
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:35,150
[SPEAKER_19]: One has 177 more students, too.

941
01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:38,272
[SPEAKER_19]: to manage.

942
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:41,233
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think they should get paid differently.

943
01:28:41,253 --> 01:28:42,874
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we should resolve that problem.

944
01:28:43,034 --> 01:28:49,456
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess we'll be talking about that more soon because we can't keep going.

945
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:50,216
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

946
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:51,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

947
01:28:51,217 --> 01:28:54,778
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

948
01:28:54,838 --> 01:28:59,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So lastly, I'm just going to give a very broad overview of personnel.

949
01:29:01,467 --> 01:29:05,130
[SPEAKER_09]: To date, we've hired, again, this is also fluid.

950
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:15,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have had people resign or retire as early as this week or last week.

951
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:18,259
[SPEAKER_09]: But in total, we have hired around 44-ish teachers.

952
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:23,966
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a new literacy coach.

953
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:29,388
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have two new literacy coaches, but one was part of the resignation.

954
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:38,192
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've had new literacy coaches, adjustment Councilors, behavior therapists, educational team leaders, a new carpentry teacher.

955
01:29:39,193 --> 01:29:45,696
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a new nurse to help with the Brooks and the Andrews school communities.

956
01:29:46,456 --> 01:29:54,699
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an engagement specialist for Medford Public Schools, who just started today, which is wonderful, and a new payroll manager.

957
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, in total, we have about nine new paraprofessionals.

958
01:30:00,922 --> 01:30:04,883
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are still some vacancies in areas in where we are hiring.

959
01:30:04,903 --> 01:30:06,504
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still about

960
01:30:07,424 --> 01:30:30,769
[SPEAKER_09]: and I use that about 20 open teaching positions, but please note that those range from specialized instruction to long-term substitute needs, because we do have staff that have reasons for absences that we have to cover with long-term solutions.

961
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:36,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And we still have about, I think, just three paraprofessional positions to fill.

962
01:30:39,758 --> 01:30:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have any questions broadly about personnel.

963
01:30:44,302 --> 01:30:44,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley.

964
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:46,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we just have a copy of that?

965
01:30:46,203 --> 01:30:49,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not in our packet, those two pages with the personnel, thank you.

966
01:30:49,246 --> 01:30:54,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I think was, no, it's in the drive, but I'll make up, I can do a print copy.

967
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:55,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, yes.

968
01:30:57,032 --> 01:30:58,293
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you very much.

969
01:30:58,753 --> 01:30:59,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

970
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:01,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor.

971
01:31:02,096 --> 01:31:02,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau.

972
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:05,578
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that there's some members of the public who wanna speak on this.

973
01:31:05,638 --> 01:31:06,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

974
01:31:10,032 --> 01:31:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the record, Miss McKay.

975
01:31:14,815 --> 01:31:15,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak on this.

976
01:31:17,457 --> 01:31:17,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

977
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:19,013
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.

978
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can you hear me?

979
01:31:20,494 --> 01:31:20,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

980
01:31:21,474 --> 01:31:22,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought you were rid of me, right?

981
01:31:23,696 --> 01:31:24,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I come in peace.

982
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:32,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, which is not always how I've come in the past.

983
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually following up on what Mr. Russo just said.

984
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:41,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So myself, another teacher from the Robinsonite and a few that are online.

985
01:31:42,025 --> 01:31:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here tonight to ask you to consider starting a process of redistricting the elementary school for the 2025-26 school year.

986
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:55,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we do have elementary schools that are overcrowded, while some schools are under capacity.

987
01:31:56,416 --> 01:32:04,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The Roberts Elementary School currently has 594 students enrolled, like Dr. Galussi said, that might be fluid from when I wrote this.

988
01:32:04,702 --> 01:32:10,166
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, second only to MedFed Vocational Technical High School, we are the largest school in MedFed.

989
01:32:10,986 --> 01:32:18,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Our school currently houses two meet preschool classrooms, five connections classrooms and 27 regular education classrooms.

990
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We have five kindergarten, first and third grade classrooms and four second, fourth and fifth grade classrooms.

991
01:32:25,598 --> 01:32:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, our second grade enrollment is borderline for needing five classrooms.

992
01:32:30,869 --> 01:32:33,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Our building is at full capacity without room for any more.

993
01:32:34,713 --> 01:32:47,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Our school required a major restructuring of space this summer to accommodate all of the grade level classrooms, as well as spaces for our reading specialists, adjustment Councilors, speech, OT, PT, and special education classrooms.

994
01:32:47,786 --> 01:32:53,011
[SPEAKER_02]: There's currently not one open space available in our school, with some teachers having to double up.

995
01:32:54,193 --> 01:33:03,495
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the website mass.gov in 2021, Massachusetts had 69,127 live births, which was a 4% increase from 2020.

996
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:10,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year is the year that this is going to impact our schools as the children will begin entering kindergarten.

997
01:33:11,057 --> 01:33:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see this impact for the next two years and are anticipating that we will continue to need five kindergarten classrooms at the Roberts Elementary School.

998
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Logically, when there is a large number of kindergarten classrooms at a school, the trend of needing five classrooms per grade level continues up throughout the grades, as is the current situation we find ourselves in.

999
01:33:30,387 --> 01:33:35,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We can expect that next year we will need five fourth grades, and the following year we'll need five fifth grades.

1000
01:33:36,112 --> 01:33:44,238
[SPEAKER_02]: If more second graders move in, we may possibly even need five second grade classrooms, and we simply do not have the physical space within our building for this.

1001
01:33:45,085 --> 01:33:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently grade levels with only four classrooms per grade level have a large amount of students in each classroom.

1002
01:33:50,508 --> 01:33:52,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have students that are arriving daily.

1003
01:33:53,749 --> 01:33:57,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that it is necessary for Medford to begin redistricting the schools.

1004
01:33:57,911 --> 01:34:01,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Redistricting allows the schools to be balanced, which creates equity in learning.

1005
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:05,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We want all children to have access to an equal education.

1006
01:34:05,655 --> 01:34:10,117
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be able to meet the needs of our students in a balanced and fair educational system.

1007
01:34:10,597 --> 01:34:13,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are asking you to please consider this matter.

1008
01:34:14,339 --> 01:34:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: and create a plan to redistrict our schools so that we can fairly and safely educate the Children in Medford.

1009
01:34:20,386 --> 01:34:20,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1010
01:34:22,388 --> 01:34:24,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Miss McKay heard loud and clear.

1011
01:34:29,976 --> 01:34:33,119
[SPEAKER_06]: May I ask what that looks like?

1012
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that initiated by school committee?

1013
01:34:34,941 --> 01:34:36,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that initiated by the district?

1014
01:34:47,627 --> 01:35:05,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I can echo there is no room in the end, no room, no room in the cafeteria at the Roberts everywhere is packed in the Roberts has the smallest playground structure of all of the just, just where they're physically located their landlocked.

1015
01:35:05,547 --> 01:35:07,047
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no room.

1016
01:35:08,088 --> 01:35:09,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So we really need to do something.

1017
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:17,470
[SPEAKER_14]: But where the Roberts is located is also where we have the most triple-deckers, the most apartment buildings along the Fells Way.

1018
01:35:18,091 --> 01:35:22,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is where we have a heavy, heavy concentration of families.

1019
01:35:23,012 --> 01:35:25,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.

1020
01:35:26,273 --> 01:35:26,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1021
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:44,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think whether it's redistricting or other options, there are things being explored behind the scenes, I know, by admin, so I'm sure you're creating a plan and we're gonna bring that to us, whether it be redistricting or X, Y, and Z, because something obviously needs to be done.

1022
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:49,051
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been an issue for several years at the Roberts that I'm aware of.

1023
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

1024
01:35:56,935 --> 01:36:05,677
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that we've been working on through the MSBA process is working with MSBA to certify our enrollment projection for Medford High.

1025
01:36:06,277 --> 01:36:14,338
[SPEAKER_11]: That enrollment projection, when we sort of get to agreement, is how we will decide how big the school becomes.

1026
01:36:14,438 --> 01:36:21,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've had to actually do a lot of really interesting and fascinating work around future projected enrollment.

1027
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we

1028
01:36:23,133 --> 01:36:28,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to give them information about like our live births and we have to give them information about.

1029
01:36:29,577 --> 01:36:34,020
[SPEAKER_11]: projected housing and there's been a whole slew of information we've had to provide to them.

1030
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:47,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I am working to make it a little bit more digestible because you have to submit everything into this system and it makes it really hard to extract it in a way that it makes sense.

1031
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:54,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I am working on something to be able to put on the website so people can see that, but it's been an interesting conversation with

1032
01:36:55,115 --> 01:37:05,038
[SPEAKER_11]: folks at City Hall about like what what is actually coming down the pike from a housing perspective and housing production goals and all of that good stuff.

1033
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:24,002
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think the other thing that I would say is I would love for the city staff to be watching carefully when real estate in the Roberts neighborhood like directly adjacent becomes available because there is no way out of the parking situation over there and there's no way out of the playground situation without more space.

1034
01:37:24,642 --> 01:37:39,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think the city needs to do something seriously to address that because you can't, there are 200 more kids trying to use that playground than trying to use the two playgrounds at Missittuck and a giant field.

1035
01:37:39,746 --> 01:37:45,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's, and there's just literally not time to walk to Hickey Park for recess every single day.

1036
01:37:46,627 --> 01:37:56,916
[SPEAKER_11]: something has to give there, whether that building becomes drastically smaller in enrollment because of the space constraints or we try to address the space constraints.

1037
01:37:56,936 --> 01:38:04,962
[SPEAKER_11]: There's probably a bunch of facets there, some of which are in our control and some of which are probably more city-controlled sort of

1038
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:06,942
[SPEAKER_11]: endeavors and decisions.

1039
01:38:07,023 --> 01:38:10,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to look at all of that when we think about district.

1040
01:38:10,206 --> 01:38:17,075
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a reasonable time frame to get that kind of report of what that looks like or what models are being considered?

1041
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:29,180
[SPEAKER_11]: The enrollment projection report, probably within a month or so, I will have that up online for everybody because it is a document that we can share.

1042
01:38:30,441 --> 01:38:33,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So that piece is easy enough to provide.

1043
01:38:33,684 --> 01:38:41,092
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just sort of, it's a formatting mess, and I think it's gonna be really hard for people to digest the way that it sort of gets extracted from the system right now.

1044
01:38:42,093 --> 01:39:00,648
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of like that bigger conversation about what happens next, I'll defer to the superintendent, but I would imagine we have to have some meetings where we talk about like what even our goals would be for that kind of conversation because something like that could start like this big and it could end up this big and it could go in any sort of direction.

1045
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So we might want to think about sort of

1046
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,742
[SPEAKER_11]: putting some parameters around what we're trying to accomplish.

1047
01:39:05,762 --> 01:39:08,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a special meeting of this body?

1048
01:39:09,004 --> 01:39:11,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a strategic planning group?

1049
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:17,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could maybe do it either way, but I would think it's maybe a committee of the whole because it's such a big project.

1050
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:25,185
[SPEAKER_08]: and hopefully some ideas will be brought to the entire committee within the next month or two.

1051
01:39:25,205 --> 01:39:28,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Superintendent, I cut you off if you were gonna address the time.

1052
01:39:28,849 --> 01:39:39,220
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, I just was gonna say, it definitely, the data for the MSBA, which Member Graham was just mentioning, and really trying to

1053
01:39:41,631 --> 01:39:46,936
[SPEAKER_14]: There are easy solutions where you say, you need a bigger building, but we're trying to focus on the high school.

1054
01:39:47,357 --> 01:40:01,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can't necessarily talk about another building, but how we could either look at different programs, which member Ruseau made mention of that our EL program has traveled to every single elementary school at one point or another.

1055
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:05,594
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we have had to make programming shifts as well.

1056
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:10,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So all of the above is something that we would have to look at.

1057
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:17,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Specialized programs, what are the numbers, and how can we do it in an equitable fashion.

1058
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:23,337
[SPEAKER_14]: But the Roberts situation, we are definitely aware that we need to

1059
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:27,238
[SPEAKER_14]: we need to start at least trying to come up with a game plan.

1060
01:40:27,879 --> 01:40:41,385
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think once we have that, the final numbers from the MSBA, the enrollment projections to engage the community, the staff in being part of that process.

1061
01:40:43,066 --> 01:40:49,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.

1062
01:40:49,869 --> 01:40:53,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1063
01:40:54,864 --> 01:41:01,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to invite Dr. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Schools, up for our last report, which is a report on operations.

1064
01:41:06,104 --> 01:41:08,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, once again, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1065
01:41:08,606 --> 01:41:10,948
[SPEAKER_18]: It is just the written report tonight, I don't have a presentation.

1066
01:41:10,968 --> 01:41:20,616
[SPEAKER_18]: I do welcome you to come and see a lot of the shiny new equipment in our cafeterias or throughout the district that we've been able to procure as I move through this.

1067
01:41:21,857 --> 01:41:29,223
[SPEAKER_18]: So as this report goes on, there are two specific requests that I'd be seeking approval for this evening.

1068
01:41:30,144 --> 01:41:34,508
[SPEAKER_18]: The first, I'll tailor a little bit more narrowly than in the written report.

1069
01:41:35,568 --> 01:41:38,871
[SPEAKER_18]: as it pertains to the Brooks, second?

1070
01:41:40,212 --> 01:41:42,293
[SPEAKER_18]: It is, hold on, sorry.

1071
01:41:43,254 --> 01:41:43,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

1072
01:41:43,434 --> 01:42:00,205
[SPEAKER_20]: So as it pertains to the Brooks hot water heater, the Brooks hot water heater was the last of those five schools that were built in the early 2000s that had the.

1073
01:42:00,966 --> 01:42:01,346
[SPEAKER_18]: It went off.

1074
01:42:03,067 --> 01:42:10,774
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the last of the five original hot water heaters and it failed in May of 2024.

1075
01:42:12,136 --> 01:42:18,222
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked at doing an emergency procurement for it and just coming and having a plumbing company replace it.

1076
01:42:18,482 --> 01:42:24,568
[SPEAKER_18]: However, in looking at our sustainability goals and looking at best practices for how we should do things,

1077
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:43,277
[SPEAKER_18]: I hit pause on that as we were able to mitigate some of the concerns without having hot water with chemical cleaners, hand sanitizer, installing a four-gallon, if I'm remembering correctly, hot water heater for hand-washing in the kitchen, and doing some other mitigating strategies.

1078
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:48,060
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Member Ruseau had sent a request

1079
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:52,545
[SPEAKER_18]: some questions that are in here as pertains to this.

1080
01:42:53,566 --> 01:42:58,472
[SPEAKER_18]: If any other members have further questions on this, I'm happy to submit them to the engineering company.

1081
01:42:58,512 --> 01:43:03,178
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said back in the springtime, there are a lot of things I'm good at.

1082
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:06,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I can answer engineering questions on HVAC.

1083
01:43:06,822 --> 01:43:09,343
[SPEAKER_18]: um, to only a limited to beyond a limited degree.

1084
01:43:10,203 --> 01:43:14,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the our goal was to do something that was fully electric.

1085
01:43:14,545 --> 01:43:20,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier this evening, the costs are extraordinarily high.

1086
01:43:20,387 --> 01:43:23,408
[SPEAKER_18]: It also requires significant upgrades.

1087
01:43:23,608 --> 01:43:24,728
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not mention this earlier.

1088
01:43:24,748 --> 01:43:29,010
[SPEAKER_18]: It requires significant upgrades to the transformer capacity.

1089
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Um,

1090
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:55,603
[SPEAKER_18]: exterior of the building in the area that I believe that's in the neighborhood of $150,000, inclusive of the $349,000 price, those pieces of equipment would not be ready for upwards of a year to be able to be installed to support what would be needed for the full electrification of this project at the Brooklyn, I'm sorry, at the Brooks.

1091
01:43:56,263 --> 01:44:05,606
[SPEAKER_18]: So my recommendation is, and as I said, more narrowly tailored, is for the design and construction management piece.

1092
01:44:05,626 --> 01:44:15,128
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have to figure out the funding allocation because at present, $150,000 allocation in the school budget is entirely unrealistic.

1093
01:44:16,269 --> 01:44:22,930
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is a pressing capital need that unfortunately forced itself on us.

1094
01:44:26,197 --> 01:44:26,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1095
01:44:28,018 --> 01:44:28,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1096
01:44:28,619 --> 01:44:30,400
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that you tried to get answers.

1097
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:35,124
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't sound like B2Q actually wants to give an answer to the question I asked about.

1098
01:44:36,204 --> 01:44:39,647
[SPEAKER_19]: After 15 years, my question was pretty straightforward.

1099
01:44:39,687 --> 01:44:47,693
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any reason to believe that when this equipment must be replaced, that the electric replacement equipment in 10 to 15 years will be any cheaper than it is today?

1100
01:44:50,275 --> 01:44:54,038
[SPEAKER_19]: There's going to be a day when we're not going to be able to replace this stuff with

1101
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,743
[SPEAKER_19]: with fossil fuel-based equipment.

1102
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:10,432
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I look at expenses like the electrical upgrade, the infrastructure upgrade that's going to be required if we chose the electrical option, well, that number will get bigger and bigger every year.

1103
01:45:10,452 --> 01:45:14,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that's a lot of labor and big equipment.

1104
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:17,358
[SPEAKER_19]: So every year, that number will continue to go up.

1105
01:45:17,498 --> 01:45:21,141
[SPEAKER_19]: So in 15 years, I don't know, double, triple, whatever it will be today.

1106
01:45:23,163 --> 01:45:24,164
[SPEAKER_19]: On top of inflation.

1107
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:40,924
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, my estimate, you know, is that we are looking at just being fine with an additional hundred and 85,000 pounds of carbon emissions by choosing the gas option over the electric option.

1108
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:50,158
[SPEAKER_19]: I really wanted them to do analysis, like just pretend electric rates don't change between now and 15 years from now.

1109
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:55,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretend the gas rates don't change, because we can't know those two things.

1110
01:45:56,060 --> 01:46:00,060
[SPEAKER_19]: But what would it cost to operate these two pieces of equipment over 15 years?

1111
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:02,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why that was too hard for them.

1112
01:46:03,021 --> 01:46:10,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Based on the response, it sounds like they didn't want to be bothered, because this sentence here, frankly, is really obnoxious.

1113
01:46:11,043 --> 01:46:11,463
[SPEAKER_19]: It says,

1114
01:46:14,426 --> 01:46:15,486
[SPEAKER_19]: sorry, where's that sentence?

1115
01:46:16,667 --> 01:46:20,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Essentially, they're saying all that we should care about is cost.

1116
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:22,771
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what they're saying.

1117
01:46:23,231 --> 01:46:29,615
[SPEAKER_19]: They're assuming that the only thing this committee, this community, and humanity should care about is how much it costs.

1118
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:34,798
[SPEAKER_19]: And if that's the case, we should all get some coal going, because coal is probably cheaper than everything else.

1119
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:36,859
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't,

1120
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:51,204
[SPEAKER_19]: find their answer particularly satisfying and I hope that in the future we can decide that we're not going to accept their answer until they actually give us an answer that answers our questions.

1121
01:46:51,384 --> 01:47:04,207
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not inappropriate for this committee to want to know this information as we are about to take a vote to pollute an additional 185,000 pounds of carbon into this atmosphere for one boiler at one school.

1122
01:47:06,288 --> 01:47:07,048
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think it's,

1123
01:47:08,805 --> 01:47:13,569
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's absurd that they don't see this as anything other than a cost analysis.

1124
01:47:17,832 --> 01:47:21,255
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how else to be more ticked off about it than that.

1125
01:47:22,596 --> 01:47:24,258
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll let my colleagues ask their questions.

1126
01:47:27,581 --> 01:47:34,927
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, I will say that this has nothing to do with our OPM or our designer.

1127
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:38,542
[SPEAKER_18]: It has been extraordinarily sobering overall.

1128
01:47:42,177 --> 01:47:54,082
[SPEAKER_18]: a lack of viable options for moving more quickly to full electrification or to really move off of fossil fuels through these projects.

1129
01:47:54,722 --> 01:47:57,323
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the best word I can use is sobering.

1130
01:47:57,343 --> 01:48:02,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I had high ambitious goals for us to be able to do those types of things.

1131
01:48:02,785 --> 01:48:09,548
[SPEAKER_18]: And just unfortunately, it's either exorbitantly costed to do it or

1132
01:48:10,508 --> 01:48:15,270
[SPEAKER_18]: the equipment does not exist in ways that we might think it would.

1133
01:48:17,751 --> 01:48:21,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it sounds like cost and time because of the equipment.

1134
01:48:21,593 --> 01:48:24,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So remember, Ryan filed then member Russell again.

1135
01:48:24,834 --> 01:48:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting

1136
01:48:31,502 --> 01:48:42,206
[SPEAKER_06]: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.

1137
01:48:42,466 --> 01:48:44,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this one's too expensive.

1138
01:48:44,407 --> 01:48:46,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And they all end up being too expensive.

1139
01:48:46,348 --> 01:48:47,148
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to do this.

1140
01:48:47,788 --> 01:48:53,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, big picture, this was the last one to fail, but what's next?

1141
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:55,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1142
01:48:55,672 --> 01:48:56,552
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the subcommittee?

1143
01:48:57,132 --> 01:48:58,493
[SPEAKER_06]: The capital planning subcommittee.

1144
01:48:58,513 --> 01:48:58,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1145
01:49:05,357 --> 01:49:06,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need more language?

1146
01:49:07,038 --> 01:49:07,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I got enough, thank you.

1147
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:08,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

1148
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:24,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion's on the floor by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Graham to have a capital meeting with the subcommittee to discuss a plan.

1149
01:49:26,285 --> 01:49:28,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval, all those in favor?

1150
01:49:28,705 --> 01:49:28,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1151
01:49:29,066 --> 01:49:29,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1152
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:30,066
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1153
01:49:30,626 --> 01:49:31,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1154
01:49:32,467 --> 01:49:32,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

1155
01:49:34,547 --> 01:49:40,610
[SPEAKER_19]: This just dawned on me when somebody mentioned, I think you mentioned kitchen and electrification.

1156
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:42,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, sorry, yeah.

1157
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:49,034
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we did buy stuff that we have to send back because our electrical infrastructure can't handle it.

1158
01:49:49,555 --> 01:49:59,200
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, when we decide we want to replace the Brooks's kitchen equipment with induction everything,

1159
01:50:00,339 --> 01:50:04,200
[SPEAKER_19]: We will be paying this expense then because we won't be able to do it then.

1160
01:50:04,701 --> 01:50:12,924
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's kind of like every project that is around electrification, we will either decide that we're just going to, well, I guess we can't do it, it's too expensive.

1161
01:50:13,044 --> 01:50:17,265
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's like the same big expense in the middle of all of those decisions.

1162
01:50:19,326 --> 01:50:38,665
[SPEAKER_19]: And which year we decide which budget do we decide when does the city ever really have enough money to do that stuff that's, those are big, big questions but we're never going to get to our goals around carbon emissions if we just every time we have the decision we're like well we can't afford it right now.

1163
01:50:39,626 --> 01:50:40,587
[SPEAKER_19]: We're never going to afford it.

1164
01:50:41,415 --> 01:50:51,886
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing too, we just replaced, and I brought this before the committee prior to doing it, we just replaced a number of ovens across the district.

1165
01:50:52,407 --> 01:50:55,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And our hope was that those were going to be electric ovens.

1166
01:50:56,551 --> 01:51:02,637
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, even in our quote unquote new schools, which I know we should not use that terminology,

1167
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:20,103
[SPEAKER_18]: The electrical circuitry was either not identified or misidentified, which would have related to even further and higher costs dating back to original construction and development.

1168
01:51:20,603 --> 01:51:22,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Trust me, those buildings were built very well.

1169
01:51:24,186 --> 01:51:30,872
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to be able to identify the circuitry, I don't know the exact voltage or amperage, but if something trips,

1170
01:51:31,592 --> 01:51:41,707
[SPEAKER_18]: With this new equipment, you're supposed to call in an electrician rather than have director Smith go and flip the breaker herself because there's a possible of electrocution.

1171
01:51:42,408 --> 01:51:45,432
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's, um, it just

1172
01:51:46,610 --> 01:52:06,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, at every turn, because when Director Smith and I, Director Smith of Food Services and I started on this path of really updating the kitchen equipment for the first time in all the years that the kitchens have been open at the five schools, our goal was to replace them with all electric.

1173
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,382
[SPEAKER_18]: But the time, cost really isn't even a factor when it comes to

1174
01:52:14,142 --> 01:52:18,925
[SPEAKER_18]: food services because we have a surplus there, our four specific food services expenses.

1175
01:52:20,026 --> 01:52:27,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, the challenge is the time to get the equipment in, in order to serve and prepare for our kids.

1176
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:33,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, so in the report later on, I talk about what we will be doing to slowly move forward.

1177
01:52:33,553 --> 01:52:38,676
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, it's something that we all wanted to be a snap of the fingers.

1178
01:52:39,216 --> 01:52:41,798
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, this equipment is at the end of its life.

1179
01:52:42,606 --> 01:52:43,767
[SPEAKER_18]: let's move to full electric.

1180
01:52:44,828 --> 01:52:53,475
[SPEAKER_18]: The challenges with that proved to be, I would use the term exponential as compared to what we expected.

1181
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1182
01:53:01,742 --> 01:53:09,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor, we do need to approve the capital planning, the capital purchase.

1183
01:53:09,488 --> 01:53:11,230
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll make the motion to approve it because

1184
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:13,250
[SPEAKER_19]: They need a boiler.

1185
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:30,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And then before I call for a second, if we could just make sure that the purchase and either a short description and the price tag is on the agenda, just so we aren't referring back and forth, because I'm going with an electronic copy.

1186
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,681
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be very helpful for the future.

1187
01:53:33,781 --> 01:53:36,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by?

1188
01:53:36,462 --> 01:53:36,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1189
01:53:37,343 --> 01:53:38,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Olapade, all those in favor?

1190
01:53:39,624 --> 01:53:39,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1191
01:53:39,724 --> 01:53:40,764
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1192
01:53:40,844 --> 01:53:41,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1193
01:53:42,613 --> 01:53:43,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1194
01:53:47,197 --> 01:54:00,428
[SPEAKER_18]: So the second request for approval by this committee, based on previous work I've done in other school districts, student parking does have a fee with it.

1195
01:54:00,608 --> 01:54:06,293
[SPEAKER_18]: The high school leadership team has asked me to come forward this evening to request a $150 annual fee that would fund

1196
01:54:12,217 --> 01:54:18,320
[SPEAKER_18]: activities for those students across the school.

1197
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:32,387
[SPEAKER_18]: And if the senior class members want to paint their space, 50% of the fee would go to the senior class fundraising efforts for various activities throughout the year for seniors.

1198
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:49,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm requesting, as part of the rate card, this seems the best place for this type of thing to live, because then it would fall under annual review of the school committee, but would be designated to go to a student activities account.

1199
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:51,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Senior class activities account is already set up.

1200
01:54:51,518 --> 01:54:58,344
[SPEAKER_18]: We would need to set up the other student activities account to make sure that it falls within the stated purpose.

1201
01:55:00,065 --> 01:55:04,786
[SPEAKER_18]: for student-centered community activities as requested by the high school leadership?

1202
01:55:06,387 --> 01:55:19,490
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can from the chair, I mean, I think we all should speak on it, but it's not on the agenda, and I don't feel comfortable moving forward with it until it's like we're transparently putting it on an agenda, because report on operations I don't think covers it.

1203
01:55:20,071 --> 01:55:21,911
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion from the chair.

1204
01:55:22,211 --> 01:55:23,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, and then.

1205
01:55:24,212 --> 01:55:24,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't.

1206
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:31,470
[SPEAKER_06]: member I felt I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.

1207
01:55:32,491 --> 01:55:35,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a parking fee for vehicles and that.

1208
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:52,684
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's student transportation as in their own vehicles, whereas the fees that students pay for a bus pass for the MBTA go to the MBTA, but we collect no other transportation fees.

1209
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:58,386
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's more of just, I would say, a parking fee as opposed to a transportation fee.

1210
01:56:03,097 --> 01:56:04,322
[SPEAKER_08]: member Graham.

1211
01:56:04,462 --> 01:56:07,011
[SPEAKER_11]: I would agree with you that this should go on the agenda.

1212
01:56:07,312 --> 01:56:09,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm generally not in favor of

1213
01:56:10,735 --> 01:56:14,216
[SPEAKER_11]: charging kids to get to school no matter how they have to get there.

1214
01:56:16,156 --> 01:56:17,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should charge for buses.

1215
01:56:17,797 --> 01:56:19,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should provide more buses than we do.

1216
01:56:20,477 --> 01:56:24,558
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've been paying attention on social media, there's a lot of conversation about buses.

1217
01:56:26,419 --> 01:56:33,460
[SPEAKER_11]: The program around free MBTA transportation was stopped without this committee's authorization to do so.

1218
01:56:34,381 --> 01:56:37,001
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to stop charging kids to get them to school.

1219
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:39,802
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our job to educate them, and we can't do that if they're not in school.

1220
01:56:40,968 --> 01:56:44,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Like for me, for any which way that we're going to charge.

1221
01:56:45,531 --> 01:56:47,533
[SPEAKER_11]: families to get them to school.

1222
01:56:47,593 --> 01:56:51,015
[SPEAKER_11]: It just feels like we're heading in the wrong direction.

1223
01:56:51,035 --> 01:56:55,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that we are charging some kids and not others, and I think that is also a problem.

1224
01:56:56,299 --> 01:57:01,663
[SPEAKER_11]: But charging more kids for me doesn't get us closer to the goal of not charging kids to have to get to school.

1225
01:57:01,743 --> 01:57:11,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not super in favor of this, but I do think it should go on the agenda separately noticed so that parents can understand that that's what we are talking about.

1226
01:57:13,223 --> 01:57:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion to, motion to table?

1227
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:21,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even, it's not even on the agenda, so there's.

1228
01:57:21,672 --> 01:57:22,693
[SPEAKER_18]: I can withdraw it and bring it back.

1229
01:57:22,713 --> 01:57:27,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe withdraw it and then just make sure it's very transparent on the agenda for our next meeting.

1230
01:57:27,999 --> 01:57:30,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be very appreciated.

1231
01:57:30,282 --> 01:57:31,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1232
01:57:33,858 --> 01:57:36,099
[SPEAKER_18]: So McGlynn playground update.

1233
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:41,082
[SPEAKER_18]: We had hoped to have the playground open for the end of August in the beginning of school.

1234
01:57:42,283 --> 01:57:50,168
[SPEAKER_18]: There was an unfortunate situation where the playground equipment itself was packaged for efficiency.

1235
01:57:51,068 --> 01:57:57,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And at the same exact time, so that meant multiple pieces of equipment, parts were mixed in together.

1236
01:57:58,011 --> 01:58:06,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And at the same time, the playground manufacturer changed their labeling system but failed to update in a timely enough fashion their instruction manuals.

1237
01:58:07,555 --> 01:58:14,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So a piece of equipment that may have taken between five and eight hours to sort, that piece of equipment took approximately 40 hours.

1238
01:58:14,878 --> 01:58:16,539
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just one piece of equipment.

1239
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:20,745
[SPEAKER_18]: So it led to an extreme delay.

1240
01:58:20,905 --> 01:58:31,662
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing that really caused a delay in visiting the playground during the summer prior to August 1st, the intense heat to work out there.

1241
01:58:33,083 --> 01:58:51,269
[SPEAKER_18]: cause, and we have put in, I believe it's 66 trees, countless shrubs, bushes, that once those mature, the heat element of the playground should not be as much of an issue, especially as we had in school and shoulder months away from summer, but working out there was a challenge.

1242
01:58:51,769 --> 01:58:55,811
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have tentatively, not tentatively, we have scheduled October 8th

1243
01:58:56,871 --> 01:58:58,012
[SPEAKER_18]: at 3.30 p.m.

1244
01:58:58,572 --> 01:59:00,314
[SPEAKER_18]: as a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

1245
01:59:01,214 --> 01:59:07,479
[SPEAKER_18]: We anticipate being done with the full playground toward the last week of September.

1246
01:59:07,959 --> 01:59:14,905
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll use that time to go through punch list items and other things that need to be fixed, repaired, swapped out.

1247
01:59:16,045 --> 01:59:18,948
[SPEAKER_18]: We were sent the wrong color scheme for the WeGo round.

1248
01:59:19,248 --> 01:59:22,010
[SPEAKER_18]: The manufacturer has accepted full responsibility for that.

1249
01:59:23,271 --> 01:59:27,816
[SPEAKER_18]: All the colors were designed for accessibility for students with vision impairments.

1250
01:59:28,837 --> 01:59:38,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Our carpentry shop and metal fab is in the process of rehabbing the buddy bench so that it can be reinstalled at the playground.

1251
01:59:42,553 --> 01:59:46,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to go into detail if anyone has any questions about the McGlynn Playground.

1252
01:59:46,617 --> 02:00:07,377
[SPEAKER_18]: But in addition to playgrounds, we also received upwards of $20,000 from the Community Preservation Fund in Medford for three bike repair stations, one at Medford High School, one at the Andrews, one at the McGlynn, and for a significant upgrade to bike racks

1253
02:00:07,697 --> 02:00:13,380
[SPEAKER_18]: not covered at this time, but bike rack upgrades at the McGlynn and Medford High School.

1254
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:26,127
[SPEAKER_18]: We've already installed upgraded bike racks from a grant, thanks to Vivian Ortiz and other members of Smart Routes to School for us to be able to really install those at the Andrews.

1255
02:00:26,487 --> 02:00:28,028
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see those already installed.

1256
02:00:28,388 --> 02:00:32,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Our goal is to have the repair stations installed in the next couple of weeks here.

1257
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:34,211
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working through procurement on that.

1258
02:00:36,065 --> 02:00:36,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld.

1259
02:00:36,845 --> 02:00:43,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.

1260
02:00:43,287 --> 02:00:45,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You said they accepted full responsibility.

1261
02:00:45,168 --> 02:00:49,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that, is that just an, I'm sorry, is that, do we?

1262
02:00:49,129 --> 02:00:54,190
[SPEAKER_18]: So on this, on this issue, we don't see remuneration coming.

1263
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:57,151
[SPEAKER_18]: On other issues regarding the playground, the,

1264
02:01:00,192 --> 02:01:09,839
[SPEAKER_18]: The shed canopy structure, pavilion, over the stage, for lack of a better term, was not properly drilled.

1265
02:01:10,259 --> 02:01:14,262
[SPEAKER_18]: So they had to send a jig out, and that caused several days delay.

1266
02:01:14,802 --> 02:01:17,604
[SPEAKER_18]: That did come with several thousand dollars remuneration.

1267
02:01:17,624 --> 02:01:18,125
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1268
02:01:18,205 --> 02:01:21,267
[SPEAKER_18]: And what about the parts, the manual?

1269
02:01:23,048 --> 02:01:23,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, nothing.

1270
02:01:24,069 --> 02:01:25,210
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1271
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:26,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry for that.

1272
02:01:27,283 --> 02:01:40,610
[SPEAKER_18]: But I will say that Quirk Construction and Copley-Wolf have done a good job on really being budget hawks on this and supporting us.

1273
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:44,672
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.

1274
02:01:44,712 --> 02:01:46,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.

1275
02:01:46,373 --> 02:01:46,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

1276
02:01:47,874 --> 02:01:50,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.

1277
02:01:51,155 --> 02:01:55,418
[SPEAKER_18]: I do as well, and the principal, assistant principal, and all the students who are still on Hormel.

1278
02:01:57,217 --> 02:02:00,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1279
02:02:01,859 --> 02:02:03,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1280
02:02:03,379 --> 02:02:17,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And while you're looking for your next item, maybe a thought process before the next meeting on the parking spot issue is teens, high school students paying for a spot so they can decorate and have their own.

1281
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that, just to think more a little bit more creatively.

1282
02:02:22,506 --> 02:02:24,327
[SPEAKER_18]: I will work with our high school staff.

1283
02:02:24,407 --> 02:02:24,887
[SPEAKER_08]: On to the next.

1284
02:02:26,384 --> 02:02:26,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Transportation.

1285
02:02:28,351 --> 02:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_18]: I put this on so that we can have an open and honest conversation.

1286
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:43,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So despite budgeting for and requesting additional buses, our yellow bus provider has, as to yet, been unable to provide those additional buses.

1287
02:02:45,177 --> 02:02:56,422
[SPEAKER_18]: In particular, those buses would help alleviate overcrowding on our middle school runs, as well as our routes at the Brooks and the Roberts.

1288
02:02:57,757 --> 02:03:00,998
[SPEAKER_18]: evidence by the enrollment update that was given by Dr. Galusi.

1289
02:03:02,759 --> 02:03:18,005
[SPEAKER_18]: So these buses are really critical to alleviate the overcrowding and to also provide transportation to our students looking to get to some aftercare programs so the parents are not faced with that burden as they are in other districts.

1290
02:03:18,725 --> 02:03:24,666
[SPEAKER_18]: We are also working through with one of our new partners, SNL, Saturday Night Lights.

1291
02:03:24,706 --> 02:03:28,267
[SPEAKER_18]: You may remember them from helping to put on the fifth grade Olympics.

1292
02:03:29,167 --> 02:03:31,808
[SPEAKER_18]: They're working at the Brooks right now in particular.

1293
02:03:32,408 --> 02:03:47,052
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we have permission slip requests out to families for that interim time from dismissal to about today, pick up by that late bus was 337, in order to get them to, I believe it's Ready, Set, Kids and Sigma.

1294
02:03:49,032 --> 02:03:59,677
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're trying to work the work the problem and also make sure that we're examining our bus contract by our count and

1295
02:04:01,625 --> 02:04:03,827
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it says approximately 18 buses.

1296
02:04:04,968 --> 02:04:13,536
[SPEAKER_18]: By my count, we have four buses to completely fulfill our contract based on an invoice received today for 14 buses.

1297
02:04:13,916 --> 02:04:20,322
[SPEAKER_18]: So in my opinion, we're going to continue to press our yellow bus provider.

1298
02:04:21,923 --> 02:04:26,867
[SPEAKER_18]: to make sure that we are receiving the buses that our students need.

1299
02:04:27,488 --> 02:04:31,371
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there was, we sent out a transportation memo to families.

1300
02:04:31,971 --> 02:04:37,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want families to think that there's a blanket under two miles, you're cut off or anything like that.

1301
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:43,020
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just because of the overcrowding, we really have to take a look at each and every student.

1302
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:49,404
[SPEAKER_18]: By no means, if your child is in a dangerous situation, are we gonna throw them off of a bus?

1303
02:04:51,085 --> 02:04:52,986
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have enough crossing guards in the city.

1304
02:04:53,146 --> 02:05:05,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm working with the chief on that to post on Facebook and to recruit and to see if we have employees that could do special employee status and work crossing guard lunch duty or whatever it may be.

1305
02:05:07,429 --> 02:05:18,412
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to solve and problem solve these complex issues to make sure that our families and students are first safe and then have the convenience slash

1306
02:05:19,512 --> 02:05:30,820
[SPEAKER_18]: requirements of life in 2024-2025 to make sure that their children are supported between the time they get out of school and the time that they are able to get home from work to be with their children.

1307
02:05:32,001 --> 02:05:38,585
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a complex problem that unfortunately is being faced across the nation when it comes to bus shortages.

1308
02:05:39,766 --> 02:05:42,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Our yellow bus contractor has the equipment

1309
02:05:43,813 --> 02:05:50,057
[SPEAKER_18]: they are allegedly training drivers, and we hope that that is gonna yield benefit.

1310
02:05:50,277 --> 02:05:55,139
[SPEAKER_18]: It is budgeted for, we have the resources for those two additional buses.

1311
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:04,965
[SPEAKER_18]: If something doesn't give in the coming days, we will put together an RFP to seek two buses from elsewhere if necessary.

1312
02:06:06,325 --> 02:06:10,968
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I know that this is a very discussed issue at this point.

1313
02:06:11,753 --> 02:06:17,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, did they say how long it's going to take to train the bus drivers that are in training?

1314
02:06:17,502 --> 02:06:20,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they say how long it's going to take for Medford to get two more?

1315
02:06:22,073 --> 02:06:29,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So I did speak with Mr. Chuck Glitzer, who's the owner of Eastern Bus today.

1316
02:06:30,642 --> 02:06:33,985
[SPEAKER_14]: They are facing the same crisis that's happening everywhere.

1317
02:06:34,526 --> 02:06:40,973
[SPEAKER_14]: They trained 16 new bus drivers, and two weeks before school started,

1318
02:06:43,896 --> 02:07:01,898
[SPEAKER_14]: 12 of those bus drivers moved on for different reasons, so they were down to four bus drivers and they are retraining again so we spoke today in person I was also with Megan who is over our family and community engagement.

1319
02:07:03,238 --> 02:07:05,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So he is working diligently.

1320
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:21,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I expressed the pressing issue that Medford is facing, and he is prioritizing Medford and said he wants to be able to provide us with an update before the end of this month, but I am gonna continue to check in with him.

1321
02:07:22,402 --> 02:07:25,683
[SPEAKER_14]: But he clearly expressed that they thought they were ahead.

1322
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:34,705
[SPEAKER_14]: They have their own training, but I think there's a lot of poaching going on and people moving from one company to another company.

1323
02:07:35,225 --> 02:07:40,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was the information that he had today, but that they are working towards that.

1324
02:07:41,706 --> 02:07:46,207
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have 14 buses servicing the Medford Public Schools.

1325
02:07:46,767 --> 02:07:49,668
[SPEAKER_14]: The additional two buses that were requested

1326
02:07:50,829 --> 02:07:56,773
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not being charged for those additional buses because they're not servicing the Medford public schools.

1327
02:07:57,534 --> 02:08:08,902
[SPEAKER_14]: And also because we are in collaboration or coordination with the Catholic schools, they have access to approximately three school buses.

1328
02:08:09,843 --> 02:08:14,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is inclusive of the total number of buses.

1329
02:08:15,747 --> 02:08:19,570
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, we're not being charged for the buses that we don't have access to.

1330
02:08:20,549 --> 02:08:24,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, just to follow up the training that the current.

1331
02:08:26,165 --> 02:08:27,065
[SPEAKER_08]: personnel are in now?

1332
02:08:27,145 --> 02:08:28,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a two-week training?

1333
02:08:28,526 --> 02:08:29,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a four-week training?

1334
02:08:30,587 --> 02:08:32,007
[SPEAKER_14]: He did say it was several weeks.

1335
02:08:32,067 --> 02:08:36,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't ask for the specific number with the CDL license.

1336
02:08:36,249 --> 02:08:51,074
[SPEAKER_14]: They do have a small group going through right now, but he did say that, you know, that large group of 16 that they were really counting on, you know, they didn't expect that they were going to lose 12 of them.

1337
02:08:51,674 --> 02:08:53,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a very competitive

1338
02:08:54,795 --> 02:09:00,180
[SPEAKER_14]: um field out there and he he is trying so I'm going to continue to keep

1339
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:06,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Advocating for Medford and seeing if he can get us some harder numbers.

1340
02:09:06,181 --> 02:09:10,243
[SPEAKER_14]: But at this point in time, they do not have the bodies.

1341
02:09:10,523 --> 02:09:12,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, the money was already allocated.

1342
02:09:13,064 --> 02:09:17,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So they want to have the drivers so they can be compensated for the additional buses.

1343
02:09:18,085 --> 02:09:26,848
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't have the drivers to service our schools and families, and they don't get the compensation because the buses aren't working for us.

1344
02:09:27,908 --> 02:09:30,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And if somebody wants to make a motion,

1345
02:09:31,545 --> 02:09:58,187
[SPEAKER_08]: think since we're not paying for the two buses that we budgeted for, as we hear of overcrowding issues, because like Dr. Cushing said, we're not gonna make kids walk home in a dangerous situation, can we make sure that there's a monitor on those buses with that funding until these two additional ones come online so that we don't have any, so nobody gets hurt and there's no liability on the city and schools?

1346
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:18,064
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could definitely, we don't formally have monitors, but that is something that I'm sure we could definitely try to post and see if whether we could get paraprofessionals or other people who would be interested in being bus monitors for a morning run or afternoon run.

1347
02:10:19,993 --> 02:10:20,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1348
02:10:20,954 --> 02:10:22,657
[SPEAKER_18]: We are also running calculations.

1349
02:10:24,219 --> 02:10:30,768
[SPEAKER_18]: The bus capacity is for grades second and under is 77.

1350
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:34,433
[SPEAKER_18]: For grades three and up is 51.

1351
02:10:36,516 --> 02:10:50,267
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so as we prepare our bus RFP for bid later this year, I'm sure there will be definitely more conversations on that from this body, thinking about transportation across the district.

1352
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:59,775
[SPEAKER_18]: But as we prepare that, we are looking at what it would take for every single student, if needed, to receive transportation.

1353
02:11:00,535 --> 02:11:01,816
[SPEAKER_18]: and what those costs would be.

1354
02:11:03,338 --> 02:11:10,284
[SPEAKER_18]: The rough numbers are bus costs about $115,000 a year.

1355
02:11:11,245 --> 02:11:17,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, those are rough numbers, but $115,000 a year moving into next year.

1356
02:11:18,652 --> 02:11:18,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1357
02:11:20,093 --> 02:11:22,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau, we may have a parent that wants to speak.

1358
02:11:22,856 --> 02:11:23,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, thank you.

1359
02:11:26,582 --> 02:11:43,215
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I'm just reading an article from this last year about Worcester, and they got no bids, so they decided to lease 13 buses, and that's sort of the trial of bringing busing inside.

1360
02:11:44,356 --> 02:11:45,737
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that the

1361
02:11:47,743 --> 02:12:03,311
[SPEAKER_19]: The elephant in the room here is that we want workers to work for $20 or $25 an hour, and for every parent that has ridden on a school bus for a field trip, you know that is utterly insane, because you couldn't pay me enough money to ride on a school bus every day.

1362
02:12:03,331 --> 02:12:04,252
[SPEAKER_19]: No way.

1363
02:12:06,973 --> 02:12:19,652
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, if we want to solve the problem, and I don't think solving the problem is expecting Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies to find these magical people to work for, frankly, not very much money.

1364
02:12:20,906 --> 02:12:24,489
[SPEAKER_19]: for terrible hours, I mean, they're not 40-hour-a-week jobs.

1365
02:12:26,471 --> 02:12:33,538
[SPEAKER_19]: A solution that I'm gonna ask you, if you know of districts that have brought all transportation inside, do they really run into these problems?

1366
02:12:33,858 --> 02:12:38,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Or do they have to pay their workers living wages with a pension and healthcare?

1367
02:12:38,783 --> 02:12:41,946
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't know whether the bus companies do all that stuff.

1368
02:12:42,526 --> 02:12:44,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I do know that they don't pay them enough.

1369
02:12:46,711 --> 02:12:54,073
[SPEAKER_19]: two districts that have brought this stuff all in-house and have a union and all that other stuff, do they have these problems?

1370
02:12:54,093 --> 02:12:59,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this past year, Framingham made the decision facing similar problems.

1371
02:13:00,214 --> 02:13:02,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Framingham brought theirs in.

1372
02:13:02,494 --> 02:13:10,456
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't speak to, I can start calling and speaking to transportation directors, but I don't, in all honesty, know.

1373
02:13:10,956 --> 02:13:13,238
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, I mean, it's just I don't know either.

1374
02:13:13,258 --> 02:13:15,840
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do know Framingham did bring it inside.

1375
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:21,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I would say that's a one to two year planning phase to be able to make sure that you can bring the equipment on board.

1376
02:13:21,744 --> 02:13:31,631
[SPEAKER_18]: If we want to talk about electrification, how does that tie in potentially to Medford High School plans and whatever types of solar arrays and whatever and housing buses there?

1377
02:13:32,191 --> 02:13:33,192
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the types of questions.

1378
02:13:33,572 --> 02:13:38,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Does our DPW or how are they being repaired have the equipment that can be repairing them?

1379
02:13:39,336 --> 02:13:43,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are just broad questions that I've already started to consider.

1380
02:13:43,959 --> 02:13:51,444
[SPEAKER_18]: It is, though, I will say, bringing transportation in-house is a capacity question of the ability for us to do it well.

1381
02:13:52,164 --> 02:14:04,312
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would be, I'd say, like a one to two, two to three year planning phase to be able to make sure that we do it well and it's not something that becomes more of a fiasco than it already is.

1382
02:14:04,632 --> 02:14:07,913
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I certainly don't think we can do that for this upcoming contract.

1383
02:14:07,953 --> 02:14:10,093
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be impossible, I think.

1384
02:14:12,014 --> 02:14:14,174
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know that it's a solution.

1385
02:14:14,374 --> 02:14:21,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the efforts that Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies are going through to find people to work in these jobs.

1386
02:14:22,216 --> 02:14:25,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I heard, I don't even know who I had the conversation with.

1387
02:14:25,377 --> 02:14:31,018
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it was you, but like during the pandemic, all these workers went to work for Uber.

1388
02:14:32,326 --> 02:14:44,769
[SPEAKER_19]: and they're not interested in coming back to a job paying less that is, you know, I won't say worse, because I mean, obviously lots of people who drive buses probably enjoy it.

1389
02:14:46,029 --> 02:14:55,031
[SPEAKER_19]: I would not be one of them, but they all went someplace where they got paid even more with a lot more flexibility and all the other stuff.

1390
02:14:55,151 --> 02:14:58,352
[SPEAKER_19]: So thinking we're gonna get them back,

1391
02:14:59,172 --> 02:15:00,533
[SPEAKER_19]: if we keep paying them the same.

1392
02:15:00,613 --> 02:15:03,014
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the same conversation we have with afterschool.

1393
02:15:03,094 --> 02:15:10,638
[SPEAKER_19]: We really wanna solve the afterschool, and it's 50, it's 60, it's $70 an hour, and you can raise your eyebrows, but do you wanna solve the problem or not?

1394
02:15:11,398 --> 02:15:19,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we're not making new people, so we gotta get people to quit existing jobs to take these jobs.

1395
02:15:19,202 --> 02:15:20,943
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really basic, simple math.

1396
02:15:21,023 --> 02:15:22,304
[SPEAKER_19]: It's capitalism.

1397
02:15:23,584 --> 02:15:25,826
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we want to solve these kinds of problems,

1398
02:15:26,726 --> 02:15:29,328
[SPEAKER_19]: They can be solved, but they are not going to be cheap.

1399
02:15:29,428 --> 02:15:33,671
[SPEAKER_19]: The taxpayers have to decide, do we want to solve the problem or just want to complain about the problem?

1400
02:15:33,731 --> 02:15:42,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the two cannot, or just complain about how much it costs, because you can't have both.

1401
02:15:43,097 --> 02:15:45,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you can, but you don't get a solution.

1402
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1403
02:15:48,381 --> 02:15:48,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

1404
02:15:49,802 --> 02:15:50,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

1405
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:57,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I have huge reservations about any idea that we would have to bring buses in-house.

1406
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:10,091
[SPEAKER_11]: We, I would need to see a bullet proof plan that we're going to do it well, because I think we try to do a lot of things here on the cheap and it never works out.

1407
02:16:10,211 --> 02:16:18,393
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would take a lot of convincing for me to agree that we have the organizational capacity.

1408
02:16:18,493 --> 02:16:22,974
[SPEAKER_11]: We lack basic systems and structures every single place that you look.

1409
02:16:23,714 --> 02:16:26,775
[SPEAKER_11]: to think about bringing on something that we know nothing about.

1410
02:16:26,795 --> 02:16:28,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I have huge reservations about.

1411
02:16:28,656 --> 02:16:39,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could maybe get there at some point, but what I would like to see is for us to own the pieces of this process that we already own and don't do well every single year.

1412
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:44,123
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to completely re envision how we think about bus service.

1413
02:16:44,583 --> 02:16:56,153
[SPEAKER_11]: We should not be asking families, if they are going to ride the bus unless we know that they're eligible to ride the bus and that we have space for them like we know where every kid lives, and we should be using that information.

1414
02:16:56,733 --> 02:17:03,716
[SPEAKER_11]: proactively before two weeks before the start of school to be mapping routes and doing all the things that we need to do.

1415
02:17:03,836 --> 02:17:10,238
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there's a huge amount of improvement to make all around, including with our vendor.

1416
02:17:10,918 --> 02:17:14,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we need to have them come to a future meeting, I'm happy to do that.

1417
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:20,542
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very complicated problem, but we have to own the pieces of this problem that we have failed at as well.

1418
02:17:20,622 --> 02:17:22,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the communication piece of this

1419
02:17:23,163 --> 02:17:34,632
[SPEAKER_11]: and the planning and really just sitting back and saying what should this process look like and when would these steps happen would probably result in a completely different process than we do today.

1420
02:17:35,693 --> 02:17:42,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that is something we can actionably do whether we have two more buses or three more buses or zero more buses like

1421
02:17:43,536 --> 02:17:46,861
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get the registration process right, and we're not even there yet.

1422
02:17:47,001 --> 02:17:49,344
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think that needs to happen.

1423
02:17:49,965 --> 02:17:58,136
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to not be in situations where we're sending emails to families after the start of school, telling them, hey, change your plans.

1424
02:17:59,337 --> 02:18:02,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, we don't actually have a bus for your kids after all.

1425
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do better by this process for the things that we can control.

1426
02:18:06,982 --> 02:18:07,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not everything.

1427
02:18:08,023 --> 02:18:13,967
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't control how many bus drivers quit training in the week before school.

1428
02:18:14,027 --> 02:18:16,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't control that, but we can control a whole lot of other things.

1429
02:18:17,029 --> 02:18:24,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think I would like to see some sort of analysis of how this process should go in the future, because I don't think we're there.

1430
02:18:26,967 --> 02:18:30,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is extraordinarily complicated issue.

1431
02:18:30,589 --> 02:18:32,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I get that and I appreciate that.

1432
02:18:32,451 --> 02:18:43,117
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanna say, I know how hard people are working to try to fix the like unexpected string of problems that are sort of unfolding as the school year unfolds.

1433
02:18:43,177 --> 02:18:45,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do really, really appreciate their work.

1434
02:18:45,699 --> 02:18:50,522
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a new coordinator of transportation in our administrative assistance unit.

1435
02:18:50,702 --> 02:18:53,644
[SPEAKER_11]: She's learning a brand new job that never existed before.

1436
02:18:54,324 --> 02:18:56,225
[SPEAKER_11]: and having to do this all at prime time.

1437
02:18:56,785 --> 02:19:06,227
[SPEAKER_11]: The office is frankly probably too small to have a director that shares responsibilities with all kinds of things and this, and just one administrative assistant.

1438
02:19:06,247 --> 02:19:11,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's a lot of problems here that we need to own ourselves and try to fix and do better by.

1439
02:19:11,108 --> 02:19:16,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we could tighten all of that up, would this problem have been better?

1440
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:17,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

1441
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:21,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not entirely, but probably at least somewhat better.

1442
02:19:21,991 --> 02:19:27,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to do that next year, because we just can't, we do this every year, every year, it's chaos.

1443
02:19:28,276 --> 02:19:32,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems like the chaos shifts every year, but it's still chaos.

1444
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:36,003
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to maybe try not to do chaos next year.

1445
02:19:39,546 --> 02:19:40,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1446
02:19:40,447 --> 02:19:41,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley.

1447
02:19:42,849 --> 02:19:44,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna agree with Member Graham.

1448
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:50,175
[SPEAKER_03]: The proactive word was used, and I feel like we are a district that is constantly reactive.

1449
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:52,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's aggravating.

1450
02:19:52,961 --> 02:19:58,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's aggravating to see that I feel like in so many different aspects, we react to things that happen instead of being proactive.

1451
02:19:58,984 --> 02:20:04,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to hop on board to anybody that wants to be proactive because I'll come to every meeting, but let's be proactive.

1452
02:20:04,607 --> 02:20:05,807
[SPEAKER_03]: We know school's going to start.

1453
02:20:05,847 --> 02:20:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it's going to be warm.

1454
02:20:07,368 --> 02:20:10,029
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that, you know, it's going to get cold.

1455
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:12,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we know these things are going to happen yet.

1456
02:20:12,351 --> 02:20:13,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always shocked.

1457
02:20:13,331 --> 02:20:15,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and I, it, it blows my mind.

1458
02:20:15,832 --> 02:20:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, I don't know why I'm surprised.

1459
02:20:18,053 --> 02:20:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if we could be proactive, that would be great.

1460
02:20:21,056 --> 02:20:22,717
[SPEAKER_03]: We know kids are going to take the bus.

1461
02:20:23,178 --> 02:20:24,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a parent that always filled out that.

1462
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:28,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you know, we live we live here and we're going to take the bus to the Brooks.

1463
02:20:31,706 --> 02:20:37,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why we always end up in a predicament like this, and it's for more than one subject, and it's just.

1464
02:20:39,087 --> 02:20:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: like Memogram said, being proactive.

1465
02:20:40,909 --> 02:20:42,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We know school's gonna start next year.

1466
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:43,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we need the buses.

1467
02:20:43,170 --> 02:20:49,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously there's some stuff that we can't control in many different aspects, but this seems something that we can control.

1468
02:20:49,215 --> 02:20:52,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that you said that you had a meeting coming up.

1469
02:20:52,358 --> 02:20:59,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to join you because I think that this is imperative that, you know, two weeks into school that we're telling parents, well, now we can't take your kid.

1470
02:20:59,884 --> 02:21:05,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, and you said, well, we're not gonna leave your child out, you know, if it's unsafe.

1471
02:21:06,903 --> 02:21:08,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's gonna make that judgment, you?

1472
02:21:09,127 --> 02:21:11,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that you can't, but is the parent gonna make that judgment?

1473
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:13,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think my child can cross Mystic Ave.

1474
02:21:14,174 --> 02:21:15,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, it's only a mile, so they can.

1475
02:21:16,707 --> 02:21:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's fair.

1476
02:21:17,588 --> 02:21:28,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's to say whose child is more responsible to cross High Street or, you know, I know that my son has said to me before when he was at the middle school, I'm gonna ride my bike there.

1477
02:21:28,915 --> 02:21:29,136
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1478
02:21:29,716 --> 02:21:30,336
[SPEAKER_03]: From West Medford?

1479
02:21:30,356 --> 02:21:31,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes no sense to me.

1480
02:21:31,978 --> 02:21:32,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too far.

1481
02:21:32,718 --> 02:21:33,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1482
02:21:34,019 --> 02:21:34,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rush hour traffic.

1483
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:41,344
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many, you know, obviously the bus to me would be the safest route for you to get your kid to school.

1484
02:21:43,181 --> 02:21:44,262
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the convenience of it.

1485
02:21:44,282 --> 02:21:45,262
[SPEAKER_03]: People have to get to work.

1486
02:21:45,683 --> 02:21:54,128
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a district that the majority of parents are two working parents and they have to get to school.

1487
02:21:54,548 --> 02:21:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And to think the kids are gonna walk, I mean, I know when I go for a walk, it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to walk a mile.

1488
02:22:00,312 --> 02:22:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So what time are kids getting up?

1489
02:22:02,173 --> 02:22:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: What time are we sending them out the door?

1490
02:22:03,474 --> 02:22:03,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it dark?

1491
02:22:04,875 --> 02:22:08,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think this all has to factor into it.

1492
02:22:08,538 --> 02:22:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think it's such a, you know,

1493
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:22,792
[SPEAKER_03]: a broad aspect of saying like, you know, we're going to make sure the kids are safe, but who's who's going to be the final say and what's safe for each individual kid.

1494
02:22:23,072 --> 02:22:24,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just think that we just have to throw that out there.

1495
02:22:25,013 --> 02:22:29,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I'd be more than happy to hop on board with any transportation meetings coming up.

1496
02:22:29,154 --> 02:22:31,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can let me know, I'd be more than happy to do that.

1497
02:22:31,214 --> 02:22:32,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1498
02:22:33,135 --> 02:22:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1499
02:22:33,455 --> 02:22:33,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1500
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:39,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Just come on up and give your name and address for the record.

1501
02:22:40,721 --> 02:22:41,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1502
02:22:41,161 --> 02:22:44,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Christine Gullah, 116 Exchange Avenue.

1503
02:22:44,202 --> 02:22:47,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I just agree with these two women.

1504
02:22:47,403 --> 02:22:49,124
[SPEAKER_04]: My daughter just started at Andrews.

1505
02:22:49,484 --> 02:22:52,225
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually get the bus.

1506
02:22:52,725 --> 02:22:56,826
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in housing, so all the kids walk up to Hick's Ave.

1507
02:22:57,423 --> 02:22:58,204
[SPEAKER_04]: in Main Street.

1508
02:22:58,345 --> 02:23:06,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I got an email on Thursday, September 5th, that they're going to be cutting the buses for a two-mile radius.

1509
02:23:06,457 --> 02:23:07,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're like 1.9.

1510
02:23:09,175 --> 02:23:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand what's going on.

1511
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:19,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So my kid is, and all the other kids in the neighborhood are gonna be in jeopardy crossing Mystic Ave, right?

1512
02:23:20,521 --> 02:23:22,763
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't even think about this.

1513
02:23:23,443 --> 02:23:29,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even have a crossing guard there, or the crossing guard near Wegmans.

1514
02:23:29,166 --> 02:23:29,847
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on?

1515
02:23:30,567 --> 02:23:39,515
[SPEAKER_04]: What time does these kids have to start walking to school, seven o'clock, and then the winter time, it's complete dark out.

1516
02:23:39,975 --> 02:23:42,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been a Medford resident for 52 years.

1517
02:23:42,477 --> 02:23:53,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I love Medford to death, but you know, the city plowing's not the best, you know, so what are they gonna, how are they walking these sidewalks?

1518
02:23:54,207 --> 02:23:58,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'd have more parents here for that, but it is what it is.

1519
02:23:58,588 --> 02:24:05,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I think there's been a lot of activity on social media, so we're trying to calm people down because that messaging.

1520
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:07,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on it too, but I just don't, you know.

1521
02:24:08,611 --> 02:24:17,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know if the admin has an answer, but 1.9 miles, I don't think we're going to be excluding anybody from a bus, but I'm not going to speak for, yeah.

1522
02:24:19,094 --> 02:24:20,214
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I got out of it.

1523
02:24:21,904 --> 02:24:24,106
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that the email was- Is that mic on?

1524
02:24:24,326 --> 02:24:24,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1525
02:24:24,647 --> 02:24:24,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1526
02:24:25,147 --> 02:24:45,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the email was, the message was a blanket statement to let people know state laws, regulations, those types of things, but that if a child is ever going to, or families are going to be told that, you know, you live a half mile or whatever it may be, all right, that we would look at each individual situation

1527
02:24:45,704 --> 02:24:51,405
[SPEAKER_18]: to say, all right, you're walking through Roosevelt Circle, you're crossing this major thoroughfare.

1528
02:24:51,865 --> 02:25:05,948
[SPEAKER_18]: For parents to also understand, and for the members of the committee to understand, Medford, with several state roads moving through it, I'm not talking I-83, but I'm talking the Fellsway, and other state roads.

1529
02:25:06,728 --> 02:25:12,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are not under the jurisdiction of the Medford Police for crossing guards.

1530
02:25:13,173 --> 02:25:22,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are under, if I remember correctly, DCR's jurisdiction, which we are then at the mercy of the state to put crossing guards there.

1531
02:25:22,979 --> 02:25:24,440
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't mean to be flippant or anything like that.

1532
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:37,607
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a compounding, complicating factor of if you have students under X distance to school, where if we could have a crossing guard, we may face a barrier with our state partners.

1533
02:25:38,148 --> 02:25:39,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Just this one example.

1534
02:25:40,629 --> 02:25:41,510
[SPEAKER_08]: So we hear you.

1535
02:25:42,617 --> 02:25:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that- I mean, none of the kids in the neighborhood went to the bus stop today.

1536
02:25:47,922 --> 02:25:48,963
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't think there was a bus.

1537
02:25:50,064 --> 02:25:54,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So either they walked or my daughter was actually sick.

1538
02:25:54,047 --> 02:25:56,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually take the kids to school anyway.

1539
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Another parent had to put them in there.

1540
02:25:59,572 --> 02:26:02,175
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're just, we don't know what to do.

1541
02:26:02,235 --> 02:26:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know if it was, the bus is there.

1542
02:26:04,657 --> 02:26:05,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it there for tomorrow?

1543
02:26:05,838 --> 02:26:06,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1544
02:26:06,679 --> 02:26:09,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I have my kid walk up and then she's gonna walk back home?

1545
02:26:11,415 --> 02:26:14,580
[SPEAKER_08]: No bus stops have changed and nobody's there check checking your address.

1546
02:26:15,101 --> 02:26:18,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there probably needs to be some follow up messaging.

1547
02:26:18,305 --> 02:26:20,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a little confusing.

1548
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if your kids have to, I'm just speaking on my kids, if they have to walk

1549
02:26:27,737 --> 02:26:31,478
[SPEAKER_04]: underneath that bridge, basically there's almost homeless people there.

1550
02:26:32,038 --> 02:26:35,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Or walking near McDonald's Park, there's coyotes there.

1551
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:42,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they really had a thought, they thought into this before they put out the email.

1552
02:26:42,062 --> 02:26:44,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that's just me.

1553
02:26:45,443 --> 02:26:47,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel like there should be more.

1554
02:26:48,524 --> 02:26:57,187
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll definitely be able to go back and just look at the different stops, look at the distances and see where we're at, especially for the middle schools.

1555
02:26:59,217 --> 02:27:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the first set of messaging should have been, you know, we're experiencing overcrowding and if you're capable of taking your child, especially if you live more than two miles away, please do so while we, bus drivers are getting trained and we're trying to get two more buses online.

1556
02:27:14,946 --> 02:27:19,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully the admins all here, they heard you loud and clear.

1557
02:27:19,668 --> 02:27:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do know that at state, because at state,

1558
02:27:24,551 --> 02:27:35,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we should have contacted state first before we eliminate and we can't get any crossing guards or cops.

1559
02:27:36,082 --> 02:27:37,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Cops even do it now, right?

1560
02:27:37,764 --> 02:27:38,625
[SPEAKER_04]: State police.

1561
02:27:38,925 --> 02:27:40,226
[SPEAKER_04]: The state police.

1562
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:56,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just scary, because you just want your kids to know.

1563
02:27:56,741 --> 02:28:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a mother came up to me today and said, I didn't know anything about the bus.

1564
02:28:01,443 --> 02:28:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, yeah, there was an email, whatever school, McGlynn, Andrews.

1565
02:28:06,085 --> 02:28:09,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, I don't even know if my daughter made it to school.

1566
02:28:09,287 --> 02:28:10,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen her, because she works.

1567
02:28:10,927 --> 02:28:16,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents rely on these buses, because they both work full time.

1568
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:17,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just scary.

1569
02:28:17,490 --> 02:28:17,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1570
02:28:18,531 --> 02:28:20,632
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my first time up here, so don't mind me.

1571
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:22,771
[SPEAKER_08]: You did good, you did good.

1572
02:28:23,952 --> 02:28:27,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good to hear a real life experience.

1573
02:28:27,836 --> 02:28:37,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think from this, put your child on the bus tomorrow, and hopefully some more messaging will go out, especially to the area where you live.

1574
02:28:39,028 --> 02:28:41,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have another comment?

1575
02:28:41,631 --> 02:28:42,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushing, one more.

1576
02:28:45,737 --> 02:28:46,057
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.

1577
02:28:46,097 --> 02:28:46,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I give you an address?

1578
02:28:47,117 --> 02:28:47,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1579
02:28:47,437 --> 02:28:49,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrea Porcaro, 42 Guild Street.

1580
02:28:50,118 --> 02:28:52,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I just actually had a quick question about all this bus stuff.

1581
02:28:52,939 --> 02:28:53,720
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it change?

1582
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:57,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it used to be only a mile before COVID.

1583
02:28:57,181 --> 02:29:01,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mile, and then they changed it to two for COVID because of the elementary.

1584
02:29:01,243 --> 02:29:02,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a mile for elementary.

1585
02:29:02,944 --> 02:29:03,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1586
02:29:03,384 --> 02:29:04,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Two miles for middle.

1587
02:29:04,504 --> 02:29:04,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1588
02:29:04,944 --> 02:29:05,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

1589
02:29:05,385 --> 02:29:05,945
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.

1590
02:29:06,585 --> 02:29:06,845
OK.

1591
02:29:07,866 --> 02:29:09,226
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's what changed.

1592
02:29:09,266 --> 02:29:09,866
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids got older.

1593
02:29:09,886 --> 02:29:10,507
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids got older.

1594
02:29:10,667 --> 02:29:11,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1595
02:29:11,087 --> 02:29:11,487
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.

1596
02:29:11,527 --> 02:29:12,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.

1597
02:29:12,808 --> 02:29:13,268
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.

1598
02:29:15,266 --> 02:29:15,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1599
02:29:15,966 --> 02:29:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna move on.

1600
02:29:17,027 --> 02:29:18,908
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no presentations of the public.

1601
02:29:20,530 --> 02:29:22,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no continued business, and we have one new.

1602
02:29:23,692 --> 02:29:24,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're not done?

1603
02:29:27,775 --> 02:29:27,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1604
02:29:32,398 --> 02:29:33,559
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Eileen Lerner.

1605
02:29:36,261 --> 02:29:37,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, Eileen.

1606
02:29:48,458 --> 02:29:52,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle, Medford Mass.

1607
02:29:53,461 --> 02:30:11,594
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, watching this meeting is more painful than a lot of the meetings that I've watched before that have been very painful also, because to see all of you guys who work so hard to serve the city and the schools,

1608
02:30:12,735 --> 02:30:18,137
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, scrambling to solve problems that you can't solve without money.

1609
02:30:19,538 --> 02:30:24,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And from the everything you've talked about today revolves around money.

1610
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:28,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're just not we just don't have enough money.

1611
02:30:28,421 --> 02:30:32,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if we get the override, we still need more money.

1612
02:30:32,403 --> 02:30:41,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think one of the things that I'd like to see the city doing is pressuring the state to pressure the federal government to give

1613
02:30:43,471 --> 02:30:45,934
[SPEAKER_12]: the states and the city more money.

1614
02:30:47,255 --> 02:30:52,060
[SPEAKER_12]: We need more money and it's not magically going to appear.

1615
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:53,662
[SPEAKER_12]: We need it for everything.

1616
02:30:55,244 --> 02:31:02,231
[SPEAKER_12]: And for us to be looking that somehow we're going to be able to solve these problems, I think

1617
02:31:03,232 --> 02:31:05,352
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, is unrealistic.

1618
02:31:05,412 --> 02:31:07,453
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't solve them without more money.

1619
02:31:08,273 --> 02:31:19,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to thank all of you because I know from watching this how excellent all of you are and how dedicated you are to the students.

1620
02:31:20,055 --> 02:31:31,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel so frustrated that you're not able to do what you can do if you were set free with the amount of money you need to do it.

1621
02:31:32,533 --> 02:31:34,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's it.

1622
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:37,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good night.

1623
02:31:47,165 --> 02:31:48,887
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be quick.

1624
02:31:48,907 --> 02:31:55,173
[SPEAKER_18]: So Freedom Way lighting was completely replaced over the summer.

1625
02:31:55,993 --> 02:32:02,399
[SPEAKER_18]: HVAC, chilling towers serving the classrooms at the Roberts failed towards the end of last year.

1626
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:04,600
[SPEAKER_18]: We were able to get train in.

1627
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:12,122
[SPEAKER_18]: We did an emergency procurement through the city approved by the Commonwealth to have train come in to repair that.

1628
02:32:12,882 --> 02:32:14,203
[SPEAKER_18]: That chiller has two circuits.

1629
02:32:14,463 --> 02:32:15,763
[SPEAKER_18]: One circuit is functioning.

1630
02:32:16,683 --> 02:32:24,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking to the representative from train today, that circuit will be able to handle the shoulder months, he said.

1631
02:32:24,225 --> 02:32:29,286
[SPEAKER_18]: As we head into June, July, August next year, the second circuit will have to be repaired.

1632
02:32:29,326 --> 02:32:31,227
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a quote of approximately $23,000 for that at this point.

1633
02:32:33,568 --> 02:32:37,394
[SPEAKER_18]: received today, so we'll be able to really look at that.

1634
02:32:39,638 --> 02:32:42,779
[SPEAKER_18]: McGlynn water infiltration.

1635
02:32:42,899 --> 02:32:47,240
[SPEAKER_18]: So along the rear of the building, we've had a persistent issue for several years now.

1636
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,080
[SPEAKER_18]: We are seeking quotes.

1637
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:54,541
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got two in right now for repairs and construction management.

1638
02:32:54,722 --> 02:32:56,382
[SPEAKER_18]: So design construction management.

1639
02:32:56,922 --> 02:33:00,023
[SPEAKER_18]: They vary between $65,000 and $95,000.

1640
02:33:00,723 --> 02:33:05,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, another unbudgeted expense that we need to be aware of for repair of this.

1641
02:33:05,904 --> 02:33:08,045
[SPEAKER_18]: This originally came before the committee in November of 2021.

1642
02:33:10,746 --> 02:33:21,173
[SPEAKER_18]: So since March, I've been really trying to accelerate it, but there are some procurement challenges with scope and over $10,000, we need a scope for the scope of work.

1643
02:33:21,433 --> 02:33:24,095
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a chicken and an egg challenge.

1644
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:26,714
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford High School bathrooms.

1645
02:33:27,175 --> 02:33:30,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So 12 bathrooms received a facelift this year.

1646
02:33:31,678 --> 02:33:33,880
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a tile painting company come in.

1647
02:33:34,941 --> 02:33:38,825
[SPEAKER_18]: We removed the countertops and sinks, painted 12 of the bathrooms.

1648
02:33:39,665 --> 02:33:44,670
[SPEAKER_18]: We deep scrubbed and did as much as we could to get the uric acid out of the grout.

1649
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:54,079
[SPEAKER_18]: in various places and painted the bathrooms, new countertops, exactly not a fun topic to talk about, but they really do look good.

1650
02:33:54,559 --> 02:34:02,286
[SPEAKER_18]: We are really happy to provide that for our students and we hope that they provide the due care and respect throughout.

1651
02:34:03,247 --> 02:34:08,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Food services in our kitchen, we've replaced and upgraded significant amounts of equipment in the past 12 months.

1652
02:34:09,070 --> 02:34:20,196
[SPEAKER_18]: We purchased all new point of sale equipment, five new gas ovens, one new electric oven that's at the Andrews, two new ice machines, eight new milk coolers, a new steamer, two new tilt skillets.

1653
02:34:21,277 --> 02:34:24,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're currently working with procurement to purchase six new stand-up refrigerators.

1654
02:34:25,158 --> 02:34:31,739
[SPEAKER_18]: We're also working to install remote monitoring devices on our freezers and walk-in coolers in order to respond if we have a power failure.

1655
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:36,240
[SPEAKER_18]: We did suffer a power failure this summer and we lost $20,000 worth of provisions.

1656
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:41,020
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're installing these devices to make sure that that never happens again.

1657
02:34:42,021 --> 02:34:46,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cushing, before you continue, are there any questions about what Dr. Cushing has gone through?

1658
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:48,502
[SPEAKER_11]: He just did like three updates real quick.

1659
02:34:48,542 --> 02:34:48,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry.

1660
02:34:49,362 --> 02:34:49,722
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

1661
02:34:51,390 --> 02:35:01,954
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to, you know, the bathroom work is great, but we have all been to many bathrooms outside of schools, and somehow the uric acid is not what you smell.

1662
02:35:02,434 --> 02:35:11,978
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would like to hope that there's regular maintenance that can keep it from being where the grout has absorbed all the way to the board, the blue board in the back.

1663
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:19,326
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's not actually what happens in most bathrooms in most places you go to.

1664
02:35:20,046 --> 02:35:32,000
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've been to bathrooms in other schools, like at Shore, and they don't have to have people in to do that kind of work because it's cleaned.

1665
02:35:33,343 --> 02:35:33,743
[SPEAKER_19]: daily.

1666
02:35:34,424 --> 02:35:35,565
[SPEAKER_18]: That is our goal.

1667
02:35:36,026 --> 02:35:36,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1668
02:35:36,406 --> 02:35:45,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Our goal is to provide daily cleaning, close the bathrooms during the day, refresh them, and then provide deep cleaning as required.

1669
02:35:45,675 --> 02:35:53,743
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be having a training on a half day for our custodial staff, more than likely in October, on proper bathroom cleaning techniques.

1670
02:35:54,023 --> 02:35:54,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful.

1671
02:35:55,466 --> 02:35:59,087
[SPEAKER_18]: provided by our janitorial supplies company, KC.

1672
02:36:00,368 --> 02:36:11,791
[SPEAKER_18]: I do wanna say that we are also doing electric upgrades for tilt skillets, steamers, and an oven at each of the elementary schools and the McGlynn Complex.

1673
02:36:11,831 --> 02:36:16,493
[SPEAKER_18]: That work was already done at the Andrews, but we're gonna move deliberately.

1674
02:36:16,933 --> 02:36:23,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, not as quickly as we had all hoped to just do it all, but we will start replacing that equipment as we can.

1675
02:36:24,855 --> 02:36:29,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, there's further, uh, we're really excited about the menu items in food services.

1676
02:36:29,721 --> 02:36:31,082
[SPEAKER_18]: The national conference was here.

1677
02:36:31,823 --> 02:36:35,627
[SPEAKER_18]: We're bringing on, uh, veggie burgers on a more regular basis.

1678
02:36:35,827 --> 02:36:40,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Bento box, Brazilian marmita, uh, ramen noodles that

1679
02:36:40,532 --> 02:36:42,994
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say, sampled it, is absolutely phenomenal.

1680
02:36:44,095 --> 02:36:45,076
[SPEAKER_18]: It's restaurant quality.

1681
02:36:46,337 --> 02:36:54,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're very excited to welcome on board with Retta Smith, who has done nothing short of miraculous work in her year being here.

1682
02:36:54,883 --> 02:37:00,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And as we thanked other people earlier tonight, I really need to thank Retta for the work that she's done.

1683
02:37:00,668 --> 02:37:07,934
[SPEAKER_18]: We have also brought on board an assistant director, a position approved by this committee last year, Rita Toscano.

1684
02:37:08,754 --> 02:37:13,319
[SPEAKER_18]: She really brings a passion for feeding kids and feeding them really good food.

1685
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:28,654
[SPEAKER_18]: We're bringing in fresh produce from places like Little Leaf Farms, and we're trying to make our culinary experience something that kids see as a positive, not as your typical school food options.

1686
02:37:31,519 --> 02:37:31,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ryan.

1687
02:37:31,859 --> 02:37:32,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick question.

1688
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:37,582
[SPEAKER_06]: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.

1689
02:37:38,002 --> 02:37:40,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?

1690
02:37:41,444 --> 02:37:44,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.

1691
02:37:44,625 --> 02:37:47,467
[SPEAKER_18]: I can definitely talk to Director Smith about that.

1692
02:37:48,507 --> 02:37:53,810
[SPEAKER_18]: I do know that we have in the past worked with Walden Local Meat.

1693
02:37:55,231 --> 02:38:00,303
[SPEAKER_18]: And so for we will be we will be bringing that on as well.

1694
02:38:00,343 --> 02:38:02,086
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll see what we can do for our breakfast.

1695
02:38:04,783 --> 02:38:18,949
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, apparent, this was news to me because I don't follow this level of detail with food, but the USDA has regulations on the number of calories.

1696
02:38:19,289 --> 02:38:24,312
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a friend who has a son at the high school who's like,

1697
02:38:25,067 --> 02:38:36,613
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, a man, an athlete, and the same number of calories have to be given to that person to somebody like me or somebody who doesn't need many calories.

1698
02:38:36,833 --> 02:38:46,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's really kind of bonkers that like 850 calories, it doesn't matter what on earth you as a human being need is the way it has to go.

1699
02:38:46,838 --> 02:38:47,479
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, I just,

1700
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:49,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I just found this out.

1701
02:38:49,201 --> 02:38:50,984
[SPEAKER_19]: I found it rather unfortunate.

1702
02:38:51,224 --> 02:38:54,008
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's those are the USDA rules, I guess.

1703
02:38:54,289 --> 02:39:01,299
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's crazy, frankly, I mean, some of these, you know, I was not an athlete, as you probably could have figured out, but

1704
02:39:02,687 --> 02:39:09,872
[SPEAKER_19]: If I was, like, 850 calories is a snack for some of these kids, and that's supposed to be their lunch.

1705
02:39:11,112 --> 02:39:12,914
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just think it's really unfortunate.

1706
02:39:12,994 --> 02:39:13,854
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to mention it.

1707
02:39:14,515 --> 02:39:26,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure two members of the committee who are recent graduates might be able to say that five chicken nuggets and some tater tots doesn't exactly make you a great crew athlete or whatever it may be.

1708
02:39:26,762 --> 02:39:30,064
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean, we are offering the free meals under,

1709
02:39:31,265 --> 02:39:56,009
[SPEAKER_18]: you know the state's awesome program for us to be able to do that but to welcome students if you know and we're doing everything we can to make sure and director smith does does see this as an issue it's just also what we're bound to and what qualifies as a reimbursable meal which i learned that for a six-month period of time working very closely with desi

1710
02:39:57,297 --> 02:39:59,999
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, Medford High School, Missittuc and Brooks.

1711
02:40:00,759 --> 02:40:05,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Missittuc and Brooks will have their lighting upgrades completed by December 31st.

1712
02:40:06,383 --> 02:40:10,745
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a It's basically a no brainer program through national grid mass saves.

1713
02:40:11,926 --> 02:40:13,567
[SPEAKER_18]: 50% of all costs will be reimbursed.

1714
02:40:14,427 --> 02:40:18,228
[SPEAKER_18]: So the $300,000 project only costs about $149,000.

1715
02:40:19,528 --> 02:40:26,110
[SPEAKER_18]: It falls under Procurement Law, Chapter 25A, as a green energy piece.

1716
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:32,411
[SPEAKER_18]: So working with Alicia Hunt and Paul Riggi, we started to move forward on that.

1717
02:40:32,511 --> 02:40:42,774
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have phase two of lighting upgrades going throughout Medford High School, where we had very high carbon producing lights, T12s and worse.

1718
02:40:43,794 --> 02:40:46,115
[SPEAKER_18]: burning at our high school all day, all night.

1719
02:40:46,676 --> 02:40:54,920
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we're working to replace those, even though the building is sunsetting, we have an obligation to the students who are there to provide a better experience.

1720
02:40:55,180 --> 02:41:02,203
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's why we move forward with that phase two, but we will also be doing it at the Brooks and the Mississauga.

1721
02:41:02,364 --> 02:41:03,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the efficiency of this.

1722
02:41:03,784 --> 02:41:11,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.

1723
02:41:12,398 --> 02:41:14,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I have not seen that just yet.

1724
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:15,221
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying it's not happening.

1725
02:41:15,301 --> 02:41:18,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so just something to keep in mind proactively.

1726
02:41:18,685 --> 02:41:20,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1727
02:41:24,802 --> 02:41:32,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Caregiver University, we're working with the Medford Department of Health to create a Caregiver University to help support our family.

1728
02:41:32,088 --> 02:41:35,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanted to make sure you know that, that's on the enrichment side of my title.

1729
02:41:36,412 --> 02:41:41,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Technology, we purchased 950 Chromebooks for student use, 120 MacBooks.

1730
02:41:41,516 --> 02:41:49,042
[SPEAKER_18]: We're also moving to higher security so that we'll have staff have USB devices to be able to plug in.

1731
02:41:49,763 --> 02:42:00,497
[SPEAKER_18]: to their computers to be able to log on with a multi-factor authentication so that we'll be upgrading our security school committee members.

1732
02:42:00,617 --> 02:42:06,184
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll be included on any updates to that as necessary to log into your accounts.

1733
02:42:07,285 --> 02:42:09,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, security at a baseline.

1734
02:42:09,507 --> 02:42:21,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, not just because, but thanks to the mayor supporting us with ARPA funds, we've been able to replace all exterior locks, uh, and the district with the exception of the Curtis Tufts.

1735
02:42:21,118 --> 02:42:24,221
[SPEAKER_18]: The key sign out form is at the very back of this packet.

1736
02:42:24,621 --> 02:42:30,487
[SPEAKER_18]: We're being very, very prescriptive and, uh, you know, to many people's consternation.

1737
02:42:30,947 --> 02:42:32,207
[SPEAKER_18]: just not handing out keys.

1738
02:42:33,788 --> 02:42:39,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have, I wanted to provide also for you the standard response protocol this year.

1739
02:42:40,249 --> 02:42:42,390
[SPEAKER_18]: We're continuing to use this.

1740
02:42:42,410 --> 02:42:46,150
[SPEAKER_18]: It was implemented in 2023, but we added two tabletop exercises.

1741
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:50,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Those have been produced for our principals to use with their staff as well.

1742
02:42:51,051 --> 02:42:57,093
[SPEAKER_18]: A tabletop exercise allows people to go through a drill without going through and living the trauma of a drill.

1743
02:42:57,913 --> 02:42:58,293
[SPEAKER_18]: You may have

1744
02:42:58,753 --> 02:43:06,859
[SPEAKER_18]: seen recently that the New York City schools have outright banned all, um, drills because of the trauma that they can cause.

1745
02:43:07,320 --> 02:43:17,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I skipped over it in here, but starting tomorrow morning, you might see a crane in front of the McGlynn school as Gibson roofing starts hoisting the six skylights again.

1746
02:43:18,088 --> 02:43:20,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you to Madam Mayor in her office for the ARPA funds.

1747
02:43:21,210 --> 02:43:23,751
[SPEAKER_18]: to support this project to replace the six skylights.

1748
02:43:24,511 --> 02:43:27,092
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had significant water infiltration in the library.

1749
02:43:27,213 --> 02:43:30,474
[SPEAKER_18]: We will work to repair the interior space once the work is completed.

1750
02:43:31,574 --> 02:43:35,176
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're sure that everything is completely done.

1751
02:43:35,676 --> 02:43:45,540
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as positions in my area, we are actively hiring and interviewing this week and next for two custodial positions to work weekend shifts.

1752
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:52,684
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll also be looking for substitutes building monitors to fill for when those positions are absent.

1753
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:54,666
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have any questions, happy to.

1754
02:43:54,826 --> 02:43:55,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your time.

1755
02:43:57,407 --> 02:43:58,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any more questions from the committee?

1756
02:44:02,971 --> 02:44:03,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call it a no.

1757
02:44:03,892 --> 02:44:04,752
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to move on.

1758
02:44:05,393 --> 02:44:06,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1759
02:44:08,288 --> 02:44:14,073
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have one item of new business.

1760
02:44:15,474 --> 02:44:18,016
[SPEAKER_11]: It is offered by Member Ruseau.

1761
02:44:18,096 --> 02:44:22,319
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the first reading of policy AC, non-discrimination including harassment and retaliation.

1762
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:28,784
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am going to read this in its entirety because I know there's some urgency to this policy.

1763
02:44:28,884 --> 02:44:31,947
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Medford School Committee and Medford Public Schools are committed to maintaining

1764
02:44:32,627 --> 02:44:38,572
[SPEAKER_11]: an education and work environment for all school community members free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.

1765
02:44:39,033 --> 02:44:48,461
[SPEAKER_11]: School community members include school committee, employees, administration, faculty, staff, students, volunteers in the schools, and parties contracted to perform work for the Medford Public Schools.

1766
02:44:49,202 --> 02:45:07,184
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford Public Schools does not exclude from participation, deny the benefits of the Medford Public Schools from or otherwise discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, religion, disability, age, genetic information,

1767
02:45:07,925 --> 02:45:26,170
[SPEAKER_11]: active military veteran status, marital status, familial status, pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, housing status, ancestry, ethnic background, national origin, or any other category protected by state or federal law in the administration of its educational and employment policies or in its programs and activities.

1768
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:29,752
[SPEAKER_11]: This commitment to the community is affirmed by the following statements.

1769
02:45:29,832 --> 02:45:42,118
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee commits to one, promoting the rights and responsibilities of all individuals set forth in the state and federal constitutions, pertinent legislation and applicable jurisdiction, judicial interpretations.

1770
02:45:42,799 --> 02:45:54,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, encourage positive experiences and human values for children, youth and adults of all of whom have differing personal and family characteristics and come from various socioeconomic, racial and ethnic groups.

1771
02:45:54,775 --> 02:46:03,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, work toward a more integrated society and enlisting the support of individuals as well as groups and agencies, both private and governmental in such an effort.

1772
02:46:04,181 --> 02:46:10,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Number four, using all appropriate communication and action techniques to air and address the grievances of individuals and groups.

1773
02:46:11,106 --> 02:46:14,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Number five, carefully consider in all the decisions made within the

1774
02:46:15,388 --> 02:46:20,032
[SPEAKER_11]: school district, the potential benefits or adverse consequences of those decisions on human relations.

1775
02:46:20,853 --> 02:46:29,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Number six, initiating the process of reviewing policies and practices of the school district to achieve to the greatest extent possible the objectives of this statement.

1776
02:46:30,841 --> 02:46:35,404
[SPEAKER_11]: The Met for Public Schools requires all members of the school community to conduct themselves in accordance with this policy.

1777
02:46:35,644 --> 02:46:47,092
[SPEAKER_11]: It shall be a violation of this policy for any member of the school community to engage in any form of discrimination, including harassment, retaliation, or to violate any other civil right of any member of the school community.

1778
02:46:47,573 --> 02:46:52,136
[SPEAKER_11]: We recognize that discrimination can take a range of forms and can be targeted or unintentional.

1779
02:46:52,276 --> 02:46:56,759
[SPEAKER_11]: However, discrimination in any form, including harassment and retaliation, will not be tolerated.

1780
02:46:57,459 --> 02:47:20,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It shall also be a violation of this policy for any school community member to subject any other member of the school community to any form of retaliation, including but not limited to coercion, intimidation, interference, punishment, discrimination, or harassment, for reporting or filing a complaint of discrimination, cooperating in an investigation, aiding or encouraging another member of the school community to report,

1781
02:47:21,605 --> 02:47:28,808
[SPEAKER_11]: such conduct or file a complaint, or opposing any act or practice reasonably believed to be prohibited by this policy.

1782
02:47:29,529 --> 02:47:41,934
[SPEAKER_11]: There is an asterisk from an earlier list about race, race to include traits historically associated with race, including but not limited to hair texture, hair type, hair length, and protective hairstyles.

1783
02:47:43,115 --> 02:47:43,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

1784
02:47:44,861 --> 02:47:45,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1785
02:47:45,962 --> 02:47:58,834
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to warn everybody that the rest of the title nine policies which will be receiving in the coming weeks, make this look like a paragraph, and some of them are like dozens of pages long unfortunately.

1786
02:48:00,115 --> 02:48:04,899
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe we'll want to think about how we get through that in a meeting because we do have to at least read it once.

1787
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:06,361
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, for this one.

1788
02:48:06,901 --> 02:48:08,082
[SPEAKER_19]: This is one of.

1789
02:48:09,163 --> 02:48:14,104
[SPEAKER_19]: many policies that we have to, this is when we're updating for Title IX.

1790
02:48:14,804 --> 02:48:17,225
[SPEAKER_19]: All of our other Title IX policies don't exist.

1791
02:48:18,005 --> 02:48:19,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's put the past in the past.

1792
02:48:20,606 --> 02:48:21,446
[SPEAKER_19]: They should have existed.

1793
02:48:23,026 --> 02:48:25,267
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the policy speaks for itself.

1794
02:48:26,867 --> 02:48:29,428
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a number of cross-references.

1795
02:48:29,708 --> 02:48:37,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost all of those don't exist in our policy manual right now, but those are the ones that are coming before you in the coming weeks.

1796
02:48:38,150 --> 02:48:38,510
[SPEAKER_19]: That's that.

1797
02:48:39,310 --> 02:48:49,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And just for context, the Title IX regulations have changed recently, and so this is us sort of getting into line with those new regulations.

1798
02:48:51,257 --> 02:48:52,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1799
02:48:53,338 --> 02:48:54,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the first reading.

1800
02:48:55,139 --> 02:48:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the first reading by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Intoppa.

1801
02:49:00,302 --> 02:49:00,983
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1802
02:49:01,623 --> 02:49:01,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1803
02:49:02,143 --> 02:49:02,824
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1804
02:49:03,904 --> 02:49:04,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1805
02:49:09,067 --> 02:49:11,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other motions associated with this policy?

1806
02:49:12,710 --> 02:49:13,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to waive this.

1807
02:49:14,412 --> 02:49:16,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the sort of thing where we can waive the second reading?

1808
02:49:16,654 --> 02:49:21,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is very much aligned with the Massachusetts Association of School Committee recommendations.

1809
02:49:21,879 --> 02:49:23,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So motion to waive the second reading.

1810
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:25,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should do that.

1811
02:49:25,762 --> 02:49:25,942
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

1812
02:49:26,242 --> 02:49:26,543
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1813
02:49:26,623 --> 02:49:27,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Withdraw the motion.

1814
02:49:28,084 --> 02:49:28,364
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1815
02:49:28,404 --> 02:49:31,928
[SPEAKER_11]: So this will be on the agenda again next week for a final reading.

1816
02:49:33,229 --> 02:49:33,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

1817
02:49:37,187 --> 02:49:37,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there is one more.

1818
02:49:37,948 --> 02:49:38,908
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1819
02:49:39,569 --> 02:49:40,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

1820
02:49:41,050 --> 02:49:43,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Item number 2024-32, sorry.

1821
02:49:43,872 --> 02:49:45,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you ask if it was at all those in favor?

1822
02:49:45,693 --> 02:49:48,235
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't take a vote.

1823
02:49:49,236 --> 02:49:51,458
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, we did vote?

1824
02:49:51,718 --> 02:49:52,158
[SPEAKER_19]: We did.

1825
02:49:52,899 --> 02:49:53,940
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't write it down, sorry.

1826
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:54,840
[SPEAKER_11]: You said yes.

1827
02:49:55,081 --> 02:49:55,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, good.

1828
02:49:55,721 --> 02:49:57,302
[SPEAKER_11]: It's late, thank you.

1829
02:49:59,552 --> 02:50:02,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, item 2024-32 offered by members.

1830
02:50:02,714 --> 02:50:11,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So policy BEDB3 consent agenda will have grant approvals and field trip approvals added after approval of bills.

1831
02:50:13,051 --> 02:50:13,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

1832
02:50:14,071 --> 02:50:19,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, this is a relatively new thing for this committee, the consent agenda.

1833
02:50:19,314 --> 02:50:27,177
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe we just created that last year, and I believe these additional two types of approvals are things that we just approve.

1834
02:50:27,677 --> 02:50:35,321
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it was the last meeting, our meetings in June, where we're like, oh, shouldn't this just be in consent agenda?

1835
02:50:35,381 --> 02:50:37,402
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think everybody sort of thought it should.

1836
02:50:37,542 --> 02:50:40,483
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I'm suggesting we amend this.

1837
02:50:42,460 --> 02:50:43,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1838
02:50:43,521 --> 02:50:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a question.

1839
02:50:45,602 --> 02:50:45,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1840
02:50:46,042 --> 02:50:57,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip, or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that?

1841
02:50:57,589 --> 02:50:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1842
02:50:58,349 --> 02:50:59,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, I motion to approve.

1843
02:51:00,791 --> 02:51:04,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Intoppa.

1844
02:51:04,593 --> 02:51:05,234
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1845
02:51:06,534 --> 02:51:07,195
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1846
02:51:07,815 --> 02:51:08,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1847
02:51:08,336 --> 02:51:14,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of the amendment to the EDB.

1848
02:51:14,603 --> 02:51:22,551
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion to waive the second reading of 24-32 by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

1849
02:51:22,711 --> 02:51:23,392
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1850
02:51:24,073 --> 02:51:24,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1851
02:51:24,493 --> 02:51:25,194
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1852
02:51:26,035 --> 02:51:27,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Second reading is waived.

1853
02:51:29,418 --> 02:51:35,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we don't have any reports requested tonight, but we do have a number of condolences.

[SPEAKER_11]: The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Cesar A. Gomez, father of Brooks Elementary School staff member, Lauren Gomez.

[SPEAKER_21]: And about two years later, Wade actually reached out to me, because he had known me working on scholarship.

1881
02:54:58,117 --> 02:55:01,918
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was like, hey, man, I'm sorry to bother you on your personal, because it's fine.

[SPEAKER_21]: You can always reach out.

1885
02:55:10,436 --> 02:55:18,081
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.

1886
02:55:19,042 --> 02:55:22,604
[SPEAKER_21]: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.

1887
02:55:22,744 --> 02:55:29,709
[SPEAKER_21]: And I really want to make sure that I go through the proper channels and I talk with the family, you know, I could go to their door if I wanted to.

1888
02:55:29,749 --> 02:55:31,250
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, I don't.

1889
02:55:32,150 --> 02:55:33,090
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to do this right.

1890
02:55:33,970 --> 02:55:40,692
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we talked with the family and we got their approval and he went through with it.

1891
02:55:40,712 --> 02:55:41,572
[SPEAKER_21]: He was able to do it.

1892
02:55:43,072 --> 02:55:53,014
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know, making sure we care for and consider for and love one another, even when no one is looking.

1893
02:55:53,834 --> 02:55:55,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Because he didn't have to do that, but he did.

1894
02:55:56,235 --> 02:55:57,155
[SPEAKER_21]: And he made sure that

1895
02:55:58,039 --> 02:56:01,080
[SPEAKER_21]: He was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals.

1896
02:56:02,861 --> 02:56:12,625
[SPEAKER_21]: And I really just employ everyone listening, that as we sort of navigate this grief, to use the power of community and to check in on one another.

1897
02:56:14,105 --> 02:56:23,189
[SPEAKER_21]: And I employ you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.

1898
02:56:23,709 --> 02:56:27,050
[SPEAKER_21]: And to just really, really build that sense of community.

1899
02:56:27,949 --> 02:56:28,530
[SPEAKER_21]: do what we have.

1900
02:56:28,950 --> 02:56:29,491
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

1901
02:56:30,291 --> 02:56:31,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Intapa.

1902
02:56:32,313 --> 02:56:33,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1903
02:56:34,876 --> 02:56:38,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Member Branley.

1904
02:56:38,339 --> 02:56:39,080
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1905
02:56:40,161 --> 02:56:41,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody opposed?

1906
02:56:42,243 --> 02:56:42,704
