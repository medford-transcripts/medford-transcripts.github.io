7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:46,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, welcome and thanks for joining me today.

10
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:51,690
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind just starting with an introduction, so your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:55,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Daniel, for having me on the podcast.

12
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of it.

13
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:57,803
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Justin Tseng.

14
00:00:58,463 --> 00:00:59,804
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are he, him.

15
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:05,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a city councilor here in Medford, and I'm serving out my first term.

16
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:16,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the first, lucky enough to be the first Asian American elected official here in Medford, which is a great growing community, and it's great to see some representation in government.

17
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a proud product of the Medford Public Schools,

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,293
[SPEAKER_01]: After I went to Harvard for university, I came back and wanted to serve.

19
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:32,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that our city could, you know, I thought that our city was at a turning point.

20
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:35,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to capture that energy to move our city forward.

21
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:38,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been working hard ever since.

22
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:39,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Justin.

23
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll hear a little bit more about that in a minute.

24
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:48,476
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I'm going to ask you, I know you've been on the podcast before, but that was almost two years ago now.

25
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:53,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if you could share your favorite place to eat currently in Medford and what you like to eat there.

26
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the famous question of the podcast.

27
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:02,605
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such a hard one especially since we have so so many new places coming in.

28
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:07,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was trying to prep for this and it was, it was getting difficult.

29
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can't actually remember where I said last time because I feel like the answer changes every once in a while.

30
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:15,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think chili garden is always a safe bet.

31
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,050
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I've.

32
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,534
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes I'll pop over to Deep Cuts for a sandwich.

33
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:28,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I live close to Medford Square, so I'll pop over to Deep Cuts for a sandwich at lunch, or to Cuba is a great place, too.

34
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:34,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been there twice since it's opened, and I'm just trying to bring all my friends there, since it's something that we can be so proud of.

35
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been waiting my chance.

36
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:39,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks, it looks great.

37
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:40,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

38
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:47,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's always, I'm always, I always find a little chuckle when that's the question that catches people up.

39
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're right, I think over the last two years, especially lots of new spaces, and food to check out.

40
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:53,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

41
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:54,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So great.

42
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're running for your second term.

43
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you could sort of reflect on

44
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:15,925
[SPEAKER_03]: the first term kind of, you know, what you're sort of proud that you accomplished, any other sort of reflections about, you know, what, what you were able to do, what you have in the works, just sort of, you know, mentioning yourself as the first Asian American city councilor, any reflections on that, that experience?

45
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:17,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

46
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.

47
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a big question.

48
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:38,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think when I when I think about the work that I've done over the last two years, and the goals that I came into government with, I think really, I'm creating a city government that better represented people's lived experience on the ground was really central to

49
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,634
[SPEAKER_01]: central to what I wanted to do.

50
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:52,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the work that I've done, you know, when I talk about representation, it's not only about skin color or language or things like that, it's about interests, about issues.

51
00:03:53,398 --> 00:04:02,841
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was seeing two years ago was that we finally, I think, started to have this different conception of a city government as one that dared to solve bigger problems.

52
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:10,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's been an attitude in city government that hasn't necessarily tied issues.

53
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:20,047
[SPEAKER_01]: to make, I guess, to make issues more relatable to residents, to make residents feel like we're really addressing their concerns.

54
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:39,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately that's been my goal, is to communicate better, to make sure that people's, the issues that people care about, the issues that I was hearing on the doors are reflected better in the work that we're doing, both on the city council and in city government at large.

55
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:48,270
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about the work that I've done over the last two years I think I really organized them around three general principles.

56
00:04:49,912 --> 00:05:00,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all can acknowledge that we have a cost of living problem in the country and and the city government's not going to be the one to solve it but we can make people's lives easier.

57
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think about affordability, I think about rents going up.

58
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:08,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about my friends being pushed out of the city.

59
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about my own future here as someone who wants to stay but can't afford a house.

60
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:19,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about just everyday things that we can do to lower people's bills.

61
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,304
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think about the long term.

62
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:25,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about how can we make the city more

63
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:27,589
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable in the long term.

64
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:37,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, how can we make the investments into water and sewer infrastructure, how do we make the investments into our physical infrastructure to save people.

65
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,792
[SPEAKER_01]: in the long, money in the long term.

66
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:44,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Another principle I like to organize my thoughts around is sustainability.

67
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:51,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if we want to build a future built to last, we have to build a sustainable future.

68
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been really proud to get to work on the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan

69
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:11,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I'm really excited to hopefully continue that work if I get a chance, especially with zoning, because a lot of the climate goals or policy actions, especially for the city council, are zoning focused.

70
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:20,770
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also passed a number of ordinances, and we're still working on a number of ordinances that really further our climate goals.

71
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,992
[SPEAKER_01]: We've passed regulations on polystyrene.

72
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:26,653
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently working on

73
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:33,415
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf blower ordinances, we're working on tree protection as well.

74
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:39,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are goals that are going to set us up for a better future.

75
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:50,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last overarching goal, the last overarching category that I work around is this idea of inclusion and a welcome government.

76
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a lot of the work that I do behind the scenes that doesn't necessarily come out.

77
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:10,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working, hopefully, on a few draft ordinances that we can, knock on wood, task next term, if I do get re-elected, with regards to data equity, language access.

78
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:17,489
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, I've worked a lot to make sure that we're doing the most that we can given limited resources when it comes to language access.

79
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:33,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm personally helping constituents in Chinese and Spanish, languages that haven't traditionally been served by city government, working on how we can make the building of the City Hall building more welcoming.

80
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Zach talked about this on his episode, but we've spent a lot of time modernizing city council rules.

81
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:51,318
[SPEAKER_01]: making that side of city government, City Council more accessible to residents and to make the environment less hostile and more welcoming.

82
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:58,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really, we've seen a real change with people coming into City Hall, who have to come before the City Council meetings.

83
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:00,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

84
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:07,319
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically the vision, is keep pushing forward on making city government more inclusive.

85
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:25,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sent out, this year I piloted a budget survey, a feedback form basically, before we started our city council meetings on the budget to basically see where people were at, what suggestions they had for the budget, what issues they really wanted to see funded, and that was really helpful.

86
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:29,872
[SPEAKER_01]: for guiding our work and our negotiations with this current budget.

87
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:42,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I would want to expand those efforts, if given a second term, and also just to move even beyond surveys and to more collaborative more engaging forms of feedback.

88
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like that's a big, a big sort of, I don't know, barrier or like issue that I've heard a lot of is like, how do we get participation from people in the city?

89
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:58,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the thing I hear a lot about is like, we don't have a newspaper, that's a that's a big barrier.

90
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:10,680
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think that it's a question, like, I'm on the Charter Study Committee, and like the how getting people to come to our meetings, getting people to participate, what like the importance of community feedback, and how to like,

91
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,320
[SPEAKER_03]: get to the people, get to hear what they want to hear.

92
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a big issue.

93
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:27,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see that even in the last two years, that language capacity, the multilingual lines, all these things have seemed to have had some impact, but it's a big job.

94
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:29,210
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

95
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:42,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's difficult to, you know, when all the systems are built in a certain way it's really difficult to adjust them all to make sure they match the needs of a growing and diversifying city.

96
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to think about what it means for government to meet people where they are, instead of expecting people to come to government.

97
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:59,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a difficult task, given that your time on the Charter Study Committee is volunteer time.

98
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:05,104
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us and city staff, it would mean expending more time outside of our day jobs to do it.

99
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:10,665
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to help think about ways that we can do that within the scope of our day jobs.

100
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:13,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to a few candidates

101
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:30,443
[SPEAKER_01]: who are running for city council this election, some new candidates who would be interested in working with our community liaisons to reach out to our immigrant communities and hold meetings there, just listening sessions and to introduce us and what we do.

102
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:35,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be a really exciting project to work on next term as well.

103
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:38,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mayor has said that that's something that she would want to work on too.

104
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I didn't really plan on bringing this up, but I do think it's a great point that you just made.

105
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like this.

106
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:52,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a social worker, so I like hearing this sort of social worky element to city government, where really meeting people where they are.

107
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:57,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And the resource there that you're bringing up is your salaries, right?

108
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: That this is essentially, I don't know how transparent or how much people know about compensation for city council, but it's very low.

109
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially the amount of hours that you're putting into it

110
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: very, you know, almost volunteer almost volunteer time in general right so I think that, and we expect a lot of city council and they're an out of our city council members and that, you know, if this were something that people were able to make their full time job what that would change.

111
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's an interesting question.

112
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially looking at like, if we're discussing changing the size of our council, what that would mean for budgets and, and the budget seems to be a big topic that could have a really big changing the budget or increasing the budget could have a huge impact on the city.

113
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:53,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a question really, but, but yeah, I'm guessing who, who I'm asking are thinking about, like, I'm wondering.

114
00:11:54,005 --> 00:12:04,109
[SPEAKER_03]: who are kind of like your like allies or like partners in the community or like groups or commissions that have been helpful in supporting kind of your goals on the city council?

115
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to just choose a number of groups.

116
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:16,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the work we do, I mean, I would say basically all the commissions that we work with are very helpful in giving us feedback.

117
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the way I describe it is in some ways,

118
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:26,541
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs like mine, elected positions, we're expected to be experts on everything, but we can't be experts on everything.

119
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:38,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the parts of this job that I like the most is relying on experts for feedback, talking to them, asking them engaging questions, thinking about ways that we can connect different topic areas as well.

120
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:45,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, all these different activist groups, community groups become really important.

121
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:46,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much

122
00:12:47,414 --> 00:13:02,860
[SPEAKER_01]: just from talking to people and housing Medford and safe Medford and meant for people power, but also in our commissions in our human rights commissions are even things like traffic commission, and I, this is you know I think.

123
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,609
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is to synthesize all that information think about how it all works together, how we can make it work comprehensively.

124
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:19,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like it's, I think it's, that's, it's a difficult question to answer because it's so broad and I think even.

125
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:40,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Kit and Zach are Councilors that I work with all the time, but, you know, I'm working on the Youth Commission idea with Councilors Garpelli as well, and their ideas that I work on with Councilor Caraviello and, you know, these, I think the projects that I've been working on really are transcending a lot of these political lines and

126
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:55,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the same for Councilor Councilors bears and columns as well they spend so much time working with people who have very different views on issues with them I think that I think a lot of a lot.

127
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:59,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it happens away from Tuesday night meetings and so.

128
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:04,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that they deserve a lot of credit for that as well.

129
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:09,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think our job is way more holistic.

130
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's just a difficult question to answer.

131
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I appreciate that.

132
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the thoughtfulness.

133
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:24,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm hearing is it sounds like I'm always impressed whenever I meet a group from Medford or people from Medford that are involved in

134
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:28,725
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that there's like a lot of really smart people in Medford, they have great ideas.

135
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:35,031
[SPEAKER_03]: They are very like committed to the city and to sort of trying to make things work.

136
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:46,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like you're kind of like, in many ways, like translator and interpreters, like, okay, here's how city government could help you with that, or could sort of address those concerns or issues or things that you're needing.

137
00:14:47,441 --> 00:15:00,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is great, and I think that's, you know, I talked to the mayor a few weeks ago and she made some points about her hopes for just changing the culture of City Hall and it sounds like in alignment with kind of what you're saying there.

138
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:17,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think there's great alignment across you know different, I mean I think everyone notes that like a lot of us have different political philosophies when it comes to how to work in City Hall but I think something that goes a bit under kind of underspoken I guess is.

139
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:30,475
[SPEAKER_01]: just that I think there's a lot of alignment and a lot of common goals with regards to how a city should, you know, what our city goals should be, how a city should function.

140
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:41,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, the differences come in how we execute those plans and how many, how much we're ready to expend in resources towards those goals.

141
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:44,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where a lot of our debates

142
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:51,807
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, come, come out but I think there's generally just a lot of alignment that folks don't see.

143
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you're doing this job.

144
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: you're engaging with all this information every day.

145
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even if we have different ways to get to a goal, we oftentimes see very similar goals.

146
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:10,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think revenue, you talked about how the budget is always a big question.

147
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:20,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Zach's episode really talked a lot about the budget, but I think revenue is one of those examples where I think we do all see the need for more revenue in the city.

148
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have very different ways to get there.

149
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think,

150
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:30,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I believe in a certain way, a certain philosophy to get there.

151
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:36,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that our timeline is tighter than others imagine it to be.

152
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:43,036
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we can all, we are united around this goal that we really do need more revenue.

153
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we just have different ways of interpreting the plans.

154
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:54,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what something like the financial task force is meant to do is to iron out a lot of those differences and to create a solid plan moving forward.

155
00:16:55,302 --> 00:17:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and I think one element of the budget that we heard both candidates for mayor talk about in the debate was this idea of like the, how will we fund a new high school?

156
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:17,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've heard lots of different ideas about that, like debt exclusion, tax override, examining our priorities for whether or not we need a new high school.

157
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what your sort of thoughts are on that specific issue related to the budget.

158
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:30,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with the new high school, I mean, I went to that school and I think there's something to be said that we need a building that students can be proud of.

159
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:42,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking in, I love the teachers and I love my experience there, but sometimes, and I think people my age who went to that school can relate to this, you walk into the building and you're just so depressed.

160
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:48,399
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just so, you're just, it's just such, physically, it's a gloomy environment.

161
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that affects

162
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: student outcomes.

163
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:58,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that affects how teachers feel about their jobs, teacher satisfaction, and teacher retention.

164
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:07,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that the building is the reason why things are the way they are, but I do think it plays a role in it.

165
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

166
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:14,859
[SPEAKER_01]: If not for city if for city pride, we should really look at how we deal with that building.

167
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:25,609
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been telling people is that I am in favor of a new high school, I think, I think it's time, I think our current building doesn't serve the needs.

168
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,251
[SPEAKER_01]: that we see now.

169
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:47,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the report that came out after the incidents at the school, basically a lot of it was basically saying resources, there's the staff component and the physical component, and the fact that, and the staff component, you know, that's separate, that might be a conversation about an override or different revenue capacity, you know, revenue streams.

170
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:54,827
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the physical component is the fact that it doesn't align with what we need now is troubling.

171
00:18:55,727 --> 00:19:03,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a future in which maybe we salvage B building, maybe we keep parts of the building, we renovate others.

172
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we need to redo the whole building.

173
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is better.

174
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:09,273
[SPEAKER_01]: That question is...

175
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:14,478
[SPEAKER_01]: better left to the experts at the MSBA to create a suggestion for us.

176
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:21,580
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of their job, is to basically create a realistic plan in cooperation with us.

177
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,862
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, they're experts on these issues, and they can study what the needs are of the building.

178
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it'll be up to the financial task force

179
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:40,204
[SPEAKER_01]: study the issue or the funding issue more in detail.

180
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support what the task force comes up with and I be it a debt exclusion or an override but I do think it's long past the due date for change in that building.

181
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you say more about the financial task force like who's that made up of?

182
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:14,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I know the council leadership, so President Morell and Vice President Bears, they're currently working with the mayor on it, and there might be agreement on it, but this is something that was negotiated this budget season.

183
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:21,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, with the understanding that we have this need for

184
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,318
[SPEAKER_01]: a new high school building, need for new fire headquarters.

185
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,300
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these road and sidewalk improvement needs that I think we can all agree on.

186
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:48,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the reports to back them up, to basically make suggestions about the order we do the streets, the amount we expend each year on it, and this idea that next year, a lot of city and school staff are going to fall off of federal funding.

187
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:57,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, federal funding and what will end, and we have to find a way to bring most of that staff, if not all that stuff into our general funding.

188
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:04,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the financial task force is a tool that we created to basically deal with these four big

189
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,038
[SPEAKER_01]: question marks.

190
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:15,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I hear a lot about commercial revenue, which I wholeheartedly believe that we should work to improve on.

191
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:17,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of that is long term.

192
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the financial task force's goal isn't only long term.

193
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:25,186
[SPEAKER_01]: It really focuses on the short term.

194
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:32,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, before this 5 to 10 years in which new construction comes in after we do a rezoning package,

195
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,151
[SPEAKER_01]: When, you know, how do we fund these needs?

196
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:41,213
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we, how do we create something for maintenance?

197
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make sure that we can, that we can make sure that we can keep our community liaisons and business office and teachers and literacy specialists, you know, these are really important questions for us and so

198
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:00,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, I mean, I think in the long term, we're doing a lot with zoning.

199
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:16,448
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot with commercial and new housing to come in and increase basically new growth, which, as Zach said on his episode, is basically the only way that we can really increase our city revenue without an override.

200
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:20,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the question is in the short term, what's the realistic goal?

201
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,769
[SPEAKER_01]: What are realistic needs?

202
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we get there?

203
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the financial task force is set up to answer.

204
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

205
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:29,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that was new information to me.

206
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's helpful to hear.

207
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So great.

208
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:37,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's I love hearing about, you know, the past couple of years.

209
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you could think about what you would hope for in the next term, sort of what your priorities would be to keep working on or begin working on.

210
00:22:45,312 --> 00:23:02,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's, there's so much potential and I I've been working a lot on a lot of drafts of ordinances that, um, I think, well, so basically, my, what I see my first term is is setting up the foundation for a stronger future.

211
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:16,155
[SPEAKER_01]: the first term, we spent a lot of time in the council, basically doing our phase one of rezoning, which became our first reform in basically 60 years.

212
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:23,536
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent time, as I said, reviewing the Climate Action Adoption Plan.

213
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:28,878
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spent time reviewing the Comprehensive Master Plan and these open space plans.

214
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:34,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first term is really about building that foundation for us to build on.

215
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:47,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the second term to me is I'm just, I'm campaigning hard because I am very excited for it, you know, I think zoning is going to become a big.

216
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,181
[SPEAKER_01]: big area of potential that we can work on.

217
00:23:51,541 --> 00:24:04,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we, because of the high housing costs and the rental costs we really see a need for increased housing production, and the housing production plan gives us a lot of tools to do that.

218
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really proud to pass that.

219
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:15,465
[SPEAKER_01]: on it in my first term, and the second term I want to spend basically integrating those goals into our zoning plan.

220
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:17,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I think similarly with the climate plan.

221
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:22,534
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great suggestions about where to identify about how

222
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:34,057
[SPEAKER_01]: how to grow in a way that protects our climate and protects our open space, how to incentivize developers to become more energy efficient in our city.

223
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:45,801
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently passed the first reading of a new net zero energy stretch code, which basically holds our city to the highest standard when it comes to energy issues.

224
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:54,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to talk about zoning and climate because 70% of our carbon dioxide equivalents come from buildings.

225
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:01,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So zoning is something that I am really excited to work on.

226
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:11,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And something I should mention this, another way that we've set ourselves up for success in zoning is to make sure that we protect our important bus routes.

227
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the MBTAs first

228
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:30,496
[SPEAKER_01]: bus network plan for the future came out, the bus network redesign plan came out, they were basically planning to axe a bunch of routes in Medford Hillside and South Medford, and to reduce service capacity in West Medford and basically across the city.

229
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:32,758
[SPEAKER_01]: near Wellington as well.

230
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:55,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And so something that I was really proud to do was to work with community members and set up a committee, the whole meeting where we basically compiled all of these notes, all of these complaints and notes that we've had and to work with our city staff on that front to send it to the MBTA, send it to our state level elected officials.

231
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And that won us back.

232
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,551
[SPEAKER_01]: a ton of bus routes and bus service.

233
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still more work to do with it.

234
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:16,001
[SPEAKER_01]: But why bring that up in the context of zoning is because I think we can do more to develop along these transit corridors, particularly Route 16 near Wellington and Mystic Ave.

235
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:22,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And protecting those bus routes, protecting that service is really central to the development that we can bring in.

236
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:34,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I think revenue, I've already brought it up, but I'm really excited to basically continue to study this question of revenue in the second term.

237
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:46,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've been taking all these very specific small steps that we can do to expand our revenue sources and to expand our revenue stream.

238
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:56,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I, in the next term, I think we have these bigger questions of, do we need an override?

239
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:06,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Of do we, which the answer, it seems like it's a yes, but I'll defer to the financial task force on that.

240
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:13,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Of owner occupied exemptions and the economic effects that they have.

241
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically these big revenue questions.

242
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:31,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I think become central, because with these longer term goals of equity, of community development, of better schools, parks, better public services, that all kind of comes back to this big question of revenue.

243
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:40,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm also just excited to work on all these accessibility inclusion related, included

244
00:27:42,090 --> 00:28:01,398
[SPEAKER_01]: policies that I've been working on the last two years and really codifying a lot of the progress that we've made in the last two years, both regards to things like language access, with regards to community engagement, making sure that these things aren't things that become the first items that get axed when the budget becomes difficult.

245
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:10,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, those, those are basically just as I've organized my first term around this these ideas of affordability sustainability and inclusion.

246
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:19,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep working in these in terms of, you know, these values, moving forward, making sure that we are.

247
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:28,479
[SPEAKER_01]: doing actionable, setting in place actionable policies on all three of these fronts as a city.

248
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's how we can continue to move forward.

249
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:37,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of folks have seen that the city is starting to turn a page.

250
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:46,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is the time to capture that energy, to capture that, you know, all these moments of progress and turn it into real momentum for the future.

251
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:49,083
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just really excited about that prospect.

252
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:50,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's so much that we can do.

253
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:56,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can have a more ambitious city government that serves its residents better.

254
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

255
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:04,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so the theme of the podcast is hoping to center around the equity and inclusivity.

256
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:10,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you could say a little bit more about those ordinances that you're working on or hoping to get passed in the next term.

257
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

258
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:17,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we, I'll start with the ordinances that I, um, that we have before us on the city council right now.

259
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:33,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, um, on Tuesday, October 24th, we're going to be working on, um, two ordinances, basically one on a youth commission to make sure to basically, um, empower youth.

260
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:48,005
[SPEAKER_01]: to make policy recommendations to city government, to give us their perspective on issues, to give us an idea of what programming they would like to see, and how we can better integrate youth into

261
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:53,146
[SPEAKER_01]: into our city government basically.

262
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:58,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Youth Commission is something that's really close to my heart.

263
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:04,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's something that Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Unite have been really passionate about as well.

264
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,651
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gender Equity Commission is the other commission ordinance on that agenda.

265
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:22,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an idea that Councilor Morell worked on even before she became a city councilor and something that she was really eager to get done and which kind of just stalled in committee and flamed out.

266
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:25,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring that back and bring back those efforts.

267
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:33,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to basically study these ideas of gender intersectionally.

268
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:35,966
[SPEAKER_01]: gender identity, gender.

269
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:41,629
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it affects our city processes, how it affects city hall.

270
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:49,335
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make our city better prepared to deal with the intersectional aspects of gender?

271
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:51,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's coming up this week.

272
00:30:52,038 --> 00:31:03,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also working on a welcoming city ordinance that basically codifies our city's policies with immigrants and a police cooperation with ICE.

273
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:06,510
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that, you know, it's really about

274
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:16,600
[SPEAKER_01]: making permanent what we already have to give folks in our community more peace when it comes to these issues.

275
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:24,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something that I've heard from folks in the Hispanic community is that they actually don't know that we have our current non-cooperation policy with ICE.

276
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:30,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they can be wary of city government when

277
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:35,806
[SPEAKER_01]: they realize this non-cooperation policy is theoretically not permanent.

278
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:45,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And so codifying it, I think, is about giving folks peace and to make them feel safer in city hall and more willing to engage with city services.

279
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:52,730
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, there are cities around us that have been working on language access ordinances.

280
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the big question that I've been working on is how do we write that ordinance with the resources that we have.

281
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:04,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's something that we can set into place and increase.

282
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:20,936
[SPEAKER_01]: the scope of our the capacities of our city government with regards to language access, I know there, we've done a lot of work, especially with regards to these core immigrant languages that are immigrant immigrant community speaking, but we have

283
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:31,591
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of languages that are left out as well and I think having a comprehensive process to basically provide those services or to provide alternatives to what we currently have that helps those immigrants.

284
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:37,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I think will is really important data equity is another one where.

285
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:59,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is very policy wonkish, but this is an issue that comes out of a lot of Asian American Pacific Islander activists where, particularly in our community, outcomes can be so, so different for different issues within our general racial category.

286
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:08,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think data equity is about using better data that is more specific and doesn't treat

287
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:16,916
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one racial group as a monolith and having that inform our work, and in so doing also making our city services more efficient.

288
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:29,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, that's another kind of inclusion oriented ordinance that I would want to work on and pass in a second term and I've been kind of talking to state level activists and

289
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,432
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators about what this might look like.

290
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:40,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And they finally got something passed at the state level, which means that something at the local level can now move faster.

291
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really exciting stuff.

292
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for working on that.

293
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super exciting.

294
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it wouldn't be possible without the residents of the city.

295
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Medford is such a

296
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:58,727
[SPEAKER_01]: is so, I think, ready for inclusion and diversity and equity these ideas.

297
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:12,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have had our fair share of, you know, moments when it comes to these issues in the past, but having, you know, been working in this sphere in the last two years I've

298
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:34,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Medford is in such a prime spot to move on these issues, and that the residents of our city are so ready to to get these kind of these goals across the finish line to make sure that these aren't just you know these, the words aren't just a slogan for diversity that we actually implement policies that address that question.

299
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:40,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're such a unique community in that sense.

300
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:45,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends who are doing this in other cities, and this work is just really difficult for them.

301
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:46,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much pushback.

302
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:54,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Medford, I think if we do get any pushback, a lot of it is decent questions about how do we implement it.

303
00:34:54,703 --> 00:35:00,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's as much just challenging the goals of equity and inclusion.

304
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:03,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we're really lucky to be living in a city like Medford.

305
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure, yeah.

306
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:10,452
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's exciting to think about what can happen in the next couple of years with all this energy.

307
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm wondering if there's anything else that you want to mention or plug before we wrap up for today.

308
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:27,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um, my website has more information about the work that we've been doing this past term, and the, the platform I'm running on going forward to be reelected.

309
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:34,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can visit the website at www dot Justin for the number for Medford calm.

310
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:41,217
[SPEAKER_01]: The accomplishments and plans page has a lot of information.

311
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:50,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into very specific details about housing, environment, inclusion, education, all these issues.

312
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:59,465
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much that I wish I could mention on this episode that inevitably slips my mind or we just can't fit in.

313
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:03,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And so please check out that part of the website.

314
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:13,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also created a map of all the funding decisions are almost all the funding decisions we've made and how they will affect you on a local level on a street by street level.

315
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's its own tab.

316
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,419
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Justin for Medford.com backslash.

317
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:40,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's backslash EN for English backslash map, but it's a tab on my website as well that you can check out, you can see how the important decisions that we've taken on the city council last two years, a lot of it was contentious, how those decisions have affected you on a very local level.

318
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:48,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I also if you know I, I'd be remiss if I didn't plug the volunteering in the donations.

319
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:51,673
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, you know, every campaign season is difficult.

320
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all running very people centric operations, which relies on the work volunteers and

321
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:02,234
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes really expensive.

322
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:03,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Even local elections can be expensive.

323
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:10,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd be remiss not to plug those two things, which you can also find on my website.

324
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:17,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And please feel free to follow me on my social media at justin4medford, again, the number four.

325
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:21,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.

326
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:26,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to post as many updates from the city council as I can.

327
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:29,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been finding that it's helpful to

328
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:45,651
[SPEAKER_01]: to basically like explain what we're doing on the city council to explain the votes that we've taken on there and every I try to do this more often sometimes they can't but I try to post council updates on on those pages for people to see what we're we've been up to.

329
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:47,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And those updates are appreciated.

330
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:54,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely a benefit of having some younger folks on the City Council to translate those things into social media for us.

331
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:55,975
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you, Justin.

332
00:37:55,995 --> 00:38:00,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being here with me today and good luck in a couple weeks.

333
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for inviting me.

334
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:04,296
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you for all the work you do.

335
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:14,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as you said before, there's really a lack in media knowledge, in media, local news in Medford.

336
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:29,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunately common across the country nowadays, but there's so much important work that we're doing, so many important issues that we're debating, that we want to get residents to give us their input on.

337
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:38,065
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts like this, I think really help, you know, just reach out to more residents.

338
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:40,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

339
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, happy to do it.

340
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:41,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Preston.

00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:52,113
