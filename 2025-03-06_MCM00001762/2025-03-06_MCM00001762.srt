[SPEAKER_03]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

36
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:15,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Agenda item number three is the MSBA Accelerated Repair Statements of Interest, SOI.

37
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:31,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent, and this is concerning the district's intention to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority MSBA accelerated program on behalf of the Roberts, the Misituck, and the Brooks Elementary Schools.

38
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:40,272
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford School Committee is hereby asked to approve 3 separate motions hereby authorizing the administration to formally submit the statement of interest

39
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:57,140
[SPEAKER_04]: for the schools listed below under priority five, replacement, renovation and modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in school facilities.

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is the Roberts Elementary School roof and heat pump.

41
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:12,422
[SPEAKER_04]: two is mr tuck elementary school roof and heat pump and brooks number three is brooks elementary school roof and heat pump dr cushing i don't know if you have anything to add before we take votes and discuss

42
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:24,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I know just appreciate the committee's consideration of that this this window is open now until March 21st and then we anticipate will be closed for approximately 2 years.

43
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:33,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is an opportunity to at least get into the pipeline and have the opportunity to make decisions as we move forward with these 3 schools.

44
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:58,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and then so the general public's aware this is the same process we took just a different category under MSBA as it relates to the work we're doing for the new high school which we're now excited to share last week that we're in the feasibility study so this is just the first phase of trying to get that

45
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: portion of these projects paid for through the MSBA.

46
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:07,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank all that are working on these applications from the chair.

47
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:13,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Needed projects, of course, is one that has to worry about city and school budgets.

48
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:28,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work that we are doing on our HVAC and our high school and now these roofs, never mind city side projects, but definitely getting at least 50% reimbursement is something that you just can't pass up trying to do when you have buildings that are

49
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:36,316
[SPEAKER_04]: 25 years old at this point and you know their roofs are at the life expectancy or going to be there shortly.

50
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

51
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

53
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:45,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an exact set of language that I should have the motion?

54
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why Member Graham has her hand up?

55
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:49,869
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my question.

56
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

57
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:54,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is.

58
00:04:54,788 --> 00:05:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, this language that you shared with me, I'm just going to pop in the chat.

59
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:01,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

60
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to read it out loud.

61
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:18,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the other piece of context for all of this, just so that if anybody else is listening besides the committee that's sort of been through all this with us, when we looked at the capital plan, which we approved back in December,

62
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:21,484
[SPEAKER_02]: December, I believe it was December.

63
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:32,407
[SPEAKER_02]: In that plan, we made recommendations to pursue these accelerated repair applications when the window opened.

64
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:49,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at that time, what we did know is this window is open again for the first time in a while, or I think it was open last year potentially, but was closed to us when we would have needed to use it for

65
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:53,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the McGlynn Andrews project and.

66
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:57,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The MSBA is doing a lot to try to combat.

67
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:05,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the sort of skyrocketing cost of construction across all of their projects, which is what led to them freezing this program.

68
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:06,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is.

69
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:13,671
[SPEAKER_02]: seems like it's the first program to freeze when something happens that is unexpected.

70
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:23,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad that we have this window open, that we might be successful with one or multiple of these projects.

71
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:35,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at best, if everything goes as planned, this will not come around again for two years, which means we would not know an answer for three years, which means we're probably looking at

72
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 years from now that these things would be repaired and replaced.

73
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:57,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am really worried based on what I hear about the things like the roofs and the HVACs from the process that we've been going through with McGlynn and doing these mini assessments to figure out how to submit these applications that.

74
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometime between now and 5 years from now, like, we are going to be looking at all of these projects as non optional projects.

75
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:15,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know Dr Cushing has been really hustling to get this done in collaboration with some of the team that is working on McLean Andrews.

76
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And just sort of trying to position us to take advantage of a potential grant.

77
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:25,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you, Dr for for doing that.

78
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will, I'll read this and I will also pop it in the chat.

79
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:51,798
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just real quick, but if I can apologize for interrupting this language that is going to be read is extraordinarily specific and prescribed to the largest extent where specific things have been put in around the priority, the address of the school, things like that.

80
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:58,464
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, the language is prescribed by MSBA and specifically taken from their resources.

81
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:05,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, which made it really easy, so I didn't have to come up with this on my own.

82
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:29,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will make a motion that reads, having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford School Committee of the City of Medford, in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances, has voted to authorize the superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts School Building Authority the statement of interest form dated March 2025 for the Roberts Elementary School

83
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:34,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Located at, um.

84
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the exact address?

85
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:37,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe 35.

86
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:41,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, thank you.

87
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Court street, Medford mass.

88
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:57,034
[SPEAKER_02]: 02155, which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which the application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

89
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Priority five, replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old, and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology.

90
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:13,967
[SPEAKER_02]: This work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford,

91
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:20,171
[SPEAKER_02]: As both the heating and c are in various states of the cooling systems are u temperature for staffs an to function at maximum le roof is showing signs of

92
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:53,607
[SPEAKER_02]: and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, or commits Medford Public Schools of the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

93
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And here it comes in the chat.

94
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:07,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I am forever grateful you didn't expect me to type that up as it went, since you went.

95
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:09,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not letting me send it.

96
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's too long.

97
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:19,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a limit.

98
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham, would you like me to share the document with members?

99
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:28,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

100
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

101
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It is in a document, so what I just read, we can share with you if that works.

102
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:45,748
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

103
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

104
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:51,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless that's a problem because I have a child with the Roberts, but I assume that's fine.

105
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's fine.

106
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Branley?

107
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:57,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

108
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Grant?

109
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

110
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very top.

111
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, never a party.

112
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, never I don't.

113
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, never say yes, maybe a local current.

114
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a student at the Roberts, but I'm going to vote in favor of all three.

115
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, 70 affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

116
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:23,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Mr. Tuck next.

117
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, each one is.

118
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Tuck elementary roof and heat pump is next.

119
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming same sort of resolution?

120
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the same exact resolution.

121
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I can read it again.

122
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:48,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Having convened in an open meeting on March 5th, 2025, prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford City Council of the city of, sorry, this is the wrong one.

123
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:49,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

124
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the wrong place.

125
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:51,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

126
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooks.

127
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

128
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Medford School Committee of the City of Medford, in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances, has voted to authorize the superintendent to submit the Massachusetts School Building Authority Statement of Interest Form dated March 2025 for the Mississauga Elementary School, 37 Hicks Avenue, Medford, Mass.

129
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:28,090
[SPEAKER_02]: 02155, which describes and explains the following deficiencies and priority categories for which an application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

130
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Priority five is replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems.

131
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:38,253
[SPEAKER_02]: including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old, and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology.

132
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: The work is being undertaken by the school district in partnership with the city of Medford as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure.

133
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:53,437
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for staff and students to function at maximum learning capacity.

134
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:56,418
[SPEAKER_02]: The roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness.

135

[SPEAKER_04]: National programs member Rousseau.

137
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the document that seem to be duplicates for each school.

138
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:36,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's because there's votes that have to be taken by the Council as well so you just need to go to the school committee section.

139
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

140
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second it.

141
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by member Graham seconded by member Ruseau.

142
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:44,823

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

145
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:50,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

146
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:50,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

147
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:51,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

148
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:51,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

149
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:07,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And onto number three, which is Brooks Elementary School roof and heat pump.

150
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

151
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:13,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an open meeting on March 5th, 2025.

152
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:31,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to the SOI submission closing date, the Medford School Committee of the city of Medford, in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances, has voted to authorize the superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts School Building Authority a statement of interest form dated March 2025 for the Brooks Elementary School located at 388 High Street, Medford, Mass, 02155.

153
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:41,610
[SPEAKER_02]: which describes and explains the following deficiencies in the priority categories for which an application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

154
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:51,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Priority five is replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems, including the roof, which is approaching 25 years old, and the HVAC systems with heat pump technology.

155
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:58,502
[SPEAKER_02]: This work is being undertaken by the district in partnership with the city of Medford, as both the heating and cooling systems are in various states of failure.

156
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:05,261
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, the cooling systems are unable to maintain a comfortable temperature for students and staff to function at maximum learning capacity.

157
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:18,137
[SPEAKER_02]: The roof is showing signs of deterioration and wetness, and hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or approval of an application.

158
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: the awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School Building Authority or commits the Medford Public Schools of the City of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

159
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:34,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

160
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:38,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

174
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:56,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

175
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:58,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

176
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

177
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

178
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:02,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

179
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:15,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a note for everybody that these do also need to be approved by the council and Dr. Cushing is working on a submission to them in time for their meeting next week.

180
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

181
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

182
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:28,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have the fiscal year 26 budget areas of chapter 90 revolving funds, enrollment projections, and class size.

183
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:31,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll turn it over to our budget analyst, Mr. Gerald McHugh.

184
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

185
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:42,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to attempt to share my screen.

186
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we go.

187
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,112
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom right, Jerry, next to the slider.

188
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

189
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always started.

190
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:05,494
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

191
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you see it OK?

192
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:07,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

193
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:11,237
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

194
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So for this meeting, I'm going to

195
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:39,943
[SPEAKER_07]: give an overview of what we found for enrollment, projections for next year, how that translates in the class sizes projected, a brief overview of chapter 70 budget and kind of how we divided up the override questions.

196
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm gonna go through

197
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:53,473
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of the initial asks from all the principals and directors in the school system.

198
00:17:53,573 --> 00:18:11,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's gonna be a lot there, and the bottom line's gonna be a little eye-popping, but we're not suggesting that we're gonna attempt to fund everything that was asked for, but we do wanna encourage principals and directors to,

199
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,557
[SPEAKER_07]: not be shy about stating what they think they need for their program.

200
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerry, do you want us to save questions till the end?

201
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:36,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I did allow for some time for questions at the end, but I suppose if there's need for clarification that it might make sense to interrupt.

202
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, while I'm here, will we get a copy of this?

203
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was in our, great, thank you.

204
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we'll get it up on the website tomorrow.

205
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:54,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're predicting an increase in kindergarten enrollment.

206
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, that's just a best guess.

207
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:03,088
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did note that there was 699 births in Medford for the year.

208
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,275
[SPEAKER_07]: that the kindergarten class is entering.

209
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:21,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I took an average of the percent of births in the prior three years that translated into kindergarten enrollment.

210
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I made my projections based on that.

211
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:33,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we'll of course keep an eye on that, you know, through the registration process.

212
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:43,884
[SPEAKER_07]: but we are proposing to have sufficient teachers to handle that increase in enrollment.

213
00:19:47,727 --> 00:20:00,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So the enrollment by grade, it's somewhat stable, although there's been this history in recent years where one kindergarten is high and then the next year the kindergarten is low.

214
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:04,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as these grades progress through the elementary,

215
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:12,884
[SPEAKER_07]: there's ups and downs, but we'll get to the total enrollment and it's somewhat stable.

216
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:32,881
[SPEAKER_07]: This will necessitate principals to kind of move their teaching staff around because some, you know, they might've had four grade twos this year and they only have three grade threes next year, but one of those,

217
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:41,760
[SPEAKER_07]: second grade teachers will probably have to move to grade three, unless they still needed four in grade two.

218
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've accounted for that.

219
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:52,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's your middle school grades and the high school.

220
00:20:57,804 --> 00:21:01,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I took a cut by school as well.

221
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:02,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

222
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And Roberts is really large.

223
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we should be keeping an eye on.

224
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:19,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And the rest of the schools are pretty close to what they had this year.

225
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:26,459
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of that increased kindergarten enrollment is driving up that number for them slightly.

226
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And then here's the middle schools are pretty,

227
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:46,242
[SPEAKER_07]: stable and then the high school we expect will increase a little bit because of the ninth grade coming in and the Curtis Tufts will be somewhat stable this year.

228
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:57,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really depends on, that's based on students we know about and there could be other students assigned to Curtis Tufts during the FY26 school year.

229
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And then these are the totals for the last three years.

230
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:20,002
[SPEAKER_07]: actual as of October 1, and then based on the October 1, 24 enrollment, we use that as a baseline to form a projection for FY 26.

231
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So about, you know, 34

232
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: students with let's see it's an increase of about 65 students 34 is from that kindergarten enrollment 23 is from the high school and then the rest is kind of sprinkled around throughout the the remaining schools.

233
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:54,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did we did class size you know after I got some feedback from the principals this year we we changed a little bit how we're doing class size

234
00:22:55,998 --> 00:23:05,484
[SPEAKER_07]: because I wasn't originally taking into account students that are mainstreamed in specialist classes.

235
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So we tried this methodology this year where we took the number of regular ed grades in the school for a particular grade and then divided it by the total student enrollment.

236
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will make sure that they,

237
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,740
[SPEAKER_07]: specialists will have a reasonable caseload.

238
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:39,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And these, I think, compared to other school districts I know about, these are pretty generous class sizes, I think.

239
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:52,794
[SPEAKER_07]: But Chapter 70, as we found out, kind of the basis for the override was the conclusion that the

240
00:23:53,865 --> 00:24:09,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Chapter 70 budget and Chapter 70 state, the foundation budget and the Chapter 70 state aid really do not provide MedFed with the funds they need to run their district.

241
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll, there's a, right now this is based on the governor's budget.

242
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:19,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Chapter 70 for MedFed will increase by $338,000.

243
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:37,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's based on, many school districts actually get the minimum state funding, they don't qualify for Chapter 78, as is the case with MedFed.

244
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:46,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So, typically, governors have begun this process by giving $30 per student.

245
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:51,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Governor Healey constructed her budget based on $75 per student.

246
00:24:54,885 --> 00:25:04,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And if my memory serves, last year at the conclusion of the state budget process, it was up to about $104 per pupil.

247
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:16,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully that number will rise and give the city a little bit of extra funding to offset their appropriations school department.

248
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:18,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary?

249
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:19,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

250
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:25,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see the question from the mayor, but should that actually say FY25 and FY26?

251
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:32,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't know if that was, sorry.

252
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

253
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:39,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because you said it will be going up, so I thought FY25 were finalized.

254
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:49,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I used last year's template, and I did forget, but I'll fix that at the end of the,

255
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:51,165
[SPEAKER_07]: presentation.

256
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:51,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

257
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:52,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

258
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:53,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

259
00:25:55,947 --> 00:26:12,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then we we had the ballot questions this year and thanks to the voters of Medford coming to the rescue providing seven million dollars in additional budget authority for for Medford Public Schools.

260
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:19,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Question seven provided three million dollars for kind of general school expenses

261
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:32,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And $4 million was dedicated towards the creation of a high school schedule along with providing funds for teacher and paraprofessional compensation.

262
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:46,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So how this got divided up is we were grateful to the mayor and the city council who advanced one

263
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:57,774
[SPEAKER_07]: million, $750,000 to the school department to kind of finalize our school budget last year.

264
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And it prevented further cuts.

265
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can remember there were a lot of cuts that had to be made in last year's budget.

266
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city was willing to take a risk and provide those funds up front and hoping that the override would pass, which it did.

267
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So of the $7 million,

268
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:27,718
[SPEAKER_07]: that 1.7 was retained so it could go to fund the amount of money that the city already provided to the school department.

269
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And that left $5,250,000 to add to the budget.

270
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically this year we're working with a budget of $83 million.

271
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:53,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And last year, I know the school committee was very interested in some of the special revenue funds that we have.

272
00:27:53,310 --> 00:28:00,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna try to quickly go through the list of these items.

273
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:02,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have federal grants.

274
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:10,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see, I have a column for FTEs funded, and I haven't got to that yet.

275
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:14,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But particularly with the federal grants,

276
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Those grants are at risk, as many of you are aware.

277
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:31,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really have to get a handle of who we're funding off of these grants and just be prepared in the event that funding is cut.

278
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:38,333
[SPEAKER_07]: But that will be part of the budget narrative when you get the budget document.

279
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,655
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have our ESSER group, Title I, Title IIA,

280
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:50,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Title one is for reading and math instruction.

281
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Title two A is professional development and maybe, is it class size?

282
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use it for class size reduction.

283
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Title three is for our EL program.

284
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:08,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have this student support, academic enrichment.

285
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:14,739
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Saturday Academy, terrific, okay.

286
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:19,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the VOTE program has the Perkins grant.

287
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:26,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Special Ed has the IDEA.

288
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:38,011
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a significant special needs population, which is why this amount is so high, and this fund teaches and supports special needs.

289
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:47,687
[SPEAKER_07]: medical contracts, other types of contracts that are needed for special needs students and out of district tuition.

290
00:29:51,710 --> 00:30:01,596
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a new IEP being mandated to be implemented, so we did receive some funds to implement that new IEP.

291
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:05,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we get a separate IDE

292
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:10,361
[SPEAKER_07]: IDA funding that supports the preschool program.

293
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:33,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we got this year, we got Vacation Acceleration Academies and Molly Lorden spearheaded an effort to take advantage of a cybersecurity grant that was available earlier this year.

294
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,627
[SPEAKER_07]: and we in fact were awarded it.

295
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:47,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Our health services department receives comprehensive school health services grant from DPH.

296
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:58,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we are a fiscal agent for Medford Family Network and they receive a federal grant, Coordinated Family and Community Engagement.

297
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have a small grant to support

298
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:14,315
[SPEAKER_07]: proficiency outcomes for our EL students, and then the state kicked in another $5,500 for that federal grant that we got.

299
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:33,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We also qualify for reimbursement for a portion of our out of district tuitions and transportation over a certain amount

300
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:45,886
[SPEAKER_07]: any tuition that's over a certain amount of money that's based on your foundation per pupil amount, 75% of that difference is eligible for reimbursement from the state.

301
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:57,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So our special education department prepares an initial claim every year, and then we get reimbursement based on that claim.

302
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:01,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the last quarter, there's a reconciliation

303
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:10,124
[SPEAKER_07]: to get the actual student costs lined up with what we already received.

304
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:16,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also get reimbursed for our homeless transportation.

305
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:31,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've never budgeted this, but this year I wanna utilize some of these funds to offset our homeless transportation budget, so I think we can free up

306
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:50,020
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe 300,000 or all the way to 391 to kind of offset the homeless transportation in the general fund and that provides us a little bit of relief to address other needs in the budget.

307
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:59,704
[SPEAKER_07]: We have private grants, we have the Crystal Campbell Betterment Project, Cummings Foundation,

308
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:09,131
[SPEAKER_07]: provides money for the Center of Civic and Social Responsibility.

309
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:15,015
[SPEAKER_07]: They also receive donations from the public, so that's in our third account.

310
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:21,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a scholarship in the memory of Leah Kalleri-Clark.

311
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: We help the Medford Education Foundation manage the distribution of funds to our

312
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:37,744
[SPEAKER_07]: teachers that apply for grants through the Medford Education Foundation.

313
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:46,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Another private grant is Children's Trust for Medford Family Network.

314
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:55,051
[SPEAKER_07]: That is in the deficit, but it's mainly, we're still kind of unraveling accounting problems with that.

315
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,232
[SPEAKER_07]: They have several,

316
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:05,752
[SPEAKER_07]: several pots of money, and then they have people could be funded over two or three different pots.

317
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:12,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's not executed perfectly, then you can get this situation.

318
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:17,695
[SPEAKER_07]: But this grant is well managed by the person that's assigned to it.

319
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:22,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will, I'm not concerned about that right now.

320
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, these funds,

321
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:37,280
[SPEAKER_07]: are only through the end of February and it's being compared to a full year's worth of funding from FY24.

322
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:44,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Midford Family Network also does some fundraising and that goes into their gift account.

323
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:55,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the school department receives gifts and donations at various times and it goes into this account

324
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,045
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.

325
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for our revolving funds.

326
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

327
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify, that's the balance, right?

328
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the spending on it?

329
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's not the spending.

330
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:11,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

331
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:13,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what's available after the spending.

332
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:14,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

333
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:21,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm happy to, you know, maybe at a different time, we could kind of take a deeper dive into

334
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: the revolving funds and we could get, I mean, I have a history of revenue and spending for each of these accounts.

335
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure that was.

336
00:35:34,524 --> 00:35:36,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not the spending, that's a good question.

337
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:49,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing about revolving funds is that the expenses hit right away, but the revenue typically lags because of reporting.

338
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes through a lot of,

339
00:35:52,143 --> 00:36:02,191
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of fees come through the website, and then they have to be downloaded here at the school department, prepare a report that has to go up to City Hall.

340
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:09,756
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall has to match it up with a deposit they received, and then it gets into the admin system.

341
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:19,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So the revenue does lag behind, and the balances at the end of the year will reflect all the revenue that was collected.

342
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

343
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:36,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of these, I mean, you're familiar with the early education program in Medford is fee-based, school lunch is fee-based.

344
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Those balances are down mainly for the reason that I talked to you about it, but it's also the

345
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:52,637
[SPEAKER_07]: The school lunch director is really doing a good job replacing equipment and updating equipment, utilizing those revolving funds.

346
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,462
[SPEAKER_07]: School athletics, driver's ed.

347
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:03,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We charge students if they break their Chromebook or they lose their Chromebook.

348
00:37:07,786 --> 00:37:16,068
[SPEAKER_07]: At one time, we accepted students from out of district down at the Curtis Tufts, and we charged tuition.

349
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:27,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do still have balance in that account, which we use to charge one of the individuals teaching their kid's corner.

350
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's a situation where the revenue lags.

351
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,212
[SPEAKER_07]: the actual spending.

352
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:50,382
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's another thing that we're working on right now is that we've always had this practice of holding slots for employees.

353
00:37:50,462 --> 00:38:02,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes if you have a very efficient, soon-to-be mom, she's on the phone four or five months ahead of when she needs it to make sure she gets a slot.

354
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:08,981
[SPEAKER_07]: the budget is really based on almost full utilization of all the seats.

355
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:15,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's creating a little bit of a problem with the revenue projections that we're trying to address now for next year.

356
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:17,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary.

357
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

358
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, member Ruseau.

359
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:21,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

360
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:28,117
[SPEAKER_01]: The short tuition going up is confusing, because I didn't think we had shore occupying any classroom.

361
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:31,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So was there money that shore owed us and we just got it?

362
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:40,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it went in, what typically happens when you have out of district students in your district, you can set up a revolving fund.

363
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is a balance from back in the day when we collected tuition for those students.

364
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And little by little, we've been kind of spending it down.

365
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:55,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So you see, it goes from 176 at the end of 24,

366
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:05,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It's down to 98 as of February.

367
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's an error.

368
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,652
[SPEAKER_01]: The 176 is 17,000, 176,000.

369
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:13,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that should be a comma, yeah.

370
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry, I was confused by that.

371
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:16,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

372
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Good catch.

373
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,663
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no more revenue coming into that account.

374
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:28,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also the same for vocational tuition as well.

375
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:34,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last student that we have from out of district is a senior this year.

376
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:43,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, we have the before and after school program, the Edgeley Field.

377
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:49,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, these next two accounts, one, you know, in community schools,

378
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when the decision was made, but it was before my time, but I'm sure it was necessary to get through a tough budget year.

379
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:10,548
[SPEAKER_07]: But the director of athletics and his administrative assistant are charged to community schools.

380
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:20,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could have been that there were like sufficient funds in that year to be able to do that.

381
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:29,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the Director of Athletics does have a responsibility for scheduling the people that rent our school buildings.

382
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:38,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really unsustainable because we don't have the rent coming in to cover those salaries anymore.

383
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:47,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think what we'll try to do before the budget is finalized is figure out some kind of allocation method where it kind of makes sense

384
00:40:48,833 --> 00:41:05,338
[SPEAKER_07]: for the director to be charged a portion to Edgeley Field, a portion to community schools, and a portion to the general fund, and the same for his administrative assistant, and that will provide some relief to this revolving fund.

385
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:16,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the pool, they're doing a little bit better, as you can see from the deficit is going down, but we did

386
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,889
[SPEAKER_07]: change the rates at the beginning of the year, so that's helped.

387
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:41,124
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that I've done, one thing that also may be unsustainable in the pool is that the use of the pool by our own students is important, but right now it's being absorbed into this fund, which doesn't have the money.

388
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can either, so right now,

389
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:55,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I directed the pool director to fund the chemicals that are used in the pool.

390
00:41:55,587 --> 00:42:01,612
[SPEAKER_07]: We're funding those out of the facilities department right now to kind of compensate for the school use.

391
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:12,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But going forward, we might have to figure out some kind of allocation on the general fund to support the pool.

392
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:14,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally,

393
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:21,947
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Family Network also has a revolving fund that they call the Parent-Child Account.

394
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:31,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to, that was a lot, do you wanna, let me see.

395
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:37,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're gonna get into kind of all the different asks in the next few slides.

396
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:40,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we wanna stop and entertain any questions so far.

397
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:46,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question from the chair if I don't see any hands raised.

398
00:42:47,892 --> 00:43:03,163
[SPEAKER_04]: In the CFO world and maybe the superintendent too, where are we at with the federal uncertainty and how are schools taking that into account in budgeting?

399
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I know us mayors are talking about it.

400
00:43:08,513 --> 00:43:25,587
[SPEAKER_04]: on the city side mainly, but I have recently learned that there's a city or two that are nervous enough to be, is gonna be, you know, affecting their budgets.

401
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:33,814
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just didn't know where we are, because you did have a slide with all the federal monies and grant monies that come in, and I just, is there any of them that are,

402
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:41,759
[SPEAKER_04]: of concern, are we hearing any word on any of them that they might be cut or reduced or anything like that?

403
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so we can keep an eye on it.

404
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard any specifics.

405
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:50,303
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely have to keep an eye on it.

406
00:43:52,764 --> 00:44:02,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to budget some money in undesignated salaries to maybe address three or four positions.

407
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:21,685
[SPEAKER_07]: What's unclear is whether the grants are going to be completely eliminated or are they simply eliminating the bureaucracy and giving the money or some portion of the money directly to the states.

408
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:27,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we'll just have to see what direction they go in.

409
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:32,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, these are grants that affect

410
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:49,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Every community, red states, blue states, urban, rural, it's just, there'll be a lot of pushback, I think, if this attempts to cut them completely, so.

411
00:44:51,840 --> 00:45:03,522
[SPEAKER_07]: When you hear about cutting, eliminating the Department of Education, it's possible that these programs will just move over to the United States Treasury and will be dispersed from there.

412
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want to say?

413
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I was only going to just follow up.

414
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:14,047
[SPEAKER_06]: The title grants are the ones that fall under ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act.

415
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:28,842
[SPEAKER_06]: They are the ones that are linked to the competency determination and our compliance with making sure that we are compliant to the state standards and frameworks.

416
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:37,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now for Title I in Medford, we are using it solely for early literacy and reading skills at the elementary level.

417
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:43,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And to Jerry's point, Title II is a lot around professional development and learning.

418
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:47,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We do fund some consultancies in there.

419
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of that funding is used to help us continue our partnership with Hill for Literacy.

420
00:45:54,324 --> 00:45:56,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Title III, as he said, is through Paul Teixeira.

421
00:45:56,865 --> 00:46:05,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Title IV is a lot of stipends and use to, as it's stated here, support students.

422
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:12,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of our fiscal 25 funding went to help with the High School Saturday Academy.

423
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:21,829
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that I would say, there's definitely a lot of conversation going on, a lot of monitoring of the current situation.

424
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:31,492
[SPEAKER_06]: There has been no change, but there is definitely some rhetoric around maybe, you know, just fear.

425
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:37,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And if districts and states are not compliant with federal mandates,

426
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: and executive orders, you know, the threat is that this is the type of things that they will remove from funding districts federally.

427
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:54,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, it warrants monitoring, but at this time, there's no change.

428
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:59,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Guzzi.

429
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:00,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Graham?

430
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:05,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

431
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:20,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I saw I got a couple of questions related to this from a constituent and on the same day, I saw 1 of our representatives post about this very topic.

432
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:24,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just dug up her post and I'm going to put it in the chat.

433
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:29,730
[SPEAKER_02]: To sort of frame, like, how does money come to us?

434
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:35,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's very little money that comes directly to us directly from the feds.

435
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:40,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just thought this was like a helpful context.

436
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's too big.

437
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:47,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to give you the Facebook link, I guess, because I can't give you the whole quote.

438
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:48,062
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

439
00:47:53,689 --> 00:48:02,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I find her to be very helpful and factual in her understanding of how school funding works.

440
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:08,819
[SPEAKER_02]: She's sort of a legend in Massachusetts, and she should be in a much more broad way than that.

441
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that will actually take you to her post.

442
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:20,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me, I will send it to you all separately.

443
00:48:20,302 --> 00:48:26,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And her name is Tracy O'Connell Novick, and she is a wealth of information.

444
00:48:26,265 --> 00:48:33,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can happy to read it to you all, but she basically, she says,

445
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:41,533
[SPEAKER_02]: that something I see a lot, perhaps, of people perhaps simply not knowing how federal aid to school districts works.

446
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:45,756
[SPEAKER_02]: In the vast majority of cases, federal aid to school districts goes through state ed agencies.

447
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some exceptions, and this doesn't, for example, speak to DOD schools or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

448
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Districts are not on their own, though, for the most part.

449
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:57,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Your federal aid is conditioned on written agreements between the state and federal governments.

450
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:04,651
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no TAP that runs directly to your school district, and thus, this isn't every little school district's fight.

451
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the world changes like every minute right now, but, um, that is helpful context.

452
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:26,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so for all of our like wishes about, um, what Desi might do differently in the world right now, I think we're, we're all on that same side.

453
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:29,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

454
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:37,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But just point, I mean, I do think that's important to also note, though, because there is a difference, right, between competitive grants and non-competitive grants.

455
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And most, not all, but like most of these grants that Jerry is highlighting, we are, we receive an allocation based on our demographics, our enrollment.

456
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:56,840
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're kind of assigned the amount that we have to work with and budget for in the various categories.

457
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

458
00:50:04,804 --> 00:50:04,984
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

459
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:15,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted just to give you an idea of what the principals and program directors have been asking.

460
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:27,352
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made some tentative decisions on things we might include in the budget, but it's very limited right now.

461
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:37,225
[SPEAKER_07]: We know we're gonna have, we have to provide a reserve for our collective bargaining agreements.

462
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:50,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have teachers, we do have staff that are under agreement with the collective bargaining that will have an increase next year.

463
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:51,674
[SPEAKER_07]: That has to be accounted for.

464
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:55,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people have step increases

465
00:50:56,807 --> 00:51:00,648
[SPEAKER_07]: or a lot of people have step increases that also have to be accounted for too.

466
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:06,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So once that's taken care of, then we can kind of address some of these other needs.

467
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is kind of right now where I'm at.

468
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a handful of budgets that I really haven't gone through with a fine tooth comb.

469
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:23,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep in mind that

470
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers that you're looking at is not a budget number.

471
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:32,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the increase over FY25.

472
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:44,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're anticipating we'll have to increase our reserve for expiring collective buying agreements by 1.3 million.

473
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,357
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already plugged in FY26 salaries for everybody.

474
00:51:55,633 --> 00:52:08,003
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are under a collective bargaining agreement in FY26, we used whatever's proposed for that employee for FY26.

475
00:52:08,103 --> 00:52:19,892
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're not, we're using their current amount, and those funds are provided on that first line under our reserve.

476
00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:34,285
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a handful of unforeseen expenses that we had to add to FY25 after the budget was approved, and I'll go through that list with you.

477
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:51,130
[SPEAKER_07]: We have tentatively sought to include some new spending, and then I'll go through the list I want to see just to give you an idea of what's being asked for.

478
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:59,255
[SPEAKER_07]: is kind of to be determined that totals 2.7 million right now.

479
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, there's no expectation that we're gonna be able to fund everything that was asked for, but all the expenses will be evaluated.

480
00:53:12,508 --> 00:53:13,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the ask it may,

481
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:22,836
[SPEAKER_07]: behoove us to wait until a new school schedules are established.

482
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to switch to a different spreadsheet.

483
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to stop sharing this one and

484
00:53:53,643 --> 00:54:13,278
[SPEAKER_07]: No Sorry the wrong one Here it is Okay, so

485
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:18,608
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a new spending that we've included so far.

486
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:24,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we kind of reserve the right to take some of these off if we have to to balance the budget.

487
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:33,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do want to increase our capacity in our tech area.

488
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:42,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We identified this year every single software application that we're using

489
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:50,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And it totals close to $800,000 worth of annual licenses.

490
00:54:51,989 --> 00:55:05,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know that our students and staff are using a lot of this technology for research, for instruction, for professional development.

491
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:18,406
[SPEAKER_07]: for, you know, keeping track of our students with demographic information, keeping track of their grades and things like that.

492
00:55:18,546 --> 00:55:23,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we have to have a reliable network.

493
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:30,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And what this will do is that the kind of the network support is within

494
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:46,360
[SPEAKER_07]: the group of people that are under Molly Layden that support the school, the teachers and the students with getting their computers running, their printers running.

495
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So we intend to keep those, that same number of positions.

496
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:59,622
[SPEAKER_07]: This gives us an extra position that can deal exclusively with network issues and we'll be able to serve

497
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:09,526
[SPEAKER_07]: the staff and students better in the school with the complement of staff that we have there.

498
00:56:10,386 --> 00:56:18,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have aging servers and uninterrupted power supplies.

499
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:28,640
[SPEAKER_07]: These power supplies would keep our computers running in the event of a power outage and a lot of them don't work or they're beyond their

500
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,863
[SPEAKER_07]: their life expectancy.

501
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:42,047
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a separate project going to replace air conditioning that's in the computer rooms at each school, too.

502
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of those are out.

503
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:54,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, that creates a very risky situation when those rooms heat up too much.

504
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We do think we've

505
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:13,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We have sufficient teachers to implement those class sizes that I showed you earlier, except we would need another elementary teacher at the Brooks.

506
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:27,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of a little bit back and forth whether we should hold back on that and wait until we get closer to the start of the school year to see if those additional students materialize, but right now we're

507
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:32,561
[SPEAKER_07]: suggesting that we want to go forward with that position.

508
00:57:39,505 --> 00:57:47,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a meeting with the principals and we went over the number of teachers they have per class.

509
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know there was a concern with the miss attack.

510
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:57,097
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, that will be on the list that I showed you, but all the

511
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:06,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe all the teachers that the principals need in the elementary schools are provided for in the budget right now.

512
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can go, if you wanted to see kind of details about how many classrooms we have at each grade at each school, we can certainly go through that at another time.

513
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:32,803
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a language director asked for a stipend to provide a French II course.

514
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:37,624
[SPEAKER_07]: An existing teacher would pick up an extra section to do that.

515
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:41,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, with the new schedule, there may be no need for that.

516
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:43,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be able to be absorbed.

517
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,846
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll keep an eye on that.

518
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:50,367
[SPEAKER_07]: When we approved our,

519
00:58:52,012 --> 00:59:05,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Compensation plan for hourly rates, we identified security monitors as a possible, security monitor substitutes as a possible need.

520
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:18,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So this will provide a small budget, at least initially, if we utilize a daily sub for security monitor.

521
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:29,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're expanding the number of students that can take the PSAT, sophomores and juniors.

522
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:37,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that all sophomores and juniors, I think, are contemplated to take the PSAT next year.

523
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:42,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that requires an increase to that subsidy of $2,000.

524
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: The current budget's $4,000.

525
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:56,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Now for budget adjustments, these are, let me see if I can make this a little bigger.

526
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:14,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are things, you know, for operations we had because of, we had students move into the district.

527
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:19,771
[SPEAKER_07]: that required one-on-one paras that come to the district with IEPs.

528
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:33,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had to put on three one-on-one paras at the Mississauga and an additional special ed para at the Roberts.

529
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:42,143
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, we currently fund lunch monitors in the lunch fund.

530
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,729
[SPEAKER_07]: which is not appropriate.

531
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:52,073
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get written up by DESE if we haven't already done so.

532
01:00:52,173 --> 01:01:01,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll propose to bring those salaries onto the general fund.

533
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We have two pieces of software that are no longer eligible for grant funding that are integral to our instruction.

534
01:01:12,933 --> 01:01:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: One is ST Math software and the other is the map assessment program that we will have to provide for in the general fund next year.

535
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:41,543
[SPEAKER_07]: This year to deal with vacancies and illnesses at the vocational school we added

536
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:53,962
[SPEAKER_07]: a building sub, although no, we added an academic lead, I think, to support the vocational program.

537
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:59,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is working very well right now.

538
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:05,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're proposing that we add that to the budget next year when we fix it.

539
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:17,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have frequently used daily subs in the health services program, but we don't really have a budget for that.

540
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:24,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna establish a budget in FY26 for those needs.

541
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:37,210
[SPEAKER_07]: For security monitors, one security monitor was added this year because we have one night shift

542
01:02:37,624 --> 01:02:52,569
[SPEAKER_07]: building monitor at the high school, and we weren't able to provide that building monitor with a work-free dinner at the appropriate time.

543
01:02:54,089 --> 01:03:05,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We also had some concerns with coverage over on the pool side, on a door on that side, so we added a building monitor for that purpose.

544
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:19,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in reviewing the staff, so we take a kind of look, we look at, you know, the FTEs that were authorized in FY25 versus what we actually have in the payroll.

545
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:24,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And a additional security monitor popped up at the high school.

546
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:32,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So, through miscommunication, I think, that a position got filled that didn't really exist.

547
01:03:34,303 --> 01:03:41,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We're kind of evaluating, you know, how we want to deal with that second position right now, but one is definitely needed.

548
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:54,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, as I said, we went through all the instructional software that's used throughout the building and throughout the school system, and these

549
01:03:57,145 --> 01:04:13,735
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as these became available, my guess is that people would just kind of figure out accounts they already had that they might have some slack in a particular year to fold in software.

550
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes it was charged to textbooks.

551
01:04:18,598 --> 01:04:22,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it was charged to instructional supplies.

552
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes to contract services.

553
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:32,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But for end-of-year reporting, it should be reported under a category that's called instructional software.

554
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:45,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've identified all those, and for what we need to get those accounts right-sized, we would have to add $58,000 to various accounts over the course of the year.

555
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: school system to make sure that software is fully funded.

556
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:00,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

557
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:05,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerry, if I may ask a question.

558
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I know every year the city adds like a position or two and then the schools is moving things around and maybe does the same, adds several positions.

559
01:05:18,112 --> 01:05:24,356
[SPEAKER_04]: This year we're adding quite a few more than that obviously because of the overrides.

560
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:35,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you budgeting it all on the school side for the 20,000 plus per person it costs for insurance or is that something that would be doing on the city side?

561
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:43,505
[SPEAKER_04]: just pointing it out, because I know this whole site alone is 11, maybe 11 and a half million for insurance.

562
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:44,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

563
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:54,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that, well, I think that the practice here, Mayor, is that that was always accounted for on the city side.

564
01:05:56,312 --> 01:05:59,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we could have a conversation if you wanted.

565
01:05:59,814 --> 01:06:03,156
[SPEAKER_07]: These people are already on the payroll, so they're already baked into FY25.

566
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:07,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on this page.

567
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, this page and I know there's been a few others with new proposed positions.

568
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I think it's gonna be more than usual with the override.

569
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to point that out because it's just a large expense for a city and school that we, yeah, I think we do take on the city side.

570
01:06:25,508 --> 01:06:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know if you were budgeting that 20,000 or so or more per person per new hire.

571
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:35,394
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not yet, but you would have the increase in the chapter 70

572
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,151
[SPEAKER_07]: to help support that.

573
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:58,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think at the end of the day, the question eight was really to address compensation, so not to add people.

574
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:05,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And then question three, I mean, question seven, the three million,

575
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:10,106
[SPEAKER_07]: is basically stabilizing some of these budgets.

576
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:22,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is how we're fully funding our instructional software and looking at facilities maintenance and the needs of our technology.

577
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:33,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you'll find that we're not really in a position to add a lot of new staff in my mind right now.

578
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:34,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

579
01:07:40,065 --> 01:07:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I wanted to just kind of give you an idea of what the principals and directors were asking for.

580
01:07:51,692 --> 01:08:02,258
[SPEAKER_07]: At the high school, the principal would like to start, oh, she asked for funds for Acceleration Academy, and I think we have that covered.

581
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:04,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that covered in the grant?

582
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a Saturday.

583
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:08,282
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saturday Academy has been, yes.

584
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:09,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Not this.

585
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:11,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the Acceleration Academy.

586
01:08:11,413 --> 01:08:16,816
[SPEAKER_07]: She's very interested in establishing an alternative program at the high school.

587
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:26,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And this program would be similar to the Curtis Tufts, but different from the Curtis Tufts.

588
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:37,788
[SPEAKER_07]: These would students that don't have identified special needs, but need smaller groups and kind of a little extra therapeutic support.

589
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And she does have a grand vision for this program, but what we are looking at is kind of more or less a pilot and start out with a small group of students and see how that works out.

590
01:08:57,714 --> 01:09:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'd be a lead siteman attached to kind of take care of some administrative duties within that approach.

591
01:09:08,485 --> 01:09:22,176
[SPEAKER_07]: more funds for the summer school, an advisory curriculum, I guess this would be a curriculum committee for SEL, whiteboards.

592
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:30,262
[SPEAKER_07]: She'd like to add funds for bathroom duty, but that's something that I haven't taken a look at yet.

593
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:57,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll see, she asked for a number of positions which are listed under the directors, but our teacher, band teacher, which we took care of in the supplemental theater teacher, three world language teachers, and we'll give a few more details in a minute on those.

594
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And then two engagement specialists,

595
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:09,578
[SPEAKER_07]: that would support working with the students and address attendance and behavior.

596
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:18,060
[SPEAKER_07]: At the Vogue program, we more or less took care of a lot of the asks through the supplemental.

597
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:29,763
[SPEAKER_07]: He is looking for an assistant due to increases in his program, enrollment in his program.

598
01:10:31,517 --> 01:10:35,899
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody to help out with the administrative duties at the vocational school.

599
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: The Andrews principal asked for a full or part-time special ed reading teacher and was looking for either a para or a behavior specialist to run a in-school suspension program with a restorative practices curriculum.

600
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:11,680
[SPEAKER_07]: At the McGlynn, we did talk about the administrative assistant position, and that got added in the supplemental.

601
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:20,044
[SPEAKER_07]: He is also looking for funds to utilize a guidance Councilor to help with the schedule over the summer.

602
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:26,127
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mississippi asked for a grade two, which we've provided for.

603
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:36,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The Roberts was looking for a special ed reading teacher, a BCBA, and a math interventionist.

604
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:46,323
[SPEAKER_07]: The ELA director asked if we'd consider two literacy interventionists at each middle school.

605
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:55,207
[SPEAKER_07]: The world language director was interested in restoring one Spanish teacher that was cut in 25.

606
01:11:57,455 --> 01:12:12,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And then adding a second Spanish teacher to expand offerings and to, sorry, there's a typo there, but to create a sign language strand within her department as well.

607
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:22,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the extra section for French too, which we've tentatively signed off on.

608
01:12:23,824 --> 01:12:24,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we,

609
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:33,284
[SPEAKER_07]: For math, we have this ST Math that we're bringing into the general fund next year.

610
01:12:34,304 --> 01:12:51,768
[SPEAKER_07]: She did offer to reduce her supply line because based on her needs, they're well, they have less of a need for textbooks and supplies because of the technology that's used.

611
01:12:54,789 --> 01:13:07,132
[SPEAKER_07]: The athletics, I haven't been able to go through, and I will within the next few days, but they've been typically running over their budget.

612
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:23,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna look at how we can structure that account to figure out what are we gonna charge to the athletic revolving fund, and then what do we wanna provide for in the general fund budget.

613
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:35,776
[SPEAKER_07]: The Food Service Director provided for new appliances at the various schools and she has sufficient funding in her evolving fund for that.

614
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:41,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Visual and Performing Arts would like to add an art teacher.

615
01:13:42,379 --> 01:13:49,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this was kind of thinking similar to world language that there might be a need for more

616
01:13:51,266 --> 01:13:58,469
[SPEAKER_07]: more of these types of sections when the new schedule gets created, but that I think is to be determined.

617
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:02,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We restored the band teacher at the high school.

618
01:14:04,431 --> 01:14:17,956
[SPEAKER_07]: She also asked that the theater teacher be restored, and have a part-time elementary band teacher, and then increase her supply line

619
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:23,618
[SPEAKER_07]: by $4,000, which I think has merit.

620
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:43,112
[SPEAKER_07]: At the buildings and grounds, when we finally settled the Teamsters contract, we were able to add two swing-stiff custodians, and that's been helpful in keeping the overtime down.

621
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But the budget had already been passed,

622
01:14:47,808 --> 01:14:51,430
[SPEAKER_07]: by the time that labor agreement got worked out.

623
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:56,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So we added those in the supplemental along with an assistant director for buildings and grounds.

624
01:14:57,714 --> 01:15:11,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And we still have to do some analysis on the cleaning contract, the maintenance lines and the utility lines to make sure that those are sufficiently funded.

625
01:15:14,085 --> 01:15:16,287
[SPEAKER_07]: In curriculum instruction, we talked about

626
01:15:17,863 --> 01:15:34,826
[SPEAKER_07]: the MAP and the ST Math, that MAP is really should be 38,000, I think, not 45, but all this will continue to be gone over before we finalize the budget.

627
01:15:37,326 --> 01:15:45,248
[SPEAKER_07]: For special ed tuition and transportation, we kind of got lucky, there was a,

628
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: increase of about $600,000 in special ed tuition.

629
01:15:51,975 --> 01:16:08,800
[SPEAKER_07]: But because we did not use all our circuit breaker money this year, we have some bandwidth to offset those increases with circuit breaker money that we will receive in FY25, and then some we'll receive in FY26.

630
01:16:15,912 --> 01:16:26,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now I have this line item as being level funded, but it really would have put a hole in the budget if we had to come up with that.

631
01:16:27,777 --> 01:16:40,063
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a number of new students this year that came to the district that needed an outside placement, but we do have a couple of residential placements that are aging out next year.

632
01:16:40,103 --> 01:16:41,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So that helped.

633
01:16:43,884 --> 01:16:45,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with transportation.

634
01:16:46,290 --> 01:17:02,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my guess on how this happened, but as I was going through the budget this year, well, again, I'm thinking about yellow bus.

635
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:10,121
[SPEAKER_07]: So for special ed, we had a significant increase this year.

636
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:15,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next two years are smaller increases.

637
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:40,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We entered into a three-year contract with North Reading Transportation, and we'll be able to utilize some balances in Circuit Breaker to offset those increases in Special Ed Transportation, which as of a couple of years ago, the Circuit Breaker

638
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:43,916
[SPEAKER_07]: now takes into account transportation as well.

639
01:17:43,996 --> 01:17:47,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So transportation is eligible for that reimbursement.

640
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:56,587
[SPEAKER_07]: The special education department has a program that they call project transition.

641
01:17:57,328 --> 01:18:04,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's for students that have completed high school but will still be with us until they turn 21.

642
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:07,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they've never really had

643
01:18:07,935 --> 01:18:09,016
[SPEAKER_07]: a budget to work with.

644
01:18:09,797 --> 01:18:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: They've kind of cobbled together different amounts of money from different sources, including parents' generosity, et cetera.

645
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:27,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So this year we decided it's very small money for a very worthwhile program.

646
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:33,255
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll continue to provide for that in FY26.

647
01:18:33,315 --> 01:18:33,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And the

648
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:45,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Director at the Curtis Tufts asked if she could have her own supply budget, which is fine.

649
01:18:45,937 --> 01:18:52,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's short money, but it kind of gives her a little more ownership to meet her needs.

650
01:18:53,862 --> 01:19:04,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, she would just typically go to the special ed office and try to get what she, try to get funds from

651
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:08,597
[SPEAKER_07]: the administrative office for her supplies.

652
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:24,951
[SPEAKER_07]: She also asked that if we could make sure, it was always intended that the floater would provide some administrative support to the director.

653
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:32,418
[SPEAKER_07]: But what was missing was a consistent day during the week where she could kind of rely on that person to come down.

654
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:37,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to work out the scheduling of that so we can make that happen.

655
01:19:38,767 --> 01:19:49,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the special ed director wants to review the access program at the McGlynn Middle to look at staffing.

656
01:19:49,775 --> 01:19:56,100
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some concerns with possibly growing enrollment in that program next year.

657
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And

658
01:19:58,803 --> 01:20:04,688
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have more special needs students that require year-round programming.

659
01:20:04,788 --> 01:20:15,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So the budget, which is around $280,000 right now, is projected to increase to about 330, some odd, in 26.

660
01:20:16,517 --> 01:20:18,438
[SPEAKER_07]: The EL program is fine.

661
01:20:25,548 --> 01:20:39,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, to your earlier question, this is another area that we have to look at because of the nature of that program and the families that are coming to MedFed to be in that program.

662
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:51,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you remember last year, we had a significant EL enrollment in kindergarten in FY24, and we provided for two

663
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: EL teachers at grade one to accommodate those students.

664
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:12,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking with the director, we'll move that second teacher into grade two for next year, and then we'll keep an eye on enrollment as we go forward.

665
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:21,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The health services, we did add a nurse in the supplemental,

666
01:21:23,055 --> 01:21:33,199
[SPEAKER_07]: They were requesting a health record system that is really good.

667
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:39,442
[SPEAKER_07]: The designers of the system like to say, made by nurses for nurses.

668
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:49,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And that this is gonna help a lot with the reporting that they have to do with DPH because the software is,

669
01:21:51,996 --> 01:22:18,409
[SPEAKER_07]: uh designed to do that and we'll get um that this in the first year of this grant the the cost of the application and the um implementation so there's a lot of work that needs to be done to integrate uh this application into the school brains system um and then we will have to pick this up in fy27 it will no longer be grant eligible

670
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:31,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she did ask that her laptops be refreshed with MacBooks, and we completed that a couple of weeks ago, at least completed the ordering.

671
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:33,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going forward this year.

672
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:47,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Guidance requested that the two Councilors cut at the middle school be restored, possibly add a

673
01:22:48,364 --> 01:23:05,749
[SPEAKER_07]: college and career Councilor maybe as a stipend position, but somebody that could take the lead on the needs of those students that require those services.

674
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:13,192
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about adding to the PSAT subsidy.

675
01:23:14,508 --> 01:23:22,514
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of students can pay for their own, but some students need a little bit of support in order to take that, and that support comes out of this account.

676
01:23:26,276 --> 01:23:44,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she also, I don't know if you're familiar with recovery high schools, but they're a little bit like a special needs outplacement, but they usually have students that are referred that have substance

677
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:55,937
[SPEAKER_07]: issues and I don't think we need to put a placeholder in because I think we'd probably be able to cover it, but it is expensive.

678
01:23:57,897 --> 01:24:03,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But we haven't, there hasn't been a need for that for the last couple of years either.

679
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:14,043
[SPEAKER_07]: The director of library media suggested that we hire a district-wide library assistant.

680
01:24:15,428 --> 01:24:25,956
[SPEAKER_07]: A few years back, the assistants accepted in the high school were eliminated in favor of having full-time librarians in each library.

681
01:24:26,997 --> 01:24:39,247
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is some need to collect books and get them back on the shelves and log in.

682
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:56,472
[SPEAKER_07]: new books, some kind of like low-level administrative duties that could support the librarians and takes time away from their teaching assignments and other things they have to do in the library.

683
01:24:58,574 --> 01:25:06,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So for other operational, we are looking at a position to kind of provide leadership in the technology area.

684
01:25:07,677 --> 01:25:35,212
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is something that we still haven't fully figured out, but our technology is kind of spread over different departments and it really needs to be organized in the same way facilities is organized so that people can be making sure that servers are refreshed on a timely basis.

685
01:25:36,602 --> 01:25:37,683
[SPEAKER_07]: power supplies.

686
01:25:40,004 --> 01:25:51,252
[SPEAKER_07]: We are up to date on the latest releases for security reasons, so that is under discussion.

687
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:57,036
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some discussion earlier, do we need to somehow support

688
01:25:58,624 --> 01:26:02,705
[SPEAKER_07]: our diversity needs in the school department.

689
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:14,468
[SPEAKER_07]: We rely on the city in their person, and so we're taking a look at whether it makes sense to have our own or work something out with the city.

690
01:26:18,449 --> 01:26:20,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I said before, the community schools,

691
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:39,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Without the Edgley account being involved, it would cost $127,000 to kind of allocate two salaries on a 60-40 basis, 60% to the general fund.

692
01:26:39,525 --> 01:26:49,287
[SPEAKER_07]: But I need to sit down with the athletic director, kind of get a better handle on the time he spends in each of these programs.

693
01:26:51,981 --> 01:27:00,926
[SPEAKER_07]: At the beginning of the school year, we established a city year program in two schools.

694
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:08,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're thinking about whether or not we should continue those programs into FY26.

695
01:27:11,912 --> 01:27:19,256
[SPEAKER_07]: We did, as happened last year, we had, in order to deal with a severe,

696
01:27:21,128 --> 01:27:30,644
[SPEAKER_07]: budget situation in FY 24 there were a number of paras that was shifted to the before and after school program and

697
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:44,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It really, you know, that's not, it's something that was necessary to do that year, but we should be working to undo that and get those people back on the general fund.

698
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:51,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that through attrition, we've kind of whittled it down.

699
01:27:51,285 --> 01:27:57,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's 17 paras that are on this revolving fund, so,

700
01:27:58,782 --> 01:28:07,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be that we don't need to move five, but we should probably try to move a couple at least and kind of keep an eye on that in the future years.

701
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:18,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've talked about as part of overall technology organization, whether we have a need for a high school registrar.

702
01:28:18,575 --> 01:28:23,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was one at the high school a few years back, but

703
01:28:25,215 --> 01:28:33,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I think our position right now is we're going to wait until we have a vacancy in our data reporting position.

704
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:44,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to get that filled and get that person up to speed so that person could support a new registrar if we wanted to go forward with that position.

705
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:52,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So does anyone have any questions?

706
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:55,519
[SPEAKER_07]: on that list of where we're at.

707
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:08,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill, thank you so much for the presentation, Mr. McHugh.

708
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:10,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Very detailed.

709
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:11,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the committee?

710
01:29:11,848 --> 01:29:14,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, we can move on to our last agenda item.

711
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:20,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a sixth affordable housing trust meeting as well, so just throwing it out there that I have to leave around six.

712
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:30,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's no questions, thank you for the presentation and I think you said you were going to send it to us by email as well so that we have it and can further review.

713
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:31,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

714
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:35,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Will we get this list that you just went through here as well?

715
01:29:35,797 --> 01:29:38,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really helpful to see what people want.

716
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:40,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let me see.

717
01:29:40,659 --> 01:29:42,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of embedded in a

718
01:29:42,992 --> 01:30:08,684
[SPEAKER_04]: large spreadsheet but i could probably print it out and you know pdf it and even just this tab i think would be really helpful yeah great thank you so much hearing and seeing no further questions thank you mr mccue we're going to move on to number five which is our executive session portion on motion to enter into executive sessions pursuant to mass general laws 30a section 21a

719

720
01:30:20,892 --> 01:30:28,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, the Medford School Committee will be discussing ongoing collective bargaining negotiations with administrators and the Medford Teachers Association.

721
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:31,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to enter executive session?

722
