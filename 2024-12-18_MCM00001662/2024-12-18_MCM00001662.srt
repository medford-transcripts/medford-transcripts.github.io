1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:04,914
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the public meeting of the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for 12-18-24.

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll come to order and we have an agenda to follow.

3
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria, I didn't see any minutes.

4
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:19,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't expect them because you've been slammed between the renewals and all the other year-end paperwork.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can push that off till next month.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Commissioner Allen,

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,523
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanted to do that approval?

8
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's take the first item on the agenda.

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:38,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at it.

10
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:42,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the liquor license and the entertainment license.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So I motion to approve the surrender of Chili Gardens liquor license and entertainment license, which was at 41 Riverside Avenue, Medford.

12
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,500
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't see anything.

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, was it just that they're just closing their doors?

15
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:02,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what we sort of know?

16
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:10,509
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, yeah, somebody's taking over, but she didn't want to do a transfer from what I understood.

17
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I asked her a couple of times, are you doing a transfer?

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,371
[SPEAKER_07]: She said, no, we're closing our doors at the end of the month.

19
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:18,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was pretty much it.

20
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:22,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody is going to be taking over, but I'm not sure on the details or any of that.

21
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to go back and see when we issued that.

22
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a year ago or 18 months ago?

23
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember when we issued that?

24
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:32,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.

25
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:38,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, when it got taken over by a new, when it got bought.

26
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:39,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

27
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

28
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:47,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess there's no reason to not approve the surrender of that license.

29
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:51,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just encourage whoever the new person is to

30
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: to reapply as soon as possible.

31
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

32
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fine.

33
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that.

34
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:01,531
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

35
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,211
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

36
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:03,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

37
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:04,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

38
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:05,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

39
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:06,312
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

40
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing and hearing none.

41
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:09,653
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

42
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:10,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passed.

43
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:17,556
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good that in a way that they surrendered it so we don't run into the same problem that we did with the porch.

44
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:23,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No license on that address, so now there's no problem.

45
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they came to me and she did whatever I told her to do, so she was very good about it.

46
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:33,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Good advice Daria, very good advice.

47
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:39,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right, so why don't we get right over to Snappy Patty's.

48
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:52,292
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a representative, Adam, from Snappy Patty's and we, let's see, let me just get my stuff up here and all that.

49
00:02:53,704 --> 00:03:03,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're going for a application of additional forms of entertainment on their entertainment license.

50
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, can you basically just give us a rundown of what we're trying to do here?

51
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

52
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, some of our patrons have asked us to do like a trivia night.

53
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,953
[SPEAKER_01]: We might do one every two weeks.

54
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:23,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how that would play out here.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,849
[SPEAKER_01]: From time to time, we have private parties, people want to have their uncle sing or do karaoke or something like that.

56
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, I'm just jumping through the hoop.

57
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:39,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not interested in having a rock and roll band till 1am or any of that.

58
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,910
[SPEAKER_01]: a hoopla, we're a small family restaurant in the neighborhood.

59
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:52,615
[SPEAKER_01]: At best, maybe we would have a classical or some sort of folk night, or maybe a year-end poetry reading with the high school.

60
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, but this is not for a rock and roll license.

61
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for entertainment to go within the town.

62
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:05,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what our space could possibly host would be trivia night.

63
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:07,145
[SPEAKER_01]: At best, maybe a comedian.

64
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,524
[SPEAKER_01]: or a small acoustical one-person ensemble.

65
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:13,487
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.

66
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is guest-driven.

67
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,350
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not anything that we're looking to mastermind.

68
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

69
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:19,672
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

70
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:35,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Darrier had sent us over a copy of the application and I don't see really any issues with it.

71
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:43,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the building department and the Board of Health hadn't signed off on it, but where you had,

72
00:04:44,252 --> 00:05:06,283
[SPEAKER_06]: um by devices only before that was initially inspected by at least the building department so um if signatures are on the way that's fine um you also had a inspection from the building department for your section 12 license um before it was renewed so we know that um

73
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:11,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, your premise is okay, or especially by devices.

74
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not worried about those 2 signatures.

75
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get input from my fellow commissioners.

76
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:24,255
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I didn't say, and what we'd like you to do is just send us.

77
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:32,084
[SPEAKER_06]: A handwritten sketch, we don't want anything from an architect or anything, of just where the entertainment will be in your restaurant.

78
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:40,192
[SPEAKER_06]: A sketch of the floor plan, you know, this is the dining area, this is the bar area, and the entertainment is going to be here.

79
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,235
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we need to know or see.

80
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will, I'll be happy to resubmit that.

81
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,184
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can do that.

82
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:54,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that if my both my fellow commissioners agree, we can pass it with a contingent upon Daria receiving that.

83
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:59,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll get it for sometime as soon as I possibly can.

84
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:06,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, Alan and Ben, you have any input on on this particular entertainment license?

85
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, you've got more experience with this.

86
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's, I know,

87
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:20,416
[SPEAKER_06]: that one of the licenses needed to be inspected by the building department if there was entertainment.

88
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:32,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And since they already were when they originally got their entertainment and they were just inspected by fire and building, it's kind of a moot point.

89
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:37,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, Bobby, your logic is sound, absolutely sound.

90
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We know Adam, we know the establishment.

91
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with it too.

92
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:48,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just as long as we get those, what the, uh, building department and board of health, I think those were the last two signatures.

93
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:56,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't, I don't have a problem making a conditioned upon, uh, those two signatures and police needed.

94
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

95
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:02,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Police and fire were already signed off on it, which is the important thing.

96
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, um, yeah, no, it's a Ben.

97
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,370
[SPEAKER_06]: How about yourself?

98
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might have lost Ben.

99
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, you and I are in agreement.

100
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:20,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

101
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:36,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll conditionally make a motion to approve the entertainment license for Snappy Patties in West Medford, of course, subject to those two final signatures if necessary.

102
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,132
[SPEAKER_05]: in the sketches, what I was looking for.

103
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: In the sketches.

104
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:49,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Adam provided one before, but it wouldn't hurt to, since he's kind of broadening the establishment, it wouldn't hurt to get an updated version.

105
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just to make sure.

106
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:51,875
[SPEAKER_05]: OK with you, Adam?

107
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to get a sketch, and I have no worries.

108
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:55,736
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, cool.

109
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:56,757
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

110
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we can see it's not in front of a fire exit or something like that.

111
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:02,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

112
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:04,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay.

113
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so you made the motion now and I'll second it.

114
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:07,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

115
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:12,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, I was opposed here.

116
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, we got a new member hearing.

117
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,547
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have it.

118
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, motions passed Adam.

119
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,890
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as we received that, you're good to go, buddy.

120
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:23,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

121
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:23,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.

122
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:24,754
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

123
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:25,455
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

124
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,095
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the block.

125
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:28,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

126
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:29,658
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

127
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:30,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Done with that.

128
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh,

129
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we seen Mr. Arraso?

130
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:34,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

131
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:37,055
[SPEAKER_06]: See him?

132
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

133
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:40,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

134
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:52,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Lieutenant Lockowitz, Officer Smith, do you think we should move forward with this or do we want to wait a little longer for Mr. Arraso and we'll go on to...

135
00:08:55,383 --> 00:09:02,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Masuba, I've got a couple of things that I'm going to be discussing with Masuba, so I didn't know what your time frame was for you fellas.

136
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:10,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to discuss the incident that I wrote about for Razzos.

137
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

138
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:21,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, obviously Mr. Razzo has every right to weigh in, but I

139
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:28,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Given what I wrote in my conclusions, I don't believe it would be crucial whether or not he's here.

140
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:30,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

141
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we are received it as well.

142
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,568
[SPEAKER_06]: You sent it to Darrier.

143
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a chance to review it.

144
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure my fellow commissioners also reviewed it in detail.

145
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:46,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, the three of us know what's in the report.

146
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can, you know, whatever you're going to explain about it, we should understand it because we've already reviewed it as well.

147
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give a brief overview of it.

148
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:58,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

149
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:19,769
[SPEAKER_00]: The night before Thanksgiving on November 27th, Rosso's Bar and Grill operates a Thanksgiving Eve gathering that's usually a little bit larger than their normal bar crowd.

150
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,154
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, like years in the past, they hired a police detail, a uniformed officer.

151
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:42,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 9.40 p.m., a person from the city of Woburn entered the premise, walked around the establishment for about 20 minutes.

152
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:53,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Video evidence that I was able to obtain confirmed that he had never purchased or consumed any alcohol on the premise.

153
00:10:56,444 --> 00:11:05,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 20, 25 minutes after he entered the premise, he grabbed two women patrons of the establishment.

154
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,706
[SPEAKER_00]: The women reported it to the officer that was on duty.

155
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:16,608
[SPEAKER_00]: The person was removed from the establishment and subsequently arrested a little while later.

156
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:23,749
[SPEAKER_00]: My findings of the incident were that Razzos was properly staffed,

157
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:31,625
[SPEAKER_00]: that they did have that uniformed officer on duty as a paid detail.

158
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:49,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that this seemingly random person who came in by themselves never consumed any alcohol on the premise, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Arrazzo and his establishment

159
00:11:52,079 --> 00:12:06,546
[SPEAKER_00]: While an illegality did take place on the premise, I believe that they took the reasonable steps to prevent as well as interfere and end the situation that was presented before them.

160
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go on and on if you'd like me to.

161
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,649
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much all I have.

162
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:21,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of think that you put the nuts and bolts of it in there.

163
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:35,336
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'd like to get the opinion from the fellow commissioners, how they felt about, you know, after reading the report, if there were any chapter 138 violations in their opinion.

164
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:42,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, I can make a final comment at that point, you know, Alan.

165
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we lost Ben.

166
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

167
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Lieutenant Lockowitz.

168
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:51,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I did read your report, very thorough.

169
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you.

170
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:56,557
[SPEAKER_05]: You've covered all the details as far as I'm concerned.

171
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:01,538
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it looks like Rosso's did everything right.

172
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,940
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't anything in there that I thought might have been an infraction or they did something wrong.

173
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:25,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I applaud him for doing his job, for all you guys doing your job, and the fact that he did have a uniform detail on premises, which was smart because, you know, around the holidays, you have quite a few people coming in.

174
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:34,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just found it odd that out of the blue, someone from Woburn would just kind of walk around, almost like they were looking for somebody or looking for a girlfriend.

175
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm speculating.

176
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

177
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,542
[SPEAKER_05]: just really damn odd.

178
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:39,142
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

179
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about all I could come up with on that.

180
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, Mr. Chairman, I'm I'm fine with it.

181
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:54,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We just you know, in my my thinking is we put it in the file and and we just write good job and leave it be.

182
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:57,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ben, what were your thoughts?

183
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:00,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we lose Ben again, he might be having Wi-Fi issues.

184
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:06,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't see Ben, but I can I can throw my thoughts out there and yeah.

185
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:20,755
[SPEAKER_06]: The basically, yeah, I mean, since we were both in agreement that there were no violations as far as Chapter 138 goes, this is strictly a police matter.

186
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:30,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's what Lieutenant Lockowitz had mentioned is, you know, he could go on and on and on.

187
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:54,254
[SPEAKER_06]: What he didn't state that I got out of that report that I thought was, you know, it was very good was that this person was told by the uniformed officer and Mr. Razo to to take an Uber when he left and he didn't heed that warning.

188
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where the

189
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:11,745
[SPEAKER_06]: detail officer was able to radio ahead, and they were able to get this individual before he possibly killed somebody on the road driving himself.

190
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:19,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, Tabu, he, I believe, Lieutenant Lockwood, he had a firearm on him as well.

191
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, that was good police work.

192
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:34,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Mr. Razzo, he was being vigilant, providing additional staff, as well as hiring the uniformed police officer on historically one of the busiest nights of the year.

193
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:43,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and it shows this commission that he not only cares about his business, but the safety of his patrons and the public.

194
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he should just be looked at for that, which

195
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great if everybody could do that.

196
00:15:50,255 --> 00:16:07,989
[SPEAKER_06]: But Ben, I just commented, Alan just commented, if you have any input on the police report when you received it, it looks like you're having a little bit of issues with your Wi-Fi or whatever, but we both feel pretty comfortable with this.

197
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:15,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear us?

198
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can.

199
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm having some internet issues, as you might be able to see.

200
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:29,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hear about the comments about Rassos, and I didn't have any concerns with how they handled it well.

201
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:35,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody limited the possibility that that could have been worse.

202
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:47,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Alan suggested for Daria just to put it in their file, and we'll be good to go with that.

203
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:51,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And just thank God nothing happened and everything was good.

204
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:52,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

205
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:52,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

206
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

207
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:55,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

208
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:55,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

209
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all set with that?

210
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:01,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

211
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

212
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:04,172
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

213
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's move on.

214
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Lieutenant Lockowitz, thank you very much.

215
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Officer Smith, thank you very much.

216
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:13,325
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are welcome.

217
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:14,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome to stay.

218
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:18,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Officer Smith, do you have anything you'd like to comment on?

219
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:32,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to omit you here, but if you guys are leaving, both of you have a very merry Christmas and happy holidays, and hopefully we'll see you sometime after the new year.

220
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:33,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

221
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:34,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

222
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:35,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy holidays.

223
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,458
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.

224
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:37,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

225
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.

226
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Merry Christmas.

227
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:40,479
Bye.

228
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, moving on.

229
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Next item on the agenda is Mitsuba.

230
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:55,223
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, I see possibly two representatives from Mitsuba?

231
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:56,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

232
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and you are, name and address for the record, please.

233
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my name is Mei-Hui Hu.

234
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with the Hu Law Office, PC 251 Harvard Street, Street 3, Brookline Mass, 02446.

235
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:12,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

236
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:13,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Ms.

237
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Chen, correct?

238
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:14,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

239
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:33,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Miss Jen, and you are currently a 40% or we're currently a 40% owner of Masuba.

240
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:34,437
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

241
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:34,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, um,

242
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be able to tell us why you're here and exactly what's before us?

243
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:56,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there's a couple of things, multiple amendments to the changes.

244
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to get up my.

245
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: file on this?

246
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:05,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes I'd be happy to go over what we are seeking to amend.

247
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently they are for shareholders

248
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:20,304
[SPEAKER_02]: As the Commissioner pointed out, prior to these two amendments, Ms.

249
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:23,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Chain was the 40% shareholder.

250
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are two shareholders, each holding 20%, so together 40%.

251
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,253
[SPEAKER_02]: of the shareholder are selling their shares to Ms.

252
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Chen.

253
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:39,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So after this amendment, Ms.

254
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:45,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Chen will hold 80% together with a remaining shareholder with the 20%.

255
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:55,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are no shareholder added, just that the existing two shareholders are moving on to other ventures.

256
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,574
[SPEAKER_02]: with no change to the operation, no change to the manager.

257
00:20:03,656 --> 00:20:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

258
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:20,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I did notice that there were no changes to the manager and I believe it's Ms., hang on one second, Ms., did we say Lee?

259
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:22,433
[SPEAKER_06]: L-E-I is Lee?

260
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:29,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, she's still going to be the, uh, let's say hang on.

261
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Secretary director director and secretary.

262
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:34,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

263
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:34,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

264
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:34,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

265
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:37,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay.

266
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:38,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I.

267
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,581
[SPEAKER_06]: have a couple of questions on it.

268
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:47,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, Ben, do you guys, would you like me to state what I found or is there something you guys?

269
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through it too.

270
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:51,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some questions, but I don't want to repeat your question.

271
00:20:51,471 --> 00:21:00,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you lead it off and if there's something in there that you didn't cover, I can cover over or come back to it.

272
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:00,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

273
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,800
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

274
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds good.

275
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

276
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:06,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Put this over here.

277
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:10,835
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

278
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:24,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, one of the questions I had was on page one of the actual forms.

279
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:36,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what page it is on the email.

280
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

281
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's page one, but it is page five on the email, on the electronic file that we received.

282
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:59,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It's under block number one, business entity information.

283
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It says transfer 20% of the ownership.

284
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:09,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be, in my opinion, 40% of the ownership because we're getting 20% from two people.

285
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:15,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, that's a typo, it's supposed to be 40%.

286
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:23,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if you could correct that, that would be one of the items that I looked into.

287
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:38,461
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote of the entity, I was looking at, there might have been two boxes that should have been checked, but there's no need to check change of offices or directors, because they're going to stay the same.

288
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:47,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The other two folks were just assistant secretaries, I believe.

289
00:22:48,578 --> 00:23:00,749
[SPEAKER_06]: The third thing I found was there's no, hold on a second.

290
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:14,926
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no business structure documents from the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Articles of Organization.

291
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:25,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to have the new officers on there, and that's something that you get, I guess, from the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

292
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:29,220
[SPEAKER_06]: That is missing, and that will have to be sent to DARIA.

293
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:37,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will make sure that one copy is downloaded and submitted to the licensing board to complete.

294
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:44,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And also make that one correction on the percentage, supposed to be 40% that we are seeking amendment on.

295
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

296
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: But the, you know, the,

297
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:59,137
[SPEAKER_06]: that other document, the Articles of Organization, that's going to have to be to Daria within, I would say, seven days.

298
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:06,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We can pass this on a contingent basis if you're able to take care of these issues within seven days.

299
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:10,727
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, it's gonna have to go till next month because that's important.

300
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:14,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely take care of that within seven days.

301
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll never get by the ABCC, that's why.

302
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:30,504
[SPEAKER_06]: The last question I believe I had was, the numbers don't add up for me as far as the financing goes.

303
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:33,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see where I am with that.

304
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:39,290
[SPEAKER_06]: On page 8 of the PDF, which is page 4 of the application,

305
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: source of cash contribution.

306
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It says Ms.

307
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:45,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Chen, $90,000.

308
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:58,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And seller financing was 27,000 from, I believe it's Ms.

309
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Z, excite me.

310
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a show Kong Lee for 70,000.

311
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:08,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

312
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Shokun Lee a private personal loan?

313
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:14,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what that is?

314
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,960
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of my questions.

315
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,542
[SPEAKER_05]: In a relationship, that was gonna be one of my questions.

316
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:21,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

317
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:23,103
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ms.

318
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:24,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Chen's husband.

319
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, okay.

320
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:33,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Is a personal loan and Shokun, Xiaochen Lei, Xiaochen,

321
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:43,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Xiaochen Lei has no shareholder interest in Mazuba.

322
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I did review the promissory note and there was no language in there.

323
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:57,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering what that personal loan was secured upon because there's no pledge of stock or anything like that.

324
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:06,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if I can just jump in a bit, if I can see what's happening is the 70,000 person alone.

325
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:09,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see that it's due on it before 12, 31, 28.

326
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:16,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's another promissory note that's due for 27,000.

327
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's due the end of January of next year.

328
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:20,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I reading that right?

329
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:22,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It says 1-31-25.

330
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:22,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

331
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:26,339
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's due in 40-something days?

332
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

333
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

334
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:35,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of these lenders are seeking pledge.

335
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:46,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the words on this chain is good as gold.

336
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:46,437
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

337
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:53,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So the numbers still, to me, don't add up.

338
00:26:56,084 --> 00:27:10,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the 90,000, whether you're looking at 70,000, is coming from Shoukang Li.

339
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:24,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shoukang Li has to show either three months bank statements or a note from his bank stating

340
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,511
[SPEAKER_06]: that that money is in the account.

341
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:31,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think what you're driving is it looks like we're about $20,000 short.

342
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:31,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

343
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:32,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

344
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:36,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the 47, 27 of it is a promissory note.

345
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's 20 missing there.

346
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:40,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

347
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And where I was going after the loan from

348
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Shokun Lee is that Ms.

349
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:59,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Chen is going to, if that missing $20,000 is in her account, she has to show three months of that money being in her account.

350
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:05,974
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to account for the whole 90,000, which we're not doing because we don't have any documents here for that.

351
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:07,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

352
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,796
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely right.

353
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:12,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

354
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:18,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Chain is using 20,000 of her personal fund to purchase.

355
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the rest of the money is financing through the seller or financing through her husband.

356
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:27,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

357
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:28,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.

358
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:36,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So add that to the shopping list articles and three month bank statements showing the 20,000 is liquid and where it's coming from.

359
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:52,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And also either the three months bank statement from Shokong Lee or a note from his bank on their letterhead stating that that money is in his account.

360
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:53,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

361
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:54,473
[SPEAKER_02]: That he has 7,000.

362
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:55,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

363
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:56,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

364
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:00,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one question.

365
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:05,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 20%, that was supposed to be 40%, but the 90%, 90,000 is supposed to be 90,000, is that right?

366
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:06,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because the 10 is 43,000 and Z is 47,000.

367
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the 90 is coming from.

368
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

369
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:13,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I was just asking them just because it's not supposed to be 180,000, okay.

370
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's not presented accurately.

371
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the course of cash contribution, we should have written down shell chain, miss chain, put down 20,000 cash.

372
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:45,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can add the financing of 27 and a 70.

373
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:47,874
[SPEAKER_02]: The number would add up.

374
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

375
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:58,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, math, you can arrive at the answer in 100 different ways and still get to the right answer.

376
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:02,977
[SPEAKER_05]: But for clarity, yeah, I think, attorney, counsel, I think you're right, just for clarity.

377
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:04,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

378
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:07,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll make that correction, just make it easier to read.

379
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:09,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

380
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:13,246
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

381
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, I have no other questions or so.

382
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:24,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.

383
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:31,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor understands our concerns and she'll make the corrections and the updates.

384
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:39,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Same here.

385
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:42,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, we can conditionally approve this.

386
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:49,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will have to be corrected within seven days.

387
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:59,650
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's diarrhea doesn't have it within seven days, it will automatically be disapproved and it'll go with no action.

388
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:03,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'll have to wait until next month's meeting to do the whole thing over again.

389
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll do our best, but should be easy to supplement the answers, the documentation to answer your questions.

390
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:26,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you may want to take a little closer look at that page for where it's a source of cash contribution, because I just looking at that, I don't know if that's even filled out correctly.

391
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:27,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, you know, Ms.

392
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Chen for 90,000, total 90,000, but she might.

393
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:40,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have time to look into it too deep right now, but source of funding, she might have to be in there for 27,000, 20,000 to make that.

394
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

395
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think make it easier to read.

396
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:47,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

397
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:53,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, you've probably done enough purchase and sales agreements where everything's broken down.

398
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,340
[SPEAKER_05]: down payment, you know, good faith money.

399
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:10,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in that section there, if you just kind of break it down like 20, 20, you know, and explain it all, and then it all adds up to 90,000, just like a residential purchase and sales agreement, you're probably seeing plenty of those.

400
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:13,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I can definitely do that.

401
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:13,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

402
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, very good.

403
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:18,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben, you all set?

404
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:20,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I'm good too.

405
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

406
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:24,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if any of you gentlemen want to make a motion.

407
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just add one thing?

408
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

409
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Dari.

410
00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:30,762
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, it's okay.

411
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:31,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought of this.

412
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:44,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you add the paperwork in, just make sure you resend me the whole application because it's going to take me a little while to like cut out whatever is incorrect, put it in.

413
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you could just resend it to me, that would be great.

414
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll send it in one.

415
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:48,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

416
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine, just as long as everything is in there.

417
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:59,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just easier for me to submit to the commissioners, and then I can submit to ABCCA right after, whenever they approve it.

418
00:32:59,412 --> 00:32:59,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

419
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:00,933
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it makes sense, Daria.

420
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:03,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy to try to stitch the pages together.

421
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:04,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

422
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:06,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

423
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:10,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Shame on me, Daria, because I was supposed to have that in my notes as well.

424
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:11,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, you're fine.

425
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:16,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to let them know that that's the way we like to receive it back.

426
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's good.

427
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:18,437
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

428
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan events.

429
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:25,661
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a motion or you want me to do it.

430
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:29,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, you can make the motion.

431
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Get my internet back here.

432
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:31,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

433
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:52,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to approve conditionally upon receiving the articles of organization and three-month bank statements and a little more detailed as to how the $90,000 is being put together for, what was the address here?

434
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: 30, sorry.

435
00:33:57,206 --> 00:34:06,909
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, for 38 Riverside Ave, Matsuba, uh, is Sakaya, uh, doing business as Matsuba Sakaya Sushi Bar and Grill.

436
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and also the transfer of 40 percent ownership.

437
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And the transfer of- of the funds, right.

438
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:16,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, motion for a change of officers and the transfer of stock.

439
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:17,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

440
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:23,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And excuse me for, uh, butchering the la- the names.

441
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:23,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

442
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:27,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Ben, you want to second?

443
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second the motion made by Commissioner Maturana.

444
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,700
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

445
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

446
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:33,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

447
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:35,703
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

448
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

449
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:42,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passed as long as Derry receives those documents.

450
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

451
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:46,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

452
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:47,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

453
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:48,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

454
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:48,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

455
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:49,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

456
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:49,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Chen.

457
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:50,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You as well.

458
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:51,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

459
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:52,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye, Ms.

460
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Chen.

461
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:56,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

462
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:58,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was interesting.

463
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:07,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke with Ralph earlier today, and that's kind of where I came from with the seven day thing.

464
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:16,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Ralph was the one that suggested you can grant the contingent upon blah, blah, blah, but only give them seven days.

465
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says,

466
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:31,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I've never heard of the other thing, but where it was a personal loan, the person could either get three months statements from their bank or just a letter from the bank.

467
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:39,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't ever recall doing that before, but supposedly where they're not a financial institution, just a letter would be okay, I guess.

468
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:45,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's kind of what he commented on it.

469
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:50,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that was about it on that one.

470
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:55,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, almost like a source of funds, a source of funds, you know.

471
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:56,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

472
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:58,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's seventy thousand.

473
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:04,179
[SPEAKER_06]: He says they basically just want to make sure there's money there before the license is granted.

474
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:11,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I always kind of thought for some reason, I don't know why it was to possibly prevent money laundering of some sort.

475
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:11,246
[SPEAKER_06]: But

476
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

477
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:18,792
[SPEAKER_05]: There's either $70,000 or there isn't $70,000.

478
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:23,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there isn't, then this whole thing falls apart.

479
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:31,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the husband thing and everything kind of makes sense, where it's a four-year thing with no interest.

480
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I always wonder, why are we checking the financials, though?

481
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, probably because we got a bank VP on the commission.

482
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

483
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Retired.

484
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:51,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to know the source of funds, whether they have the money.

485
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes back to the chairman's thought.

486
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:59,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You wonder sometimes if money could be laundered.

487
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's in the bank, and we know that it's all straightforward, the transaction at inception.

488
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:08,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't hurt.

489
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:09,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't hurt.

490
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:10,706
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't hurt.

491
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:11,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

492
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, I mean, it's difficult enough trying to decipher it, you know, with a lot of these, you know, names that you don't recognize too, or that I don't recognize.

493
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:25,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of, you know, it was for the quarries.

494
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know if these folks were male or female.

495
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:28,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

496
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:36,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, when I read through the promissory note, it kept using the, it kept referring to the personal pronoun, her.

497
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:45,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So I immediately thought that the holders of the notes were female, but she said husband.

498
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you look at the promissory note, it says to surrender her at the office or on her before.

499
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:57,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's just the pronoun they decided to use.

500
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:10,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the attorney there too was, um, might have needed a little more polish with these applications because there was stuff there that she should have known better that should have been here.

501
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:14,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, especially the, um, the articles and all that stuff.

502
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:20,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's, that's, that's, you know, amateur stuff for her, supposedly.

503
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:23,189
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a checklist.

504
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:25,750
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a checklist right on ABCC.

505
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all you do is follow the checklist.

506
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,910
[SPEAKER_05]: They submitted it.

507
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:29,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

508
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,651
[SPEAKER_06]: They submitted it right here with all of that.

509
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:33,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

510
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything was on it, except that's how I found out the stuff wasn't on there.

511
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:42,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, they did a good job.

512
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:48,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you say, I don't think this other company, these current owners had it for a while.

513
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a year, two years tops.

514
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I vaguely remember us doing something there.

515
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:01,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And I says, geez, I never eaten in there before.

516
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And my wife was away on vacation for some, I don't know, it's her sister's place or whatever.

517
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:06,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I went in and grabbed something to eat.

518
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:07,696
[SPEAKER_06]: The food was good.

519
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't many customers in the restaurant.

520
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:11,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you and some goldfish.

521
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:13,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

522
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, you've been in there.

523
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the pickup boy from the house.

524
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,270
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's too bad, because we would order from there, yeah.

525
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the food's good.

526
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:28,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And Vita Insurance across the street's my insurance agent, Frank Vita.

527
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:30,872
[SPEAKER_06]: He's holding an IM, and he's eating.

528
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:31,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, Mr. Vita.

529
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,372
[SPEAKER_06]: The food's pretty good.

530
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so we're past that.

531
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:40,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We did okay.

532
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:40,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

533
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:42,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on a second.

534
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:04,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

535
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:07,338
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, sorry, my office lost internet.

536
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to run outside to try to get something.

537
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the problem.

538
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we saw that.

539
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:12,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were on a job.

540
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:15,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going into the workshop.

541
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I was everywhere trying to see if it worked.

542
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,987
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

543
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:20,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It worked.

544
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:21,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

545
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:21,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

546
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

547
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,331
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

548
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:29,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we go ahead and approve those other items?

549
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:32,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what's on that next.

550
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:32,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

551
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:40,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess we don't have to do it in order for other business.

552
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:45,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I was talking with Ralph, I kind of told him what was going on with Razzos today.

553
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him the way we normally do it is if there's an incident at a place, the police send us a copy of the report.

554
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We each individually read it.

555
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:03,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And we each individually emailed Daria back with our opinion.

556
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:10,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And if two out of the three feel as though it's a police matter, we just say to put it in the file.

557
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:13,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, that's OK.

558
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:16,935
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, but you should be doing it the way you're doing it now.

559
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:22,896
[SPEAKER_06]: He says with Razzos, he says you want to send them a letter.

560
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:26,671
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you read it?

561
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:33,994
[SPEAKER_06]: In the future, send them a letter to appear for possible over-serve and disturbance.

562
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:47,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though you know it wasn't a fact because of the police report, they have to be notified just in case something happens or something comes out of it, it covers the city.

563
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,144
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, and when they get there, you have the police there.

564
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:56,166
[SPEAKER_06]: You have it just like the hearing.

565
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the police read the report.

566
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:14,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at that point, you can either vote to see if there were any violations or no violations, or in my opinion, the best thing to say is we'll take this under advisement and notify you by mail.

567
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way there,

568
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,954
[SPEAKER_06]: it kind of gives us a chance to hash it out.

569
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:26,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hash it out amongst ourselves because we're taking it under advisement.

570
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:29,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be hashed out just like the last violation.

571
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:30,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in our own room.

572
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,183
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about it.

573
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:40,749
[SPEAKER_06]: We felt what was the resolution that we had to come up with.

574
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,592
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said if it's something that

575
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:51,957
[SPEAKER_06]: More than two of you, or all of you, agree on that there in fact was something like what was at Razzos.

576
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:58,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay to put it right out there, right then and there, that you felt as though, like we did today, there were no violations.

577
00:42:59,366 --> 00:42:59,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says,

578
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:07,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Praise them, he says, because they did something that could have saved lives, he said.

579
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:20,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and that's good for other licenses to hear, especially even if, you know, something like this goes, whatever it goes on the city recording or whatever, or anybody's watching the meeting.

580
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't hurt.

581
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:30,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And other licenses know that we're looking for stuff like this.

582
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:38,229
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's other licensees, like on this meeting, and they're saying, wow, OK, well, yeah, they hired a police detail because it was very busy.

583
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And jeez, they checked all the video cameras in the place to make sure this guy didn't get a drink, because now there could have been violations at that point.

584
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says it just covers everybody.

585
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:58,455
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the days I says, well, I told him what we normally do is just throw it in a file and not even bring it.

586
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,336
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, no, you've got to bring it up before a meeting.

587
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:02,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be a special meeting or a hearing.

588
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:09,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Just have them appear on the regular monthly meeting and do exactly what we did today, which makes sense.

589
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

590
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Richie didn't come.

591
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:14,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you know, which which was fine.

592
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:15,263
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't required to.

593
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:16,183
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a hearing.

594
00:44:16,663 --> 00:44:16,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

595
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:19,925
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, in the future,

596
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:25,602
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll send them a letter and they will be required to because it will be like a hearing.

597
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

598
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You called it an over-serving disturbance.

599
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:31,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he said.

600
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:31,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

601
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:36,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a possible over-serving disturbance because that's why the police was called.

602
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:40,216
[SPEAKER_06]: The police were called to the establishment because there was a disturbance.

603
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:44,199
[SPEAKER_06]: When the police got there, if the disturbance

604
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:50,784
[SPEAKER_06]: proved to be an over serve, then that's something we'd look at a little different.

605
00:44:52,205 --> 00:45:01,487
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, after reviewing the video, after reviewing, interviewing the owner, bartender, whatever, which makes sense.

606
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Which makes sense.

607
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:07,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, like Rory said, the guy walked around for 20 minutes.

608
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:08,309
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't drink.

609
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:11,430
[SPEAKER_06]: He, you know, he never ordered a drink in the place.

610
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of gets,

611
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Razzles off the hook, um, because there was no, it came in like that.

612
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:26,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we determining, are we determining the criteria for, for it?

613
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:35,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it, it seems like there's been incidences that, uh, other places will say the great Medford beer hall, um,

614
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:41,194
[SPEAKER_03]: But they weren't at any fault of the establishment, and we didn't have them in before.

615
00:45:42,095 --> 00:45:46,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that any time there's some kind of incident, we should have the establishment in?

616
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:49,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time we receive a police report.

617
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,319
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that's exactly.

618
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:53,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben, you must have been reading my mind.

619
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:54,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I was.

620
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that there's two things.

621
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:02,304
[SPEAKER_05]: What Lieutenant Lockowitz sent us

622
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:08,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a narrative of what transpired that night.

623
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:17,097
[SPEAKER_05]: But in his narrative, he says that he's withholding the police report because of the two individuals who were

624
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:20,604
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, attack.

625
00:46:20,784 --> 00:46:22,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's too strong of a word.

626
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:25,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, assault and battery.

627
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So what Officer Lockowitz sent us, that's not the police report?

628
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: The official police report is something different?

629
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:34,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

630
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:45,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, probably got another report just for the assault and he might have even a 3rd report for the arrest and carrying a firearm firearm while you're intoxicated.

631
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:56,244
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't you can't I've got a license to carry and I very rarely carry, but if I'm going out to dinner and I'm going to have a drink, I cannot have a weapon on me.

632
00:46:56,424 --> 00:46:57,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's.

633
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,264
[SPEAKER_06]: way it is.

634
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:01,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't drink and carry a firearm.

635
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:03,186
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way you're supposed to do that.

636
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's probably a separate charge.

637
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:10,390
[SPEAKER_06]: The driving while under another separate charge, because he was over the legal limit.

638
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And then assaulting the two women was another charge.

639
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of that's got to do with us.

640
00:47:16,152 --> 00:47:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I know that.

641
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:20,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But to Ben's question, because it was mine too, is

642
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:25,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we received from Lieutenant Lockowitz, that's not the police report.

643
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:30,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just an outline or a narrative telling us what transpired that night.

644
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:34,147
[SPEAKER_05]: But the official police report is somewhere else.

645
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:35,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that?

646
00:47:35,468 --> 00:47:35,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

647
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:37,528
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

648
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:43,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they've got to have a different police report to charge this guy.

649
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,310
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

650
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're acting upon the narrative

651
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: the narrative that Lieutenant Lockowitz submitted to us?

652
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, for facts that were on that premise.

653
00:47:58,362 --> 00:48:14,951
[SPEAKER_06]: The facts were that this gentleman went into a Section 12 license, which comes under our jurisdiction, and they determined, after watching the video and everything else, that he apparently came in already intoxicated.

654
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:23,839
[SPEAKER_06]: He ordered no drinks from the bar or any waitresses, never had a sip of alcohol while he was in there because they had him on surveillance the whole time.

655
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:37,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he was going over and he's grabbing the two women, one of them that happened to be a police officer, which Lieutenant Lockowitz put in his report because it was not our establishment, but a Section 12 establishment.

656
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:45,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as they told this gentleman in this Section 12 establishment, no driving, you got to take an Uber.

657
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:50,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he's seen getting in his car, leaving the Section 12 establishment.

658
00:48:51,037 --> 00:48:52,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where it ended.

659
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Police officer radioed ahead.

660
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: They grabbed him.

661
00:48:57,121 --> 00:49:01,685
[SPEAKER_06]: They arrested him for driving while under and also carrying a loaded firearm.

662
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:03,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where it ends with us.

663
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,473
[SPEAKER_06]: everything else is police.

664
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:19,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, if he went in and he had a couple of drinks, then it's like, okay, now, you know, this guy drunk, he's so drunk, he's leaving, then it's a whole different story.

665
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:26,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think it's fair to just bring them in for possible

666
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:32,208
[SPEAKER_06]: overserve and disturbance, because that could really be the only two things they could do in there.

667
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:40,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Overserve, but start a fight, pick a fight with somebody, you know, I don't know, destruction of property, I don't know.

668
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:47,382
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, all we're concerned about is the overserve, you know.

669
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:50,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, I'm just looking back.

670
00:49:50,785 --> 00:49:54,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, this letter Rory wrote is not a police report.

671
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:58,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different because it doesn't have the sort of incident number or whatever.

672
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:00,534
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

673
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:05,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And right in this narrative, he says that, you know, he'll submit a police report.

674
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It does refer to the incident number, but it's like a.

675
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:21,322
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, I guess if something is, it's probably gonna be rare that it's just an incident report rather than, or sorry, yeah, incident report rather than a police report, but.

676
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:25,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to call this narrative that we got from Lieutenant Lockwood, so.

677
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, so I, so, cause we don't talk when we get those reports from Daria, do individually sort of speak back to Daria.

678
00:50:35,147 --> 00:50:50,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you sort of saying the protocol Bob would be, if it is an incident that's, you know, we should err on the side of bringing in that establishment so that we can do things right, clear the air or whatever.

679
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:58,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask the team what happened and see if there's any infractions to 138, like the chairman was saying, and then we go from there.

680
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound right, Bobby?

681
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:01,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

682
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that involves the police at this point, according to Ralph, because I told him the way we used to do it.

683
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:13,086
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, well, he says, you can get away with it, he says, but it can come back and bite you later.

684
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:14,427
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, okay.

685
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:22,170
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, anything that comes from the police, you want to treat it as a hearing and you can call in the owner a letter.

686
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:24,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the next meeting.

687
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if Mr. Russell came into this last meeting, we just had, we would just have let Rory explain.

688
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:30,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

689
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: This is likely what we would have done and said, thank you.

690
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:35,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. So you handled it.

691
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:38,389
[SPEAKER_03]: To the best of your ability, we don't have any further questions.

692
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:38,749
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.

693
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:39,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

694
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

695
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of what I was planning on doing.

696
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:53,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to ask Mr. Razzo to speak or offer him any time to speak only because all three of us knew that it was a police matter.

697
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So why bother putting your foot in your mouth?

698
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,401
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

699
00:51:58,721 --> 00:51:59,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

700
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like it.

701
00:52:00,902 --> 00:52:01,523
[SPEAKER_06]: But if

702
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:16,868
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a little more to it and we wanted to turn it into a hearing, which basically it is a hearing if we send them a letter to appear that there's been an incident reported by the police, blah, blah, blah.

703
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:21,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have to treat it as a hearing just like we did with this last hearing.

704
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:27,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not as crazy, and if we feel as though there's going to be charges,

705
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's it's kind of like, OK, we'll take this under advisement.

706
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:38,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's kind of like I watched a bunch of the Boston videos and stuff.

707
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's kind of they never give anybody a verdict at that point.

708
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always we take it under advisement.

709
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:45,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

710
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:46,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And come back.

711
00:52:46,526 --> 00:52:46,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

712
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:51,571
[SPEAKER_06]: They have their own little meeting in private and then they send them a written notice of what it is.

713
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:56,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that date of the notice, they've got five days, I guess, to appeal it to the ABCC.

714
00:52:57,566 --> 00:53:02,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this is a precedent then from to Ben's point going forward.

715
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:13,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we, if we get something from great American bear hall or something else, then we fire off this over serving disturbance slaughter and and we have them come in and then we talk to them.

716
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:14,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

717
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

718
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless it's something more focused like property damage or, you know, over serving property damage.

719
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:23,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

720
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:27,355
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why the damage in the property, if they were over, you know what I mean?

721
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:27,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

722
00:53:28,565 --> 00:53:33,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of an assault, an over-serving assault or whatever.

723
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:36,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I think disturbance is the best.

724
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:37,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, that's what he said.

725
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You said over-serving disturbance.

726
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:42,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the disturbance part, you're right.

727
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:46,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I always think of that commercial, stay in your lane, bro.

728
00:53:46,174 --> 00:53:47,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's nothing with us.

729
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:52,317
[SPEAKER_05]: But the over-serve, that could come under our jurisdiction.

730
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, exactly.

731
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:57,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's just good practice in the future.

732
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's kind of flattering when I talked to Ralph today, he says, Bobby, he says, call me anytime, blah, blah, blah.

733
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:08,045
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I use Medford in my presentations all the time.

734
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:11,927
[SPEAKER_06]: There's four cities, Medford, Cambridge, and he nicknamed two more.

735
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know the other two.

736
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:18,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But he says, they're really proactive, they're doing a great job, they're doing this, they're doing that.

737
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:27,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's actually going to use the RAZO thing without RAZOs as an example of something that, you know, a way to handle it.

738
00:54:27,992 --> 00:54:32,233
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get any reports from the police, blah, blah, blah, this is the way Medford handles it.

739
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and let's see.

740
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:46,016
[SPEAKER_06]: He says that, he says, you know, basically all the questions you asked me, he says, were right on as far as the 40% thing goes and the money thing that we all found.

741
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:50,597
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, yeah, he says, that's, he says, all that's, you're right on with all that stuff.

742
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are doing a great job there and anytime, any questions.

743
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're really happy with us.

744
00:54:56,658 --> 00:55:02,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And the nice thing about that is like when this new owner of the, what does he call it?

745
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The establishment, the old porch.

746
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:16,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Ralph said for me to tell Daria on the 2nd or 3rd, whenever you're back to work, just make sure that gets submitted right away with a letter.

747
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:20,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote down what he wanted in the letter here somewhere.

748
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:30,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Either on the 2nd or the 3rd, forward the application, put letter with stating did not renew.

749
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:34,320
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, meaning that license did not renew.

750
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:40,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I guess you must resubmit the application at that time for the establishment.

751
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:47,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So just, um, make sure you state in it there that they, um, that they did not renew the license.

752
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So that opens up that address.

753
00:55:51,108 --> 00:56:01,739
[SPEAKER_06]: bar a new license, which we already approved, or it was either a, no, it was a new license, it wasn't a transfer, so it was a new license, and that opens up that address.

754
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the good thing about it is, you know, Ralph's

755
00:56:06,347 --> 00:56:18,811
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're proactive with the ABCC, the ABCC is gonna be proactive, not necessarily do us favors or anything or vote in our favor if we find things, that's not the case.

756
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:28,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But when somebody like this gentleman who's been trying in an unforeseen type of thing and something needs to just be pushed up the list a little higher,

757
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: cut through a little red tape and get it out as far as, because it's already been approved.

758
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:35,936
[SPEAKER_06]: He says the whole thing's already been approved.

759
00:56:36,016 --> 00:56:38,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that they needed the new license.

760
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:40,618
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't give it to that same address.

761
00:56:41,538 --> 00:56:43,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got the new license now.

762
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:44,159
[SPEAKER_06]: It went good?

763
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:45,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

764
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

765
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

766
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of works for us a little bit too.

767
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:50,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

768
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:52,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Dario, I'm sorry.

769
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:54,482
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your buddy's name?

770
00:56:55,502 --> 00:56:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a he or a she?

771
00:56:58,108 --> 00:56:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's a she.

772
00:56:58,669 --> 00:56:59,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Best friend in the whole world.

773
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Work from home calling.

774
00:57:03,572 --> 00:57:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she a mouser?

775
00:57:10,671 --> 00:57:11,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Does she get mice?

776
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:14,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all mouses.

777
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:15,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats are great mouses.

778
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:23,618
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got rats the size of squirrels from Tufts, right, when they put up these new buildings.

779
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:30,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a cat about that side, came running down my driveway with a rat in his mouth.

780
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:32,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how he was carrying it.

781
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the size of a squirrel.

782
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:39,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying, I hope he's not taking it home to show his masters his build with it.

783
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:45,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's terrible.

784
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, okay, shall we move on?

785
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

786
00:57:51,492 --> 00:57:56,096
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have brought refreshments and cookies and we could have our own little Christmas party at the same time.

787
00:57:56,116 --> 00:57:56,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

788
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:02,340
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I doing with my papers?

789
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd my agenda go?

790
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I dropped it on the floor?

791
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:18,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

792
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:22,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it under the computer so I wouldn't lose it.

793
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,801
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to approve a list of the 2025 liquor license renewals.

794
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:35,165
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you want to do it?

795
00:58:35,185 --> 00:58:39,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to do it because it's clubbed and there's alcohol and there's beer and wine?

796
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:42,495
[SPEAKER_05]: just pick one.

797
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:46,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you guys are a little more experienced at it than me.

798
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:55,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I did notice one thing though, Darrier, with the beer and wine or

799
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:03,847
[SPEAKER_06]: The place on Mystic Avenue, the hell's the name of them, that we just granted an all-alcohol to?

800
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Avelinos.

801
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:05,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Avelinos.

802
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't signed because it was a beer and wine.

803
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:14,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of my questions was, did Peter not sign that because it was beer and wine only?

804
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:20,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I looked for all-alcohol, and there wasn't even one in there for him for all-alcohol.

805
00:59:20,596 --> 00:59:22,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how

806
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless I missed it on the all alcohol.

807
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:28,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we just approved it.

808
00:59:28,704 --> 00:59:29,585
[SPEAKER_07]: You just approved it.

809
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:33,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think about it, the sheets went out in September.

810
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:36,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's whatever your status was at that point.

811
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So if he was, but I'm surprised.

812
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:39,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

813
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:40,453
[SPEAKER_07]: How did I miss that?

814
00:59:40,513 --> 00:59:41,453
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't sign that.

815
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:43,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost positive he didn't.

816
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:48,539
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look under the beer and wine, wine and malt rather, with cordials.

817
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was the last one on it, if I'm not mistaken.

818
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,160
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not with Cordials, though.

819
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,900
[SPEAKER_07]: He's regular.

820
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:58,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wine and malt, I believe.

821
00:59:59,561 --> 00:59:59,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

822
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, down the bottom.

823
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got an X on the signature, but he printed Peter DeSista.

824
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:09,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is an X considered a signature?

825
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

826
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:15,425
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the last one on that file.

827
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was skipping around.

828
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's on page 8.

829
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Sisto Enterprises Inc.

830
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:29,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's page 8 on wine and malt.

831
01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:39,242
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like he forgot to sign my... I don't think he forgot.

832
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're right.

833
01:00:40,323 --> 01:00:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I think because he did the...

834
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:49,630
[SPEAKER_07]: changeover, he probably just thought, I don't know, I didn't catch it.

835
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you I know what it is.

836
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:56,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you that's his wife that filled it out and put an extension.

837
01:00:56,973 --> 01:01:00,174
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't write that neat.

838
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:01,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he wouldn't write that.

839
01:01:03,276 --> 01:01:05,017
[SPEAKER_06]: That's women's handwriting right there.

840
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:07,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, you're right.

841
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:09,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Just speculation.

842
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

843
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask them to sign it.

844
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:17,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing with 85, 95.

845
01:01:17,184 --> 01:01:20,946
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave me two 95s and he's like, I'm pretty sure I brought it to you in November.

846
01:01:20,966 --> 01:01:22,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, no, no.

847
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:24,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two, 95 and 95, not 95 and 85.

848
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:28,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, just date in November because he technically did give it to me.

849
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:32,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You just gave me the wrong one, the wrong one twice.

850
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:37,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was technically sent in and paid and everything?

851
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:37,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

852
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:39,358
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they did everything they needed to do.

853
01:01:39,398 --> 01:01:41,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just having them sign it.

854
01:01:41,479 --> 01:01:46,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when you issue a license, you're going to be issuing them a full liquor?

855
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:47,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how it goes?

856
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:52,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they just got approved.

857
01:01:53,468 --> 01:01:57,349
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple of days ago for the all-alcohol license.

858
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:59,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So, technically, they would be for whatever they got approved.

859
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:04,931
[SPEAKER_07]: As of January 1st, they can, well, as of now, they are allowed to serve all alcohol.

860
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:12,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So, now, well, now, that had to be approved by ABCC.

861
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:15,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you're just saying that got approved the last couple of days?

862
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:17,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, by the state, yes.

863
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:18,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

864
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:22,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So, who actually prints the actual license, you or them?

865
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:26,648
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the actual physical license, me.

866
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

867
01:02:28,129 --> 01:02:28,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

868
01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:32,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you alter the hours on that if need be?

869
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

870
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:34,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The ability to, okay.

871
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:34,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

872
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:40,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's another thing I was going to run by you guys is, um, I already spoke to Daria about it.

873
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:51,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, next year within the paperwork, we have to see if we can, um, well, we, we're going to request that we want a copy of the common vigilance license.

874
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:59,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason being is, as I was telling Darrier, I went into the clerk's office and I talked to one of the clerks about six months ago or so.

875
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:08,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was something to do with hours and inspections when we're trying to get the building department with the fire department all together to get these done for renewals.

876
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:16,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And she pulled out a folder with a stack about an inch thick saying, these are all the ones that they never sent in, that are incomplete.

877
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of sat back and looked at her, and I says, really?

878
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:20,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says, yeah.

879
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:24,818
[SPEAKER_06]: She says, those are the ones they still haven't completed.

880
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:33,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like saying to myself, well, OK, in the city of Medford, in order to serve alcohol, you have to have a common vigilance license.

881
01:03:34,503 --> 01:03:42,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should require a valid copy of a common vigilance license, even if it's

882
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: for the existing year when they turn their paperwork in because they're not, their common vigilance license renewal is due by December 31st.

883
01:03:54,347 --> 01:04:03,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we get just a copy of the prior one, it's still valid in November when Daria's doing our renewals, that's all we want.

884
01:04:04,117 --> 01:04:12,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that common vigilance license, Daria will have it in hand and she could say, oh, yeah, this one here, they got the extension.

885
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,084
[SPEAKER_06]: They were open until 1 a.m.

886
01:04:14,524 --> 01:04:18,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday through Friday or whatever, and put it on their license at that time.

887
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:22,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we know that they're good.

888
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:23,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They're serving food.

889
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:28,930
[SPEAKER_06]: They're serving food till 1 a.m., if that's what their license says, and everybody's good.

890
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But we got no way of knowing that.

891
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And I brought it up to the city clerk, because, you know, we got discussing something else.

892
01:04:36,654 --> 01:04:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, he says, yeah, he says, listen, he says, I'm two people short here.

893
01:04:41,637 --> 01:04:43,538
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I'm trying to do the best I can.

894
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:44,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I says, I understand, sir.

895
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,780
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, it's nothing we're gonna do this year.

896
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,341
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, we're gonna get to it.

897
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:50,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, but, you know, we,

898
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:56,046
[SPEAKER_06]: we have to know that they've got a valid common vigilance license, or we can't grant them an alcohol license.

899
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:57,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that simple.

900
01:04:58,248 --> 01:05:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, maybe in another month or two when things calm down, we'll send a little letter out stating spring reminder, blah, blah, blah, make sure this is up to date, this is up to date, common vigilance license.

901
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:19,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Note, we will be requiring a copy of a current common vigilance license for next year's renewals.

902
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:24,386
[SPEAKER_06]: It sent out a couple or three notices like that up until the renewals next year.

903
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:28,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one if we have another seminar, we'll send it out with that.

904
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,613
[SPEAKER_06]: One with something else prior to the summer break.

905
01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Reminder, we're going to be not meeting in July and August.

906
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:43,619
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, make sure you have a current common vigilance license to submit.

907
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:49,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that'll do it.

908
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:50,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

909
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, I'm looking at the license that was surrendered by Chili Garden, and the bottom left has their hours.

910
01:05:58,772 --> 01:06:02,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the hours during which alcoholic beverage may be sold.

911
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:03,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It says 11 a.m.

912
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:04,117
[SPEAKER_05]: to 11 p.m.

913
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:07,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is in the bottom left of the actual license.

914
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but how do we know that's still their hours?

915
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:14,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, put that for hours, you know what I mean?

916
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:16,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what's his name?

917
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:20,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Snappy Patty's just had theirs moved up to 1 a.m.

918
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:23,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I say the certain days.

919
01:06:23,663 --> 01:06:24,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

920
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't make sense to ask for a current vet.

921
01:06:28,146 --> 01:06:28,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense.

922
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:29,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

923
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:35,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if the hours stay the same, we have to know that they're serving food.

924
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:36,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

925
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:37,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Hours.

926
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're not serving food, if they don't have a current vet,

927
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:48,879
[SPEAKER_06]: say the kitchen closed, the Board of Health closed them down or whatever, they shouldn't be serving alcohol.

928
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:58,301
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only two in the city that can serve alcohol with no food, Medford Brewing and Chevalier.

929
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:02,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Chevalier's got a general section 12 license.

930
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not required to serve food.

931
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:07,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, those are the only two.

932
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:13,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the other one, that's a farmer's brewer.

933
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:14,726
[SPEAKER_05]: That's totally different.

934
01:07:15,206 --> 01:07:18,066
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a brewing license, yeah.

935
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:21,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this make the renewal process much more clunky?

936
01:07:21,607 --> 01:07:23,467
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to send in a convict with the renewal?

937
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because they have to supply the proof of insurance.

938
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:37,590
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to send in a form from the fire department, the building department, which they haven't been doing for years, until the last couple.

939
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:42,765
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have to send in their renewal paperwork.

940
01:07:43,386 --> 01:07:44,267
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is there?

941
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:52,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just one more item that they have to submit along with their check to DARIA.

942
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got to be in November 30th.

943
01:07:55,641 --> 01:07:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how can we do that?

944
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:01,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I read that by Ralph today.

945
01:08:02,403 --> 01:08:03,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says, you're right.

946
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:13,887
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, if the city requires that they have to have food, then they have to have a common vigilance license, a valid common vigilance license, so they can't serve food.

947
01:08:13,907 --> 01:08:14,967
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

948
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:19,229
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it's not a big deal if they do the right thing.

949
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:22,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not caring if they're

950
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:30,115
[SPEAKER_06]: next year's common vitilis license or whatever we care about from November 1st to November 30th.

951
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:33,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a common vitilis license to cover that period?

952
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:34,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

953
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:35,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

954
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So next year it'll be the same thing.

955
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:43,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you got it to cover that period even though you're getting a new one in a month you still got valid one.

956
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:44,627
[SPEAKER_06]: The current one.

957
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:45,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

958
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:45,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

959
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:51,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got a question, you've got hesitation about it, Ben.

960
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:56,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's something that needs more discussion?

961
01:08:56,818 --> 01:08:57,018
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

962
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:58,100
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

963
01:08:58,861 --> 01:08:59,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

964
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:02,145
[SPEAKER_06]: You're thinking about Santa Claus, what Santa Claus is getting the kids?

965
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just in my, I'm in my work day.

966
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, trying to keep it moving.

967
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:10,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I gotcha.

968
01:09:10,653 --> 01:09:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.

969
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:12,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.

970
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:23,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so did you want to, how do we do this, announce that we're going to take a look at, I think what is it, three items from Daria?

971
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,970
[SPEAKER_06]: and approve all at once type of thing?

972
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

973
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,472
[SPEAKER_05]: We certainly can.

974
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can make a motion.

975
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,775
[SPEAKER_05]: There's four categories, right?

976
01:09:33,815 --> 01:09:39,379
[SPEAKER_05]: There's club, there's farmer's brewery, there's all alcohol, and then there's wine and malt.

977
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

978
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That sound right?

979
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:43,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

980
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:46,544
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

981
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there would be a caveat because we now know that

982
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:59,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. DeSisto is all alcohol, not just beer and wine, so we know that correction has to occur.

983
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:19,639
[SPEAKER_05]: But I motion to accept the renewals for the club renewals, the farmer's brewer renewals, all alcohol renewals, and then wine and malt with cordials renewals to be accepted for the upcoming year.

984
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:21,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Package stores as well.

985
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, in package stores.

986
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:25,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

987
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:26,274
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I miss that?

988
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:27,594
[SPEAKER_05]: In package stores also.

989
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:30,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say Farmer's Brewery too?

990
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:30,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

991
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:34,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer's Brewery is one.

992
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:43,036
[SPEAKER_03]: With the exception that signature is on, what's his name?

993
01:10:43,457 --> 01:10:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Avalinos?

994
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:45,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Avalinos, right.

995
01:10:46,437 --> 01:10:46,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

996
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember that signature was for malt and wine only and now he's all alcohol.

997
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:53,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he says.

998
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:53,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

999
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:54,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1000
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1001
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:55,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1002
01:10:56,406 --> 01:10:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1003
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria will take care of that technical stuff.

1004
01:10:59,707 --> 01:11:06,829
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understood that Daria said is that the ABCC will send it back the correct way, I guess, when it's approved.

1005
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:08,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's what I understood.

1006
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:31,700
[SPEAKER_07]: okay then we just got to get them to sign it then if they're going to kick it they'll send it back the right way exactly so i think so they have you signed for what it is at that point of your signature uh so it just got changed so they're not going to send us a brand they're not going to update it to all alcohol when it wasn't all alcohol at that point yeah

1007
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:39,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, next year they will send it to us and obviously they've been approved, but you get approval based on what you were at that point.

1008
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:42,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said September is when they was the cut off on that.

1009
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:54,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would say, yeah, like, any transfers or, like, any changes majorly, they would have not accepted it past certain point because it's still a process.

1010
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:55,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1011
01:11:56,702 --> 01:12:00,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we will be fine because they approved it.

1012
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll just send in the signature like that.

1013
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:07,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And because of the time, that's what it was.

1014
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:08,227
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1015
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, that's not a problem.

1016
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:20,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing, just to add to that, is the seasonal population increase form ties with that.

1017
01:12:20,492 --> 01:12:22,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also in this packet.

1018
01:12:23,675 --> 01:12:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try it.

1019
01:12:24,676 --> 01:12:28,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have to do that separate or can we patch it all together?

1020
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it can all go together.

1021
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:30,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1022
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:35,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all the renewal paperwork, so I'm going to set it all together.

1023
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the packet that I have to send out with the renewals.

1024
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:46,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You also want to approve, there was one more paper in there, the porch, the ones that did not renew.

1025
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1026
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:49,049
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1027
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:52,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I forgot about that one.

1028
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:53,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so MOLA.

1029
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's the next door to the porch.

1030
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:04,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the porch, right?

1031
01:13:04,148 --> 01:13:05,129
[SPEAKER_06]: MOLA something or other?

1032
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1033
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:12,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to accept that they did not renew.

1034
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,350
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only one thing on that document.

1035
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:15,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, yep.

1036
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Till the garden they surrounded.

1037
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,801
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't renew, but they surrender.

1038
01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:22,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's different.

1039
01:13:24,023 --> 01:13:25,444
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't renew.

1040
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:29,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how the porch next door to it has that bakery, has that grocery store?

1041
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not MOLA, right?

1042
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe so, no.

1043
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's completely separate.

1044
01:13:35,592 --> 01:13:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1045
01:13:37,154 --> 01:13:37,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

1046
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:41,157
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1047
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ben, you want to second my motion?

1048
01:13:46,401 --> 01:13:48,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'll second the motion made by

1049
01:13:49,895 --> 01:14:10,140
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Commissioner Maturana, um, for, uh, I'm just trying to say it right for the renewals of the club, uh, wine and malt farmers brewery, uh, package store and all alcohol as well as the seasonal population.

1050
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, and there was one other one that one.

1051
01:14:18,665 --> 01:14:23,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, in the surrender of the portions.

1052
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:26,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1053
01:14:27,412 --> 01:14:28,834
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was the non-renewal.

1054
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it wasn't a surrender.

1055
01:14:30,815 --> 01:14:32,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1056
01:14:32,096 --> 01:14:32,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it wrong.

1057
01:14:32,857 --> 01:14:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-renewal of the.

1058
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:34,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1059
01:14:37,627 --> 01:14:39,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Package says rather than certification.

1060
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:42,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was under renewal certification.

1061
01:14:43,431 --> 01:14:45,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just open it up, see what it exactly says.

1062
01:14:45,892 --> 01:14:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, renewal certification 2025 licenses who fail to renew for 2025.

1063
01:14:51,877 --> 01:14:57,781
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives the license number and Mola Bakery and Cafe DBA the porch.

1064
01:15:00,022 --> 01:15:01,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1065
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:03,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So you seconded Ben, right?

1066
01:15:03,845 --> 01:15:04,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1067
01:15:04,726 --> 01:15:05,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1068
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:06,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1069
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:08,203
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1070
01:15:09,064 --> 01:15:10,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

1071
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:11,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passed.

1072
01:15:14,687 --> 01:15:20,930
[SPEAKER_05]: The population is 58,744.

1073
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like it went down, right?

1074
01:15:24,272 --> 01:15:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wasn't it ringing the bell at 60,000 and we were like, all right, we got another license.

1075
01:15:29,015 --> 01:15:31,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to 65.

1076
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:36,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what's interesting?

1077
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:45,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was talking to our new elections manager, Danielle, and she was explaining to me, because I was like, the numbers don't add up.

1078
01:15:45,468 --> 01:15:49,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I originally asked her for a number, she was like, it's 50,000.

1079
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:51,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, that doesn't make sense.

1080
01:15:52,604 --> 01:15:57,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So she said that on a city level, we do the census, right?

1081
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:02,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Which will be a lot less, because unless you register, you won't be counted.

1082
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:09,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So she was like, the number that you want to go by is the federal census, which is the number where I got from the past couple of years.

1083
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: She kind of broke it down for me.

1084
01:16:12,195 --> 01:16:13,715
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, that's more accurate.

1085
01:16:14,856 --> 01:16:16,297
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do it every five years.

1086
01:16:18,638 --> 01:16:20,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of can go up and down.

1087
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:21,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like a little bit.

1088
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:26,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know why the state asks us to estimate because we can't really estimate.

1089
01:16:26,984 --> 01:16:30,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put in a number that it shows what it was as of July.

1090
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:38,292
[SPEAKER_07]: 2023, because it might shift a little bit, but it's probably not going to be up to date for the next couple of years.

1091
01:16:38,312 --> 01:16:39,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1092
01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:45,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So, then they were every 5 years that's technically like 2028 when the next 1 is going to.

1093
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:50,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, the more accurate 1. yeah, that's when we'll get, like, the more accurate number.

1094
01:16:50,214 --> 01:17:00,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I mean, I, I don't know how strict they are, but I kind of know somewhat remembering.

1095
01:17:01,775 --> 01:17:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: that, hey, we're over 60, are we eligible for a new license?

1096
01:17:05,776 --> 01:17:20,498
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was talking about California, yeah, he said something about it's every 5,000 Iraq goes up, but I don't know, 60 or 65, but- And it had to be consistent for 10 years, I think he was saying, right?

1097
01:17:20,518 --> 01:17:24,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't he saying that it has to be consistent for 10 years?

1098
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:27,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't remember.

1099
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:30,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Something I know was a couple of years that it had to be consistent, so.

1100
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:45,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's very confusing, but like you say, how can you get an accurate number if it's, unless you take the inaccurate city number, which is going to be lower and we're probably going to be a lot lower.

1101
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:45,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1102
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:53,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everybody, a lot of students here and there's a lot of, I feel like just people moving in and out.

1103
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:55,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, it's, I feel like it's very hard to.

1104
01:17:56,249 --> 01:17:56,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1105
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:56,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1106
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:57,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1107
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,910
[SPEAKER_06]: We just stick with the federal ones.

1108
01:17:59,010 --> 01:17:59,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, yeah.

1109
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:01,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what Danielle said.

1110
01:18:01,904 --> 01:18:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you should really look at the federal number versus the city, because city is just not accurate.

1111
01:18:09,046 --> 01:18:10,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't count everybody.

1112
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:14,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It only counts the people that register, and that's not everybody.

1113
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:21,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I was presented with a question real quick coming out of church last week or a couple of weeks ago.

1114
01:18:21,371 --> 01:18:24,392
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the people that go there, and he says, hey, Bobby, let me ask you something.

1115
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:32,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford doesn't have any beer and wine like in, you know, 7-Elevens and stores like that.

1116
01:18:32,268 --> 01:18:35,371
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, is it not allowed?

1117
01:18:35,431 --> 01:18:37,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I says, no, we have available licenses.

1118
01:18:37,673 --> 01:18:40,055
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got, I think, a dozen licenses or whatever.

1119
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:42,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says, well, how come they don't have any?

1120
01:18:42,938 --> 01:18:44,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I says, we really don't need them.

1121
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I says, look at all the liquor stores we got in the city of Medford.

1122
01:18:49,133 --> 01:18:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless it's a hardship that there's none in the area, why would you want to take business away from an existing package store?

1123
01:18:58,161 --> 01:19:03,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And each package store is within a short distance from any residents in the city.

1124
01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:07,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I says the only area I know that doesn't have it is up the heights.

1125
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,292
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like there's a liquor store like.

1126
01:19:11,932 --> 01:19:19,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Every, like, every court, like, South Medford, West Medford, I feel like kind of everywhere.

1127
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:27,837
[SPEAKER_06]: The Heights, I can't think of, but like, he was mentioning, you know, like, around the Riverside area and I says, well, Riverside, you get.

1128
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:32,560
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, uh, you got, you got cappies right down the street.

1129
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:35,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, you got Wegmans right there.

1130
01:19:35,643 --> 01:19:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the more you want there.

1131
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1132
01:19:38,825 --> 01:19:47,412
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way CBS is going to compete with Wegmans and total line over an Everett and cappies and Atlas.

1133
01:19:47,452 --> 01:19:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

1134
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:48,573
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.

1135
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:54,018
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of guaranteed was that little Christie's or whatever it is, you know, and it's kind of,

1136
01:19:55,170 --> 01:20:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: He wouldn't make any money down in Florida and the CBS is a section with is all wine and some of those bottles have been there for years.

1137
01:20:03,638 --> 01:20:08,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even think down there.

1138
01:20:08,743 --> 01:20:10,345
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy liquor anywhere in Florida.

1139
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:10,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1140
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:11,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1141
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:12,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's crazy.

1142
01:20:12,788 --> 01:20:15,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, you can get alcohol seven days a week.

1143
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,131
[SPEAKER_06]: All package stores are open.

1144
01:20:17,531 --> 01:20:17,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1145
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:23,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, you know, it's kind of like a moot point.

1146
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:29,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I mean, unless it's a real hardship, why grant it, you know?

1147
01:20:29,879 --> 01:20:30,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1148
01:20:31,481 --> 01:20:35,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I mean, you don't want the licenses that are there, so.

1149
01:20:36,604 --> 01:20:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, did that take care of all our business?

1150
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:40,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.

1151
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, somebody wanna make a motion to adjourn?

1152
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1153
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:46,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben, you wanna?

1154
01:20:47,902 --> 01:20:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: As to the year?

1155
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right.

1156
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:59,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So make a motion to adjourn our meeting December 18th, 2024 at 2.23 p.m.

1157
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:01,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everybody.

1158
01:21:02,214 --> 01:21:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I second the motion.
