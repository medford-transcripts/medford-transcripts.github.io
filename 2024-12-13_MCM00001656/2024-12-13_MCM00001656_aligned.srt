1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:06,475
April 9, 2020, 2024, and the time is 5.14 p.m.

2
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:09,738
The meeting will now come to order.

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,379
Roll call of the commissioners.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,862
I will have to apologize, Alba is not present tonight, she had a death in the family.

5
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:17,963
Commissioner Hunt?

6
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:19,804
Here.

7
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:21,526
Commissioner McGiven?

8
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:22,546
Here.

9
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:25,428
Here.

10
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:27,630
Commissioner Brzezinski?

11
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:29,513
I'm here.

12
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:31,434
And Commissioner Falasca?

13
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:35,977
Here.

14
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:37,237
Thank you.

15
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:39,278
And I myself am obviously present.

16
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:40,259
We have a quorum.

17
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:49,143
Also present this evening is going to be Sergeant Larry Rogers from the Medford Police Traffic Team, along with Sergeant Jordan Canava, Director of Traffic and Engineering.

18
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:53,205
Todd Blake is present at the meeting, as well as Special Projects Coordinator Jim Silva.

19
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:58,870
To the commissioners, the minutes of the February traffic commission meeting have been distributed.

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,511
Did you all have a chance to review them?

21
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:07,758
And if so, I'll entertain a motion to accept or modify or retract anything that needs to be.

22
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,200
A motion to approve.

23
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:12,442
I'll second that.

24
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:12,983
Can you guys hear me?

25
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:14,685
Yeah, we can now, yep.

26
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,967
It was very light in the beginning, now we got it.

27
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:27,655
On the motion of Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner McGiven, to approve the minutes of the February Traffic Commission meeting, roll call vote.

28
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,918
Why don't you call the roll call, so I can vote.

29
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:32,119
Commissioner Hunt?

30
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,059
Yes.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,081
Commissioner Brzezinski?

32
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,644
I was abstinent at the meeting.

33
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,477
Steve, it's pretty tough to hear you.

34
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:43,238
You're breaking up.

35
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:51,443
Commissioner Brzezinski, you're breaking up a little.

36
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,526
Just so it was, he's absent.

37
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:57,307
He's still talking.

38
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,850
I did read them, but I have no idea.

39
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,231
OK.

40
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,792
Can you hear me now?

41
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:05,633
Can you hear me now?

42
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:06,974
Yes, we can hear you now.

43
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,495
Can you hear me now?

44
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:10,316
Yes, can you hear us?

45
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:12,659
Can you hear us?

46
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:21,445
All right, Commissioner Brzezinski, we're gonna have you abstain because we did pick up that you were not present.

47
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:23,706
Commissioner McGibbon?

48
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:25,147
Yes.

49
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:29,069
And Commissioner Velasco?

50
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:40,696
Wow, I'm having a tough time hearing tonight.

51
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,377
This is interesting.

52
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:45,537
I think she may have been absent, too.

53
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,858
Okay, sure.

54
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:49,898
And Chief Buckley?

55
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:56,061
I reviewed all in order on a vote of 3 to 0 to 2 abstaining.

56
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,041
The motion passes.

57
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,042
The minutes have been approved.

58
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,903
We did not have a March meeting.

59
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:00,643
It was canceled.

60
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:05,425
And so we are here tonight on new business.

61
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,454
and it's quite an agenda tonight.

62
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,575
I know there was some conversation from some of the commissioners.

63
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:20,617
Commissioners want to take a particular item out of order?

64
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:28,141
Chief, can I take the GLX parking zone 2024-21?

65
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:36,185
Can we take that item first since perhaps a lot of people are here for that and there may be some overlap with some of the other items on here with that?

66
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:42,429
On the motion of Commissioner Hunt to take 2024-21 out of order, do I have a second?

67
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:44,349
Second.

68
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:47,090
Seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

69
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,411
I don't think we need to take a roll call vote.

70
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,491
All those in favor, aye?

71
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,312
Aye.

72
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,512
All those opposed?

73
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:56,373
The ayes have it.

74
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:03,613
24-21, GLX parking zone, pilot, South Medford, proposed conditions.

75
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:09,317
For this, we'll go to Director Todd Blake and Jim Silva.

76
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:10,838
Which one do you want to start?

77
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,060
And I believe you can unmute yourselves.

78
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,846
Todd seemed to have dropped out of the meeting.

79
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:25,510
I don't know if they're having some technical issues at City Hall, but I'll start the process.

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,731
I'm sure there's a clip.

81
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,272
It's throwing off everything.

82
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:37,432
I just wanted to mention that just a little overview of the GL zone.

83
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,293
If possible, there's Todd coming up now.

84
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:43,333
This is a trial.

85
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:44,934
This is a one-year trial.

86
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:50,395
If this is approved, it will be implemented on July 1st, 2024.

87
00:04:50,575 --> 00:05:02,238
These are for location that already has resident parking and is within roughly a quarter mile of the three Green Line transit stations.

88
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,341
The 2024 resident permit will not change.

89
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:12,808
The visitor pass program will only be valid for the street that the pass was issued on.

90
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:20,435
The current hour of enforcement is 24-7, unless otherwise posted on the resident parking sign.

91
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:25,279
Those streets outside of the zone will continue to be street by street.

92
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:36,635
Enforcing the zone approach allows a much more efficient use of resources and will not require so many annual variances and approvals.

93
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:41,477
It will be location versus where the individual lives.

94
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:50,701
The data and feedback will be reviewed over the year and will help us to improve our response and resourcing to resident parking.

95
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,143
And if it is approved tonight,

96
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,875
The C-Click Fix will add the GL Zone for residents to report related issues.

97
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:06,544
The street data will be loaded and beta testing will begin with handheld enforcement devices.

98
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:12,832
Information review on private ways will be revisited throughout the community.

99
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:20,204
The G will be added to the zone on the resident parking signs, so you'll know what zone you're in.

100
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:26,447
And the website and informational materials will be distributed to residents in the zone.

101
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,149
Todd, I'm gonna have you speak.

102
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,014
Director Blake.

103
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,295
Must be having difficulties.

104
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:46,252
He's a co-host.

105
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,473
He should be able to be upset.

106
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:48,173
Yeah.

107
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:48,713
Sorry.

108
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,393
I was just opening up the PowerPoint.

109
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:51,994
Can you see the shared screen?

110
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,314
We can, yes.

111
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:54,154
OK.

112
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,115
All right.

113
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:05,357
So as Jim Silver said, this is a short presentation explaining what the Greenland transit area parking zone will be.

114
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:10,278
This is the exact copy of the meeting presentation we gave.

115
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:12,934
as a public information meeting on March 13, 2024.

116
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:18,638
So some of you may have attended that.

117
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:20,899
So if so, this will be a repeat for you.

118
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,121
But others that may not have, this will be the first time.

119
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,103
Hopefully it gives you information about what we're proposing.

120
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:35,725
We're just going to flash up the map fairly quickly just to, again, give an idea of what Jim had alluded to.

121
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:41,006
It's only the area closest to the transit stations located in Medford 1 and Somerville.

122
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:48,628
So it's roughly a quarter mile, not exactly, and it's roughly two to four blocks within the transit stations depending on where you are.

123
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,328
In some cases, one block.

124
00:07:51,048 --> 00:08:00,331
So it's a very small tight knit area within very reasonable walking distance of the transit zones and within each other's each other's streets as well.

125
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:04,153
It's not the larger zone just to this dismiss any.

126
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,160
misinformation about it.

127
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,326
It's not the larger zone that includes South Medford and Hillside, the entire South Medford and Hillside.

128
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:21,655
It's only bordered by Winthrop Street, George Street, Main Street, Bow Street, and then the City Line.

129
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,292
So the project timeline, this just gives you an idea that it's not a new idea.

130
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:36,797
It's not something that we just came up with this year that we're proposing this conversations and start way back at least since 2016, some say even before that.

131
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,718
Hey, Todd, can you advance the slides?

132
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,129
Oh, it didn't.

133
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,391
I advanced mine, but didn't advance.

134
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,993
We're seeing all the slides down the side.

135
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:48,016
If you're using the wrong view.

136
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:51,279
Yeah, I just had the presentation view on and I could see that.

137
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:51,819
OK.

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,920
We couldn't.

139
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:53,601
OK.

140
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,883
You have to change your window if you want to present that.

141
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,466
Okay, which slide do you see right now as large on the screen?

142
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:02,806
Timeline.

143
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:03,847
Timeline.

144
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,588
All right, we'll just leave it like this.

145
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:14,414
So the project timeline, so as far back as 2016 and even before that potentially, there was a study commissioned by the city.

146
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:24,562
It was a private third-party consultant firm that does the stuff for a living, looks at parking studies, and they looked at an on-street residential parking program

147
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:32,384
And out of that process, it recommended some system other than street-by-street parking system.

148
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:41,948
formed this advisory commission called the Commission on Parking Policy and Enforcement.

149
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:50,651
And if Jim or someone else could post that link to the city website for that page into the chat, that might be useful for a lot of people.

150
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,652
So that there was a very in-depth report done in 2020.

151
00:09:55,032 --> 00:10:00,734
And that advisory commission was made up of residents and business owners, not city staff.

152
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,615
City staff is available for resources.

153
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:07,296
but it was made up of several residents and business owners.

154
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:23,319
And they did a lot of legwork and had multiple meetings per week, met with the residents, did surveys, collected data, and they took time out of their busy lives to contribute to the community and recommend parking solutions.

155
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,080
And this is one of their recommendations as well out of that report.

156
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,164
So you can find that at the city's website.

157
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:32,906
In 2021, that report was issued.

158
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,628
The final conclusion that recommended that.

159
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,675
In June 2022, the chief and I held a meeting explaining parking regulation on private ways.

160
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:46,620
Anyone can visit that as well on the city webpage if we post that into the chat as well.

161
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,030
Then in July through September, we had a community meeting about the GLX opening.

162
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:04,272
Then we had some revisions to the processes to try to streamline some of the processes involved in parking, permanent parking.

163
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:15,275
In March 2024, we looked into the adjustment to allow this GL zone, and now we're going into the April 20.

164
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:17,802
So I think one point I want to make is.

165
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:56,551
established as jim mentioned in this zone any street that was not permanent parking through a resident signature process was updated all at once within this zone several months back and so every street in the zone that's being proposed is already resident parking so the list of benefits in that study that was done in 2016-17 as well as from the

166
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:04,847
parking, the Commission on Park Policy and Enforcement lists all these benefits, but we'll say them again.

167
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:15,071
It's preferential access to on-street parking, prevents long-term parking by non-residents or residential street, provides alternative parking locations within short distance.

168
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:22,034
So if your street that you currently live on has term parking is for whatever reason full, you don't have to worry about getting a ticket.

169
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,875
You could park on a neighboring street and you'll be fine.

170
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,957
Obviously, people are gonna prefer to park on their own streets, so we don't foresee

171
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,839
people looking to park on a neighboring street.

172
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,862
It's only in those cases where it's helpful to the people that live in this area.

173
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:49,551
Enforcing by zone is much more efficient and resource efficient for the parking control staff, as well as this traffic commission process, because it eliminates some unnecessary variances that happen each month.

174
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,973
And we might see that on tonight's agenda as well.

175
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,575
Equitable parking, without eliminating the number

176
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:59,657
permits issued, no changes to the current permit system, just like Jim alluded to at the beginning.

177
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:04,538
Pretty much everything will stay the same before and after this proposal.

178
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:11,601
The only difference is you'll have a little more flexibility to park instead of just in your street and neighboring street within the zone.

179
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,101
And they're all very short walking distance from one another.

180
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:19,123
So we don't foresee someone parking on one end to go to another end, because it's only two blocks away.

181
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:24,245
So no change to visitor pass program, same thing as Jim alluded to.

182
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:29,810
The visitor pass would only be valid for the street that you live on.

183
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:38,618
The permit, you could park anywhere in the zone if you have a permit, you're a resident, but the visitor pass would just be on the street that your address is on.

184
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:49,769
And then we'll, this will allow us, you know, we'll collect data and feedback this whole year of the pilot if it's approved, and then we'll revisit the system next year.

185
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,211
Here's the map again, we'll go into a little more detail.

186
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:58,754
Winthrop Street on the west end, which currently has no parking on either side, as people know.

187
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:03,956
George Street on the north end, but it does not include George Street itself.

188
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:10,440
The northeast side, Main Street, that's the border, but it does not include Main Street.

189
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,943
Medford Street includes the west side of Medford Street from Tufts Square up to Magoon Square.

190
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:22,149
It includes Bow Street from Dexter to the City Line.

191
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:34,400
And then the bottom border is essentially Broadway, Somerville, but doesn't include Broadway, and Pearson Road does not include Pearson Road, and the City Line along the Tufts campus along Boston Avenue.

192
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:42,361
The three green symbols here are the transit stations, so you can see how close proximity this area is to that.

193
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:47,344
The pink-red area are streets that currently have pay-to-park.

194
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,145
Those will remain pay-to-park.

195
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,267
The light blue are resident-permanent parking streets.

196
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:57,410
So those are all the public streets that we're speaking of tonight that all already have resident-permanent.

197
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,592
The pink streets in the area, the lighter pink,

198
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:09,915
versus the darker pink of the red, the lighter pink of private ways within the area, and whatever rules exist for private ways will still exist for that.

199
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:14,877
And again, you could go to the city webpage regarding parking on private ways if you need more information about that.

200
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,860
We could refer back to this if people need to at the commission, but that's essentially it.

201
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,961
It's just the areas right near the GLX stations.

202
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:34,817
I think we already touched upon this, what doesn't change, basically everything else stays the same, was before and after.

203
00:15:34,897 --> 00:15:41,419
So the process of how you buy a permit, things like that, the visitor pass process, all that stuff stays the same.

204
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:57,005
The signs themselves will essentially be the same with the exception of a symbol on the sign, likely a G. So whatever street you may be on, if it's 24-7, 24-6, that's what it's gonna remain to be before or after this proposal or if it gets passed.

205
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:03,330
The next steps were here tonight, obviously, that was from the public information.

206
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:12,119
If it got approved, then it would be implemented in July, but it would give us time to order any materials necessary to update the signs.

207
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,324
And then the start date, as Jim alluded to, is July 1st, 2024.

208
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:19,747
And then we re-evaluate about a year later in 2025.

209
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,655
So these were some of the commonly asked questions.

210
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:27,217
And then there were maybe a couple more in the public meeting that we received.

211
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:35,821
I don't want to spend too much time on this, but if the commission members or others want to hear more about this, we can.

212
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:36,921
But I think.

213
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:47,091
Since we had the public information meeting, this is potentially more for the commission members themselves, unless someone happened to not attend that meeting.

214
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:51,516
But there were a lot of questions asked by residents and your neighbors.

215
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:54,119
So we've already answered most of them, we expect.

216
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,362
Certain questions, we've already answered a bunch of them.

217
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:03,829
Lastly, the contact information is jfsilva at medford-ma.gov.

218
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:12,820
As Jim mentioned, there will also be C-Click Fix categories, so that might be the easiest way for folks to just chime in on what they think over the course of the year.

219
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:14,926
That's about it.

220
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,427
I'll just open it up to questions.

221
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:20,410
And these are what the signs could look like.

222
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,211
So these are existing signs in that area.

223
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:29,056
And they would just have the addition of this green decal showing the letter G.

224
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:32,012
Thank you, Director Blake.

225
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:39,256
Jim Silva, quick, do you have anything you want to add to that presentation before I open it up to the commissioners?

226
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:47,581
And as we have done in the past, we'll let the commissioners ask a few questions and then we'll open it up to public comment.

227
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:54,585
I just note you did have a public meeting on this already, and I'm sure some of that feedback will be played into some of these questions.

228
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:57,027
But, Jim, anything further?

229
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:06,833
Yeah, I just want to mention that I've ordered all of the questions and including the chat link with the Traffic Commission members, I believe on the 28th of March.

230
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:12,055
So you should have received that email that had that information and feedback from that meeting.

231
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:13,736
Correct, thank you.

232
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:21,359
To the commissioners, comments, questions of either Todd or Jim Silva.

233
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,456
Jim, you're just referencing some feedback that we received.

234
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:33,377
Can you summarize it for us since the last meeting?

235
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:55,063
When you say summarize, it's basically as detailed, people asking specific questions, specifically enforcement, and the concern certainly about fairness in the program, and people outside of the district and how they were interpreting how they were going to park there.

236
00:18:55,723 --> 00:19:02,888
And so anyone outside of the zone or district would not be, would have to still be issued a visitor pass.

237
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:06,110
Those nuances like that, just sort of clearly.

238
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:12,854
And as we go through this process, and if this is approved, that information again will be forthcoming and sort of reinforced.

239
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:17,637
So those were primarily the enforcement piece was very important.

240
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:22,160
The issue of those who live outside of the zone as well.

241
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,529
Yeah, I'll just add briefly to that.

242
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,451
There were some questions about...

243
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,153
you know, the current levels of enforcement or what they would be before and after this.

244
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,796
And regardless of this, it's independent of this proposal.

245
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:45,922
So whether this gets approved or not, the enforcement levels, we're trying to increase that over time in the city, but it's not tied to this proposal or not.

246
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,263
That's a goal that the city has in general.

247
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:55,068
And then in terms of some, a lot of folks had suggested the use of a sticker to denote who has a permit and who doesn't.

248
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,189
And we said we'd take that under advisement.

249
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,270
But at this time, there's no plans to use a sticker.

250
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:08,653
But again, that question or that policy regarding something like that isn't dependent on this proposal.

251
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,013
So it's independent of this.

252
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:13,495
But that was a common question folks had.

253
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:16,676
Excellent.

254
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:17,596
Commissioners, anything else?

255
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:18,976
Any other questions?

256
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,418
There are a few hands up, but I'd prefer to start with the commissioners.

257
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,165
Can you hear me, Chief?

258
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,866
I can hear you now, Commissioner Brzezinski.

259
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:29,726
You go ahead.

260
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:30,467
All right.

261
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,487
I just have one question.

262
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:38,510
All right, just went bad, Steve.

263
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,012
Hold on.

264
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:44,473
Better?

265
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,513
A little better right there at the end.

266
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:46,894
Yep.

267
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,806
You're in and out, Commissioner Brzezinski.

268
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:21,652
Commissioner Brzezinski, if you can hear us, I'm not sure, but you're not coming through at all.

269
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,269
having a hard time even just muting him.

270
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,013
We'll see if we can figure out his technical difficulties.

271
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:39,396
Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner Flasker, anything before I open it up, public comment?

272
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:46,161
Okay, we'll... Sarah.

273
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,262
Sarah, you have your hand up.

274
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:49,543
You appear first on our screen.

275
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:50,844
Can you unmute yourself?

276
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:53,326
Just give us your name and address.

277
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:56,869
And the floor is yours, welcome.

278
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,145
Sarah, we can't hear you.

279
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:16,589
I just want to turn my phone off.

280
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,810
Sorry, I was trying to call my phone.

281
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,111
I apologize.

282
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:20,931
You're welcome.

283
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:22,392
Please let me know if I'm cutting out.

284
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:24,513
We have you now.

285
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:25,033
Go ahead.

286
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:27,375
Can you hear me now?

287
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:28,135
Yes.

288
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:32,077
Name and address for the record, and then you can proceed.

289
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,019
Can you hear me?

290
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,033
Yes, can you hear us.

291
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,554
I apologize.

292
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:40,374
I just want to.

293
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:42,735
I live on 35 burger Avenue.

294
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:44,936
Some of my neighbors are out of town.

295
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:52,739
I'm not sure if my input will be valuable or not for input, but we strongly disagree on burger Avenue.

296
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:58,902
We already have an ongoing issue with people who do not this being regulated appropriately and

297
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:07,838
As a result, other neighbors parking, now that we have the green line, it's just been increased congestion.

298
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,703
I don't necessarily think all of the presentation and what we discussed in the last meeting was accurately described.

299
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:18,267
I just want to verbalize that communication.

300
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:22,671
Thank you for your comments and for your participation.

301
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:24,052
I appreciate it.

302
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:27,595
Chief, can we ask her what was not accurately described?

303
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:34,802
you know, can we have to ask you to unmute?

304
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,603
Yeah, we have to get you to unmute again.

305
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:40,904
Sorry, I just I'm used to like in work meetings when you have to mute yourself every time.

306
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:52,027
Um, I think it was described that we were all in agreement and that these about the discussions we had and it was not 100% supportive from the last previous the previous meeting.

307
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:59,469
And there were some suggestions for things that neighbors who have lived here for 30 plus years, what has worked and um,

308
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:03,827
I don't necessarily think that was accurately depicted in the presentation.

309
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:13,199
I have lived in other areas, which I said in the last meeting, where this has gone into effect, and it does impact

310
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:16,875
the people who live on those streets and communities.

311
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:30,349
So saying people aren't going to drive four streets over when there's a blizzard or their car gets then trapped on a street near the green line, are real huge concerns for us because we do not have that problem right now.

312
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:35,114
And yeah, we're worried about that.

313
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:36,445
Yeah.

314
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:41,351
So can I ask real quick, is there a larger portion of this an enforcement question?

315
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:45,356
Because I mean, we do have two divisions and we're going to have to pick that up.

316
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,419
And I say that as chief of police.

317
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,241
It's honestly, it's a combination.

318
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:53,346
I just want to mention that it's also the enforcement as well.

319
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:53,726
But it

320
00:24:56,075 --> 00:25:01,080
Even if it's an enforcement, there was comments that people aren't going to pull a couple streets over for this or that.

321
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,383
And I'm not sure where they receive their data from.

322
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:11,430
I've lived in Boston and Brooklyn and other communities where this has happened and that data is not accurate.

323
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:13,652
Okay, thank you.

324
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,449
I appreciate it.

325
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:18,111
Thanks for your comment and thanks for participation.

326
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:21,855
El Rocco, we have you next.

327
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,177
We're going to ask you to unmute.

328
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,400
Just introduce yourself, name and address for the record.

329
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,201
Hi, yeah.

330
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,723
I live on University Ave.

331
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:31,967
And what does that mean?

332
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,188
We have a private street.

333
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:34,289
It's a dead-end street.

334
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:41,219
And it's bad enough that we have the college students parking on the street that they should not be parking on the street.

335
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,963
So what does that mean regarding the T station?

336
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:47,766
Are you saying anybody can park on University Ave now?

337
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:52,931
Director Blake, I think that's probably best for you to respond.

338
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:55,454
I think it's pretty straightforward.

339
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:58,397
If University Ave is a private way,

340
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:11,717
whatever rules exist for private way that that still would exist this this proposal wouldn't change anything on university app whatsoever so university of it's a private way any private way in this zone has the ability to

341
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:24,457
create their own parking rules in terms of permits and visitors and post it, their own signs and enforce it as often as they want to with a third party.

342
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:34,227
So actually private way owners in that respect for parking anyways, have much more control, direct control over enforcement and signage on their own street.

343
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:43,897
So you could restrict it a private way, could restrict it to just private way residents and nobody else, and they can enforce it with the tow company.

344
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:47,519
Well, wouldn't that be the city of Medford to do that?

345
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,822
What do you, why do you mean the residents of the university?

346
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,743
Yeah, that's the city of Medford.

347
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,444
They're going to have to reinforce that.

348
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,219
I thought I heard you say that it was a private way and you lived on a private way.

349
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,560
If that's the case, then.

350
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,021
Yeah, there's a private way.

351
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:12,423
So I posted in the chat www.medfordma.org slash department slash parking slash parking on private ways.

352
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:15,024
That'll answer all your questions regarding private ways.

353
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:20,446
I'm just trying to clarify that the parking on private way, this proposal for the,

354
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:29,111
Green Line Zone for resident-prone parking will not change anything like the day before it's approved or not and the day after it's approved or not.

355
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,332
It won't change anything for you on University Ave.

356
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,934
Okay.

357
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:35,635
Thank you for your participation.

358
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:37,417
Sergeant, you want to go to the next ECM thing?

359
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,398
Rich Moretti.

360
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm going to unmute.

361
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:42,861
Unmute.

362
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:47,504
Give us the name and address, Mr. Rich Moretti.

363
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,265
Hello, Rich Moretti, 126 Burgadow.

364
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,418
You guys are laser-focused on the GLX parking.

365
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,563
The dead-end portion of Burgett Ave has another issue altogether.

366
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:00,926
We have tough students in the area.

367
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:04,510
This is why we went to permits long before the GLX project began.

368
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,395
Our street always has and always will be the preferred street for tough students again.

369
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,398
We had this issue for years.

370
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,259
Students that lived right on Greenleaf have a block and a half away.

371
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,964
They'd come down, park down the end of the street, and every day I'd come home from work, just street lined with students' cars.

372
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,146
And these are all students that live in the area.

373
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,047
They're not coming from out of state or another city.

374
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,169
These are students that live within this zone.

375
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,671
They're college students, and they're lazy.

376
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,112
I got a couple of kids, college students.

377
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:32,853
They don't want to walk if they don't have to.

378
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:35,615
And I think this is going to be a huge problem for us down here.

379
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:38,237
OK.

380
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,906
Do you have a, Todd, any response or?

381
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,428
Yeah, I have a quick response.

382
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:50,152
I mean, I could share my screen again, just so we get a little perspective here.

383
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:58,518
And, you know, and these concerns about, we're not saying anyone's concern is invalid, but I'm trying to see.

384
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:07,425
Basically, my point was gonna be that, you know, there are many streets within,

385
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,851
that are actually closer to many addresses on Burgadab itself.

386
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:17,013
So that the- Yeah, I'm telling you from personal experience though, I've lived here my whole life.

387
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,754
Can I speak for a sec?

388
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:19,754
Yeah.

389
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:27,677
I just wanna, so Hume is closer to the dead end of Burgadab than several blocks of Burgadab are.

390
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:32,719
So I'm just saying the current process, it's outlined by street address.

391
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,181
But it doesn't necessarily mean the houses closest to that area.

392
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:39,524
Because Hume, that's why I wanted to bring up Google Maps.

393
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:53,474
Hume, Sunset Ave, Greenleaf are all closer to the dead end portion of Burgadab than 106 Burgadab, or number 10, number 14, number 9, number 13, number 16, the Burgadab houses closest to George Street.

394
00:29:55,075 --> 00:30:03,977
It's, this just enables those on Sunset or Hume that are closer distance-wise to the dead end than the other ends of Burgett Avenue to also be able to utilize that area.

395
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:08,657
Again, they're not necessarily gonna look to use those sections of street.

396
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:10,438
People are gonna park closest to their house.

397
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:14,298
It doesn't mean that it'll never happen, but it's, think about where you park.

398
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,259
You're likely gonna try to park near your house.

399
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:23,180
You're only gonna seek other areas if it's full in your area, but it's making it equitable and fair.

400
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,282
You know, it just gives more options to the people that already live there.

401
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:28,884
These aren't outsides, they're your neighbors.

402
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,165
They already live in this area.

403
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:36,350
So Hume, as I said, so the dead end portion of Hume, I wanted to have this on there.

404
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,832
So dead end portion of Hume is 367 feet.

405
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:44,778
So house number 89, Hume is 462 feet away from the dead end.

406
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,900
Yet, Birgit Ave house number 89,

407
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:51,903
10 is 1,500 feet away from the Denver gap.

408
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:58,206
The 1,500 feet away number 10 is allowed to park at that end of the gap, but the Hume folks aren't.

409
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:03,908
It's just the way the system is structured, it doesn't necessarily follow logic currently.

410
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:10,291
So this is a parking policy that's very common in other cities and towns throughout the region.

411
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:17,295
And it's the street by street is actually the most uncommon system in the region, if not the country.

412
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,777
So we're just trying to update metrics to current standards.

413
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:25,521
And I get that there's resistance and some fear associated with that.

414
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:27,462
That's why it's a pilot.

415
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:28,203
We can revisit it.

416
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:32,306
If all of a sudden, all your fears come true, then we can have that discussion next year.

417
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:33,927
That's what I would say to that.

418
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:35,329
Thank you.

419
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,250
And Mr. Murray, thank you for your participation.

420
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,271
Sajid, next.

421
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:40,673
Lisa Ranallo.

422
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,343
to ask you to unmute, give us your name and address, please, for the record.

423
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,225
Hi, thank you for letting me speak.

424
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:50,586
Lisa Rinella, 12 Stearns Avenue, Medford.

425
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:53,749
I've lived here my whole life, grown up, and now I have a family here.

426
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:59,813
I agree with some of the comments and the concerns that the residents have had, especially Sarah.

427
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:11,862
I just wish that Medford residents would be considered because I think that it's going to be very chaotic for individuals that have chosen to buy property here in Medford,

428
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,166
and live here in Medford.

429
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:22,528
And I just wish that everyone would give the residents some preference because we choose to live here.

430
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:23,989
We're not just students.

431
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:25,909
We're not just commuting.

432
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,070
We're not just coming to the city to work.

433
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:33,332
I do believe that, you know, winter months are very difficult here.

434
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:39,056
in Medford, neighbors that are neighborly during the summer kind of turn on you.

435
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:44,177
And I just have some of the same concerns that I've heard other longtime residents.

436
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:50,658
And I'm just afraid that once this goes on as a pilot, we will not have an opportunity to turn back.

437
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:55,379
I do appreciate being given the opportunity to speak and voice my concerns.

438
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,019
Thank you.

439
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,020
I appreciate your comments and your participation.

440
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,781
So just unmute yourself if you have a comment.

441
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,581
Otherwise, I'm just going to move on to the next speaker.

442
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:13,063
Yeah, Eunice, we're going to ask you to unmute and just state your name and address for the record.

443
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:13,604
Welcome.

444
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:24,244
Hi, thanks Eunice brown green leaf have totally in agreement with the previous speakers who all live in the surrounding streets to me.

445
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:30,929
We are a very clogged street as it is with cars.

446
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:34,912
We have several many 2 and 3 families.

447
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:41,935
And many of the residents have multiple cars, so it makes it very clogged as it is.

448
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:52,900
We may or may not still have students parking on the street, which is the reason why we got permit parking back in the spring of.

449
00:33:54,401 --> 00:34:01,788
2021 in the 1st place, but we can't really tell who belongs here or not because there are no stickers.

450
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:05,431
So the idea of getting rid of those, we can't tell.

451
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,855
Who's on the street in the 1st place that belongs there.

452
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:25,041
and allowing other streets to, when they don't have parking available, to park on Greenleaf is going to clog an already very clogged street as it is.

453
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:33,807
And my understanding is that we're known by the Medford Fire Department as one of the worst streets in the city to navigate.

454
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:41,450
And I think that became very apparent when there was a very large fire on green leaf just before Christmas.

455
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,172
So, for those all of those reasons, I vehemently oppose this.

456
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:50,354
And the other thing that I would mention is.

457
00:34:52,226 --> 00:35:03,730
I don't think I have ever seen, or at least not in quite some time parking enforcement coming through the streets.

458
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:09,612
I know that's not necessarily your bailiwick, but if they're not patrolling.

459
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,680
You know, what good is it doing?

460
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:31,390
I'd be interested in, excuse me, submitting a public records request to them to find out what their actual routes are, how frequently they patrol their routes, and are they actually patrolling them?

461
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,853
Because I haven't seen anybody down here at all in heaven knows how long.

462
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:35,913
So,

463
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:51,983
I'm, I'm strongly opposed to this, but I mean, it's pretty apparent listening to the conversation from the city folks tonight and I watched some of the last meeting as well on replay.

464
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:59,988
This is going to pass no matter what and regarding what the speaker prior to me said.

465
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:13,874
is that even though it's a pilot program and we can revisit it in a year, I don't have any faith that no matter what the residents say, once we start this, we're in it forever.

466
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:17,796
So I'm sorry, but this is a bad idea.

467
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:18,476
Thank you.

468
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:20,557
Unis, thank you for the comments.

469
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:22,018
Thank you for your participation.

470
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,119
I can't comment on enforcement to one degree.

471
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:41,805
I have my two sergeants here who handle the traffic division and I bring them here for the very important reason to hear people like you say that they need enforcement because they can also do certain parking enforcements and they take notes and they can kind of address the issues and they know I'm here listening too.

472
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:44,366
So I expect some sort of response out of that.

473
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:47,827
So hopefully, at least from the police side of things, we can give you a little bit more.

474
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:50,290
response to that.

475
00:36:50,590 --> 00:37:00,143
I'm going to ask you on mute and then just state your name and address.

476
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,662
Okay, I'm Maria Stella Cocchiara.

477
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:07,284
I live at 3610 Le Havre.

478
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:20,374
And although we have a driveway, the number of streets of cars in the street is very, very high.

479
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:25,718
And on both sides of the street, especially in the winter,

480
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:30,039
parking becomes very difficult.

481
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:49,206
You opened the meeting by saying that the street-by-street has been changed to a zone because it's more efficient, because it is the thing that other communities around here are doing, because you will be able to better enforce the system.

482
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:50,086
However,

483
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:52,947
not the whole city is going under this.

484
00:37:53,027 --> 00:38:00,910
If it's so beneficial, why are you limiting this system to the area around the GLX?

485
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:07,193
One, the enforcement on our street on Stanley Ave is non-existent.

486
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,534
Students that park

487
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:15,359
and have guests for not just hours, but days.

488
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:26,368
And City Hall has been called that these students are parking here for days and weeks, and nothing has been done to enforce that parking.

489
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:31,033
So it leads me to believe that this is only going to get worse, never better.

490
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:44,074
When the GLX was being approved and built, in other words, the last several years, we were assured that things in the community wouldn't change.

491
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:47,375
Well, they have changed and they continue to change.

492
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:53,937
And like the person before me said, nothing is giving us any confidence that even the one year

493
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,883
trial, thank you, the one-year trial is going to be to make any difference.

494
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:18,386
We are already assuming that this is law and that no one is really considering what's happening on these streets and to us.

495
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:25,468
Thank you for your comment.

496
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:30,250
We appreciate it and just move on here at NAD.

497
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,615
you on mute and just state your name and address for the record, please.

498
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,176
Hi, yes, thank you.

499
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,317
Nadine Moretti, Burgadow.

500
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:43,317
Can you hear me okay?

501
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:44,498
Yes, we can.

502
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:45,178
Good afternoon.

503
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:45,939
Okay, great.

504
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:46,479
Thank you.

505
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:47,079
Good afternoon.

506
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,100
I am in Chiming Inn.

507
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,982
I live on the dead end of Burgadow and

508
00:39:55,042 --> 00:40:02,408
We already have an issue with parking on this road, especially down this dead end with the students of Tufts.

509
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:12,023
We are constantly seeing students park their cars and leave to go to their classes for however many hours of the day.

510
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:18,866
It's been an ongoing problem, hence the reason why we also got the permit parking.

511
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:23,929
It doesn't seem to stop anybody from choosing to do this though.

512
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:30,392
And it's been an ongoing problem for as long as I've been here and I've lived here for 21 years.

513
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:41,694
And so to add the threat of more people being able to park here for the day while they go to work and take up our spaces in front of our homes.

514
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,720
It's just an unfair, it's an unfair ask.

515
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:58,030
I really don't understand, and I have to agree with the previous callers, that the pilot program could all be well and done in a year, but it is not going to change anything.

516
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,933
I think that before this can even, or should have been considered,

517
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:07,068
The parking permits and the parking issues that we have, especially on burgundy.

518
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:13,653
You know, should be taken care of and we can call the parking people and things are never done.

519
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,614
So, it really is a big concern to think of.

520
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:23,359
People coming here and parking for the day, or rather green line users rather and.

521
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,626
you know, as losing our parking spaces in front of our own homes.

522
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:31,149
So I'm really 100% opposed to this as well.

523
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:38,676
And I wish that there was something different that could be proposed, especially in light of all the people speaking against this.

524
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:46,262
So again, the problem on the dead end of Burgadave remains, I don't think it's ever going to get better, it's just going to get worse.

525
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:51,387
So this is a huge concern, and I'm completely opposed to this proposal.

526
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:55,357
Thank you very much.

527
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:56,539
Thank you.

528
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,441
We appreciate that.

529
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:58,523
Okay.

530
00:41:58,704 --> 00:41:59,045
Thank you.

531
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:05,417
So that is it for the hands are being raised that I can see.

532
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:08,639
I'd like to bounce it back to the commissioners.

533
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,763
So, yeah, Jordan, I just had a quick thought to share.

534
00:42:15,123 --> 00:42:27,972
We do value residents' comments, but if we took a tally of who spoke so far, which again, the comments are valid, and we appreciate you attending and giving your thoughts, but

535
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:35,818
Just as someone mentioned, I don't think I said everyone was in agreement in the meeting, but we were just highlighting what was discussed.

536
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:40,762
But if we tally up who spoke so far, a number of people are from Burgadav, obviously, right?

537
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:48,388
But as a city, we make decisions for the whole community, not necessarily just for one street.

538
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:49,750
So obviously, Burgadav has

539
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:56,938
you know, concerns and those are valid, but we got to look at other streets that may not have any parking at all.

540
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:58,700
Like Winthrop Street has no parking at all.

541
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,803
College Ave has no parking at all in some stretches.

542
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:05,027
So the current system, those people would come here

543
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:16,576
request a variance to park on one of the side streets that we're talking about anyways, and then the commission has to, in the current system, select one of those streets for those folks to go park on.

544
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:22,984
And then that one street gets overloaded, and then the problems kind of domino effect into the neighboring street.

545
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:37,252
So this is taking a more holistic neighborhood approach to think of those other streets that may not be speaking up or may not be in attendance that have issues in the sense that they don't even have the option to park on this street.

546
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:48,318
So we're just trying to highlight that for folks that, and again, we appreciate people showing up and not trying to be argumentative or anything with people from Burgerdap.

547
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,719
It's just highlighting that that's one streets, one perspective.

548
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:57,704
So we got to look at the whole of all of this system.

549
00:43:58,645 --> 00:44:10,097
Any issues regarding lack of enforcement or people that don't have permits that are there for a long time, they're not getting ticketed, those exist even if this didn't come forward as a proposal, right?

550
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,239
So it's independent of this process.

551
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,203
In terms of the green line and the parking getting worse,

552
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:30,788
One of the tools the city has, like Medford, is to have a resident-prone parking program so that we block out non-Medford residents from driving from Arlington, Belmont, wherever, to park near the Green Line, to hop on the T for the whole day.

553
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:37,010
So that's why we have a system like resident-prone parking, to restrict it to just Medford residents, to help Medford residents.

554
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:45,031
So this is kind of being discussed as something anti-Medford resident, and a permanent parking program is for Medford residents.

555
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,172
So I just wanted to highlight some of those things.

556
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:50,912
Appreciate everyone's comments and time that they've taken to attend the meeting.

557
00:44:58,534 --> 00:44:58,894
Hey, Todd.

558
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:00,394
Thank you, Todd.

559
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:01,574
Appreciate it.

560
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:02,855
We do have a couple more hands up.

561
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:13,321
Council of the commissioners if you want to speak on this or if you want me to continue with the public comment.

562
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:15,489
Jordan, let's continue.

563
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:31,839
I want to continue the public comment, but I just want to ask a couple of clarifying questions to Todd, because from what it sounded like, I'm not sure if everybody understands what we're trying to do here, because we're not inviting more users to the area, to the G area.

564
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,381
The city wouldn't be planning on doing that.

565
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,562
It's actually doing the opposite.

566
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:36,743
It's restricting users.

567
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:46,888
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you have a permit today, you live on a permanent streets, this system means you're going to have a permit in the future as well, just going to be a little bit different.

568
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:55,992
Then the other thing I think you already touched upon, that enforcement issues, sure, they exist and we acknowledge them, I believe.

569
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:59,874
But we're not talking about enforcement right now.

570
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:04,977
This is something different and this actually should make enforcement easier.

571
00:46:06,866 --> 00:46:09,107
That has to do with the more efficient piece we talked about earlier.

572
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:26,881
Then as far as students parking, this should help that issue too because if they don't have permits, so they don't live in Medford or whatever, then this would restrict them from parking on Burgett like it is today.

573
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,723
But again, that goes back to an enforcement piece.

574
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:34,927
This is going to have to be enforced just like the current situation needs to be enforced for it to be effective.

575
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:42,901
I just wanted to bring up the Google map to share.

576
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:45,602
I'm trying to come up with the correct terminology.

577
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:50,304
You can kind of look at it as glass half full, glass half empty type thing.

578
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:53,986
A lot of comments are like this end of Burgadab, if you can see that hopefully.

579
00:46:55,146 --> 00:47:00,110
is the desired section, I guess, of Burgett Ave, because it's the closest as the crow flies to the Green Lines.

580
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:12,058
So what I was pointing out earlier today, or earlier in the meeting, is a house way up here near George Street currently has a permit for Burgett, so they could, you know, the fear, drive down here and park over here instead.

581
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,521
But this person, Humab, which is actually closer, cannot.

582
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:31,131
But if in those chances, in those times when this is full for someone who lives in say number 132, right now, you only have the option to look on Burgett and you might end up having to park up near number 22 or up near George Street.

583
00:47:31,491 --> 00:47:35,994
But in this system, you'd be able to park right on the corner on Hume or Sunset.

584
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:42,256
Each time we're looking at the potential negative, but we're not looking at the positive side of the equation.

585
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:54,478
So if you find yourself in trouble parking at the dead end of Burger Avenue or your house, you yourself could park on Hume or Sunset, which is closer to your house than Greenleaf or Chester or way up near George Street.

586
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:57,259
So there's two sides to this coin.

587
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:58,739
You can look at it both ways, right?

588
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:01,140
And we're focusing on one end of it right now, it seems.

589
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,140
Yeah.

590
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:11,759
The last thing I want to say before I go back to public is that I know that I, for one, am very much interested in this being a pilot, because there are going to be issues.

591
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:18,681
The whole purpose of a pilot is to make sure we're paying attention, understand what the issues are, so we can try to resolve those issues.

592
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:23,283
Or there is the option of scrapping the whole program if it just doesn't work.

593
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:25,184
We don't think that's going to happen.

594
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:31,927
But the pilot program, the purpose of that is to understand what issues arise during implementation, which are hard to foresee.

595
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:40,094
Thank you, Commissioner McKibbin and Todd, and we'll go back to public comment.

596
00:48:40,114 --> 00:48:51,839
I think Jenny, Lynn's iPhone, and then we have Carol's iPad, Sarah, Nadine, we have you guys, so I'll just ask you to unmute, and please just state your name and address.

597
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,421
Hi, my name is Jane Lynn Pagan.

598
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:59,603
My address is 459 Broadway, Medford, Mass.

599
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:10,846
And I was just curious, is Strathmore, Braemore and Killsite streets going to be affected within the pilot program?

600
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:17,868
That would probably be, or Jim, that would probably be.

601
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:26,074
To your question, those streets are part of the resident parking program.

602
00:49:26,155 --> 00:49:28,637
So you're at 459 Broadway.

603
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:33,063
You currently have your variances to park on Bow Street.

604
00:49:35,227 --> 00:49:37,590
No, my variance is to park on brain more.

605
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,912
I'm the exemption.

606
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:40,073
I'm a corner lot.

607
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:47,722
Okay, so that allows you to park on brain more still and then obviously, if there isn't parking on brain more, you can park on bow.

608
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:50,666
Dexter kill sites.

609
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:53,469
So you have some options, so you're not.

610
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,495
I think maybe at some point, you might come home and not find a place to park on that street.

611
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:06,342
So you have looked for parking that you may have actually been ticketed, et cetera.

612
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:10,225
This will give you an opportunity to park on some of the other streets in the area.

613
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:16,672
So I'm not sure if you're familiar with the South Medford, that area?

614
00:50:17,452 --> 00:50:18,754
I live in South Medford, yes.

615
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:30,169
Okay, so do you live within those streets because if you lived on braymore road You would know that there's four exemptions on that street because there's four corner lots.

616
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,552
Yep Two on bow two on broadway.

617
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:46,243
There's also two handicap parking exemptions on that street And I have four kids so i'm not Going to want to park three streets over to park

618
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:50,532
So I can walk to bring more road.

619
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:59,124
You know, that that that's ridiculous and I appreciate your comment.

620
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:08,223
So I don't think we're suggesting you would have to walk that far, right?

621
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:18,766
We're saying that if the chance, if the case arises where you're only allowed to park on Braymont and there are no spaces available, what do you do in that case?

622
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,566
You circle the block until you find one.

623
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:26,528
This program would enable you to park like around the corner to one street on a different street.

624
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:29,149
So it's to help you, not to hurt you.

625
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:35,292
No, no, because how it works is perfect because there's no issues, okay?

626
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:36,913
You don't know our street.

627
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:44,357
The people across the street, they have Parkinson's and an elderly woman who needs a wheelchair.

628
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:48,940
The people next to us on the first floor, they have a chemo patient.

629
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,902
Their parents come down and take care of them multiple times a week.

630
00:51:53,961 --> 00:52:01,670
but they can't use their driveway because the people on the third floor is an Airbnb, so they have privilege to their driveway.

631
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:07,657
The second floor is a single mom with two kids, so she deserves to park in front of her house.

632
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:12,202
The people next to them, the first floor is an elderly couple.

633
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:19,411
who rent out their second floor and allow the people to park in their driveway.

634
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:22,192
They still need parking in front of their house.

635
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:29,495
The people down the street have a handicapped child who need privilege to park in front of their house.

636
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:37,195
So if I may, ma'am, these are good points you're bringing up, but we have existing programs that could help a lot of these issues.

637
00:52:37,836 --> 00:52:39,196
What programs are there?

638
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,057
Because I don't know those programs.

639
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:52,821
If I may, there's a program that you can request to get an accessible parking space sign near a house of someone that has needs and shows that they have a plaque or a plate.

640
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:58,403
So then that would ensure them to have a accessible space very close to the house, if not in front of their house.

641
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:05,268
So there are programs like that that exist that many of the people that you just mentioned, the examples, could benefit from something like that.

642
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:13,322
So basically, Braymore Road will become full of handicapped spaces, but I am a tenant with four kids.

643
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:28,485
So I have one parking space, but my husband, who works multiple shifts, who needs to park on this street, so he should park on three streets over because someone on Strathmore couldn't find parking and they need to park in front of my house.

644
00:53:30,686 --> 00:53:31,446
How does that work?

645
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,189
How is that fair?

646
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,991
I think we haven't mentioned this earlier.

647
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:39,113
This is a good conversation to have.

648
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:47,219
We haven't mentioned this in terms of, you know, there's some impression, and this isn't just South Metro, this jail zone, this is like citywide.

649
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,199
Does this,

650
00:53:49,280 --> 00:54:02,530
kind of understanding this expectation of having the parking space in front of your house and the density that exists in the car ownership that exists in Medford, the number of spaces on the street does not afford that to happen.

651
00:54:03,011 --> 00:54:12,098
So policies like resident parking exists to weed out the non-Medford residents to only have you compete with Medford residents and not other people.

652
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:15,781
Because if we didn't have that policy, you'd be competing with people from Somerville and everywhere else.

653
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:22,164
So, the number of on-street spaces is not enough to guarantee everyone a spot on the street.

654
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:22,804
It's just not.

655
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:27,966
And it's just with car ownership over time, over the decades, that's the way it's gone.

656
00:54:28,346 --> 00:54:32,888
It's not anything bad about Medford or any Medford residents per se at all.

657
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:38,331
What we're trying to explain in your particular area, in any areas that

658
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:41,373
these issues, challenges exist.

659
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:51,182
The current system is that the traffic commission could grant a variance to say someone in Sherbrooke Court to park either at Strathmore or Braymore or Bow Street.

660
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:52,523
That already exists today.

661
00:54:53,324 --> 00:55:05,574
So instead of the traffic commission deciding which street that variance should park on, by having a zone, it allows that supply and demand to reach an equilibrium.

662
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:16,119
So if the traffic commission, for instance, I'm not saying they would, but if over time there's enough variances and they added five variances to Braymore, you'd have more of an issue, right?

663
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:24,203
But if it wasn't dedicated to just Braymore and it was allowed to all those streets, it would be able to spread out and go where it's available.

664
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,864
So do you see what we're saying?

665
00:55:25,904 --> 00:55:33,532
Like these existing processes might contribute to more congestion on one street versus another.

666
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:36,274
This is kind of spreading it out within the neighborhood.

667
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,957
It's not meant to hurt anyone or make it worse.

668
00:55:39,037 --> 00:55:39,898
It's meant to help.

669
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:45,068
Sherbourne Court, first of all, has parking.

670
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:49,611
The tenants just don't want to pay for the extra parking for their parking spot.

671
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:58,558
So they'd rather pay the $10 to park on Bow and then just try to park on Bow or Strathmore.

672
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm sorry, Braymore or Strathmore.

673
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:05,363
Now, if I could interrupt Sergeant Rogers.

674
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:10,227
The numerous people in Sherbourne Court and on Broadway

675
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:19,025
are forced to park on Bow Street because there is extremely limited parking on Braymore, Strathmore, and Killsife.

676
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:32,250
This program will now bring everyone on Broadway be able to park on Braymore, Strathmore, and Killsife, and there'll be absolutely no room for the residents of these streets.

677
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:37,772
They will put down on the Bow Street because Bow Street can handle the overflow and parking.

678
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:40,273
These side streets cannot handle it.

679
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:46,450
So the variances were for Bow Street only.

680
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:52,575
This program will now flood the side streets.

681
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:57,639
And the residents of those streets will have nowhere to park.

682
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:05,746
Right, so we have a couple more hands here.

683
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:10,153
We'll get through them and then we'll go back to the commissioners.

684
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:10,974
So Carol.

685
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:13,354
Can I just ask one clarifying question on that?

686
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,575
Go ahead, give it a shot.

687
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:26,736
Are the residents of Broadway automatically allowed to get, they're not automatically allowed under this new program that Broadway is the border.

688
00:57:27,217 --> 00:57:30,357
Are the residents of Broadway able to get parking permits?

689
00:57:30,897 --> 00:57:34,738
Because we know we can't give them parking permits on Broadway because that's a Somerville street.

690
00:57:36,209 --> 00:57:44,616
So they will get a variance, Alicia, because these apartments are in Medford.

691
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:48,359
So I guess my question is about this program.

692
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:52,722
They would still need to come get a variance to be able to park on a Medford street.

693
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:58,146
And would the variance be for one street or would it be for the whole area?

694
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:02,650
If this program is full, they'll be able to park anywhere in that zone.

695
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,101
So Alicia, we're honoring variances.

696
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:13,245
There's no change to the variance and the variance has already been granted for that you speak of.

697
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:19,629
So yes, as Sergeant Rogers alluded to, they would have the availability of parking in the zone.

698
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,491
That's existing variances.

699
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:25,893
A new person moves in, they'd still have to come get a variance.

700
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:30,676
Variance is based on the address, not individual.

701
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:31,957
Correct.

702
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:40,514
So if your address is a Medford address within the zone, you should be eligible for a permit.

703
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:46,296
Not necessarily a visitor, because visitor on Broadway, we don't control the space on Broadway, right?

704
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:53,339
But a sticker or a permit, then if they're Medford residents within the zone, they would be eligible.

705
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:56,094
That's the weird thing.

706
00:58:56,654 --> 00:59:04,320
Most of those Broadway, the houses are in Medford, but their addresses, a lot of them, their addresses are actually Somerville.

707
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:09,143
It's a very unusual situation.

708
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:20,111
Alicia, it was always Somerville until 9-1-1, obviously, and a lot of things had changed since then.

709
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:27,173
And the post office required the exact city where your property lied in.

710
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:30,035
And a lot of them had to change back to Medford.

711
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:36,398
And Alicia, the parking program goes by the assessor's office.

712
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:39,120
And so those buildings are Medford.

713
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:47,244
And as Todd alluded to, because they are on Broadway, we cannot issue visitor passes on Broadway.

714
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,886
They can only have resident parking in the zone.

715
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:12,703
Okay, so we'll go through to Carol's iPad, unless the commissioners have anything else we want to keep flowing through here.

716
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,664
It seems like we got a couple of heads up.

717
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:25,850
So I'll just ask you to unmute Carol and you can speak your name and address for the commissioners, please.

718
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:26,750
Hello?

719
01:00:27,451 --> 01:00:28,591
Hey, good evening.

720
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:29,031
Can you hear me?

721
01:00:29,572 --> 01:00:29,832
We do.

722
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:32,757
Okay, Carol Galoni, I'm on St.

723
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:34,318
Clement's Road in Medford.

724
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:52,461
And we have a unique problem here because we not only have the tough students that park in our street because of the academic program right across the street, we also have a very active church community now that has something going on six to seven days a week.

725
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,202
And we have Semolina's restaurant.

726
01:00:56,481 --> 01:01:01,282
And we are also surrounded mainly by Somerville streets.

727
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:08,284
And it's a pretty known fact that if you park on the Medford sides, you get no ticket.

728
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:10,644
If you park in Somerville, you get a ticket.

729
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:13,505
And there is no enforcement.

730
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:15,946
And I know this is something that's been brought up.

731
01:01:16,526 --> 01:01:21,447
But we have also called many times when there have been cars parked here several days.

732
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:24,769
and there's no enforcement of that.

733
01:01:25,469 --> 01:01:30,272
Now with this zoning, what I anticipate is we already have a problem.

734
01:01:31,033 --> 01:01:40,859
Bristol Road is very congested, so people up there already come down here to park and they never get ticketed, so that's not gonna change.

735
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:43,641
So if you can't find a place on St.

736
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:48,404
Clements Road, your only alternative is Bristol Road or Boston Avenue.

737
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:52,105
And most of the time, there's no parking spaces there.

738
01:01:52,165 --> 01:01:57,487
And if it's in the winter, you can't park on Boston Ave if it's a snow emergency.

739
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,828
And to think that somebody from St.

740
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:12,272
Clements Road or Bristol Road is going to go walk under the Harvard Street Bridge and go down into the South Medford streets to find a parking space and then walk back home is unrealistic.

741
01:02:13,337 --> 01:02:24,129
And my other question that I've asked several times and I've never given the answer to it is, what other city or town has permit parking without issuing stickers?

742
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:30,036
Does anybody know?

743
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:37,635
My silence tells me that there aren't any.

744
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:50,366
And if, you know, living right next to Somerville, I mean, the people that go to church here, they get upset when they park on Warner Street because they're not even there five minutes and they get a ticket.

745
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:55,550
Somerville is very active in enforcing, and the tough students know that.

746
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:58,073
We've had tough students tell us that.

747
01:02:59,155 --> 01:03:02,876
So, I mean, I'm not sure why St.

748
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:05,417
Clements Road was included in this.

749
01:03:05,778 --> 01:03:24,725
The only benefit is that you're gonna have people that are gonna come from other parts of the city, even though you say they're not, they're gonna park here and walk up to the green line because they're not gonna wait and go, like someone said last meeting, in the winter or bad weather, walk,

750
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:30,028
10 to 15 minutes when they can park here and just walk up the street.

751
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:42,674
So I really don't see any benefit that this is going to have for our street other than it just adds another layer of traffic that we have to deal with all the time.

752
01:03:43,935 --> 01:03:44,415
Thank you.

753
01:03:45,976 --> 01:03:46,997
Thank you for your comments.

754
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:50,907
The misunderstanding is continuing out there.

755
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:54,467
If someone from another part of the city wouldn't be able to park in St.

756
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:58,869
Clements, so it's only someone in the zone would be able to park on St.

757
01:03:58,889 --> 01:03:59,209
Clements.

758
01:03:59,629 --> 01:04:01,289
So I just wanted to clear that up.

759
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:02,949
Can I address?

760
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,330
I want to address the enforcement.

761
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,330
Go ahead.

762
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:09,331
Commissioners, Sergeant Rogers again.

763
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:13,692
As far as the enforcement goes, we do our best.

764
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:17,313
My traffic cars go to all accidents.

765
01:04:18,911 --> 01:04:28,758
calls backing up the sector cars, and I will assign them specific areas, mostly which I get on C-Clicket.

766
01:04:30,219 --> 01:04:35,363
I'm relying on the parking department to do the resident parking as well.

767
01:04:36,484 --> 01:04:38,505
We respond when we get a complaint.

768
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:46,811
If we have time, I will assign certain streets, again, if we have time.

769
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:49,543
So that's the enforcement.

770
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:56,107
Sarah, you have your hand up.

771
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:04,272
I just don't know if it's from before, or if you have another question, I'll just ask you to unmute.

772
01:05:04,752 --> 01:05:08,195
Yes, I just wanted another comment from listening to others.

773
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:11,917
First of all, I want to say thank you to the police department.

774
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:16,500
And I don't think any of us are saying we don't want you to respond to things more urgent than parking.

775
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:21,788
I know I'm a nurse and that's for sure not my intent.

776
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:37,677
But I do want to reiterate, and while I hear globally what the commission is trying to state, but we all live where we live and I won't just speak to my own street, I'll speak to all the others.

777
01:05:38,198 --> 01:05:43,921
We have figured out what works and it works to the best of our ability.

778
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:44,922
We're not saying,

779
01:05:46,168 --> 01:05:50,550
I think Tim commented about reminding us that we're not talking about other aspects of the city.

780
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:51,950
I'm not talking about that either.

781
01:05:52,210 --> 01:06:04,534
People can walk a 10-minute walk from a few streets over during a blizzard, in theory, and park in front of our street or one of these other streets, and that's what we're all concerned about.

782
01:06:07,615 --> 01:06:09,577
Like, we all have our assigned parking today.

783
01:06:09,857 --> 01:06:12,419
And again, it works the best for ability.

784
01:06:12,939 --> 01:06:15,842
There are things that already exist, and we already have permit parking.

785
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:19,465
So that is what we are all globally stating to you.

786
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:27,391
And what affects all of our lives, whether it be people with needs, special needs, wheelchairs, etc.

787
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:30,493
Like, I'm just trying to advocate for my neighbors.

788
01:06:30,934 --> 01:06:35,518
I fortunately do have parking and for my own in my own driveway.

789
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:35,978
But

790
01:06:37,464 --> 01:06:45,206
I see what happens, and I see the dead-end aspect of Burgett, so then eliminate us from the circle and expand it to somewhere else.

791
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:50,867
Like, happy to have that occur, because we haven't figured it out, and it sounds like a couple other tight neighborhoods do too.

792
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:54,948
This isn't helping any of us.

793
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,668
We have the situation figured out.

794
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:06,750
Other than, I don't know, outsourcing and reducing costs for things, maybe that's what really the big picture is, but like, it's,

795
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:17,929
It's difficult to listen to you all say back to us some of these things when it's affecting people's daily lives when they want to come home and things and we experienced it.

796
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:29,633
I'm sorry, someone else is unmuted, but I just want to advocate for us all day and I. I hope that you're all listening to us and how it affects.

797
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:34,977
Each individual who lives in Medford in these areas and, like, I get it.

798
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:37,258
We don't live in other aspects of Medford.

799
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:38,278
So it's not impacting them.

800
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,680
And maybe they filled out the survey, which, by the way, none of my neighbors receive.

801
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:45,423
So, we weren't part of that survey that data was produced on.

802
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:47,324
That's super frustrating.

803
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:48,825
I don't know.

804
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,926
I just want to put a plea that, like, you'll please listen to us.

805
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:55,936
Thank you.

806
01:07:56,516 --> 01:08:03,559
Can we put a date on like six months from X date when this passes that we're gonna reevaluate and get input?

807
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:15,885
Because yeah, I absolutely am worried that this is just gonna get passed like many other things have happened that my neighbors have advocated for that we just, we vote and then a group of votes above us.

808
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:17,065
It's really frustrating.

809
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:20,967
There is as,

810
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:28,236
Jim and Todd and Commissioner McKibben has explained that this is a pilot program.

811
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:45,859
So as stated before, this program that if it is to pass, that it can be revisited in any aspect that may occur, whether that's other things that are going well or other things that may not be.

812
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:50,020
So there is a program in place for that.

813
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:54,765
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot that the neighbors of the dead end street are dealing with.

814
01:08:57,185 --> 01:09:00,606
Those people already don't have, they don't care where they're assigned spots.

815
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:01,986
They're already parking there.

816
01:09:02,326 --> 01:09:06,047
They're not going to change because now they can park on whatever that one street over is.

817
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:07,107
That's not going to get better.

818
01:09:09,668 --> 01:09:11,228
Give us some help here.

819
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:16,189
December 31st, we're going to reevaluate the program and we get a say.

820
01:09:16,649 --> 01:09:16,989
I don't know.

821
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:19,930
This sounds like a blanketed,

822
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:24,725
Let's see, I have not found that successful as a person.

823
01:09:24,805 --> 01:09:31,028
I just brought up the slides and we indicated that it would be re-evaluated in July 2025, one year later.

824
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:34,450
Okay, well, that's a long time, like one year.

825
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:41,213
It's a long time to live, like, we have something working in our areas.

826
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:42,174
Why?

827
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:46,156
I get that it's reducing costs for your team,

828
01:09:48,608 --> 01:09:51,687
But how much does a parking sticker really cost in the grand scheme?

829
01:09:53,913 --> 01:10:17,679
I think Jim might be able to better speak to this, that it's not so much when we talk about efficiencies, it's not so much the cost of things like stickers, it's when they are going out and patrolling for the tickets, they can move much faster and they can cover a broader area more quickly using the zoned approach than they can when it's street by street.

830
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:20,099
And I don't fully understand the technology.

831
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:22,740
I know Jim's worked with the technology some,

832
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,821
But that was my understanding from our parking division.

833
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:28,821
That's correct, Alicia.

834
01:10:29,561 --> 01:10:40,304
It will now be popping up on as we drive down the street and scan license plate, it pops up and says G zone or GL zone versus street by street.

835
01:10:40,944 --> 01:10:47,105
So again, if if a person in your street could not find parking and was parked on Hume,

836
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:52,748
It would pop up, person would have to get out, sign, do a ticket, etc.

837
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:54,749
So the efficiency is a little bit better.

838
01:10:54,789 --> 01:11:03,193
It allows more of a patrolling aspect and things are done with the resources we have more efficiently.

839
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:21,627
To your point of Burgett Ave, I was the co-chair of parking policy and enforcement, which this is part of the recommendations that were presented to the city on behalf of 1,000 residents, and my co-chair lived on Burgett Avenue, Laura Ruma, so I just want to mention that.

840
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:25,749
Hey, Todd, can I ask you a question?

841
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:27,670
No.

842
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:31,672
All right, because this is a pilot, maybe we could...

843
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:50,495
Ease some concerns with talking through a hypothetical of what a potential solution could be to a unanticipated concentration of vehicles within zone G concentrating on a street like Burgett or St.

844
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:51,436
Clements or

845
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,257
Braymore or one of these roads.

846
01:11:55,338 --> 01:12:06,626
Correct me if I'm wrong, but couldn't large zones be broken down into smaller zones to address an issue such as that while maintaining the integrity of the zoned system?

847
01:12:09,268 --> 01:12:17,654
I believe the current proposal was already broken down smaller from what the original consultant proposals were back in 15-16.

848
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:26,112
So usually, so at that time it might have recommended two to four zones in the entirety of South Medford Hillside.

849
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:34,954
And this is essentially less, smaller, this zone is smaller and within closer walking distance than any of those would have been.

850
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:43,816
So, but that's a good, and it's good to, as you mentioned, like talk through with people what could happen in a year.

851
01:12:43,896 --> 01:12:46,076
If for some reason it wasn't working, it was broken,

852
01:12:46,616 --> 01:12:47,717
and it was going to switch back.

853
01:12:48,217 --> 01:13:03,228
One of the reasons for going forward with the decal approach to the sign is that if it didn't work, we could easily switch the sign back with the decal over the decal to reuse the same materials and not buy new poles and signs and things like that.

854
01:13:03,868 --> 01:13:10,973
So there's some, you know, we're trying to be smart about things like that to not waste city's resources in terms of buying signs and then may not.

855
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:13,334
They may only be used for a year.

856
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:21,520
It's like we buy a decal, so it's a way to get the program signed without a huge cost.

857
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,002
So we're actually trying to save costs.

858
01:13:24,142 --> 01:13:31,627
For things like that, we're cognizant of that, but we're cognizant of the ability to implement it or take it away if that ever came to fruition next year.

859
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:35,669
Is that the only option though?

860
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,772
Would we be able to change something about the program to address

861
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:41,255
Unanticipated concentration.

862
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:44,758
I mean, I think anything's on the table.

863
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,081
You know, anything could be revaluing to get proposed.

864
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:52,626
But again, what we're trying to do here is look more as a neighborhood.

865
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:54,728
And look out for, so we've only.

866
01:13:55,308 --> 01:14:01,470
In my opinion, we've only primarily heard from streets that are more concerned because they're closest to the Green Line.

867
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:11,294
We haven't heard from people that are in the zone that are midway or at the peripheral of the zone or on a street that doesn't have on-street parking.

868
01:14:11,774 --> 01:14:17,075
So if you're a Winthrop Street, you have no on-street parking whatsoever, where do you park?

869
01:14:17,296 --> 01:14:22,637
If you're on College Ave where there's no parking allowed in that certain block near Stanley and Stearns, where do you park?

870
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:24,238
They come to this commission,

871
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:33,694
You know, they take time away from this commission that could be spent on other things to get a variance each year to park on Stearns and Stanley anyways.

872
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:39,335
So there's this concern that there's more people will be parking on, say, Stearns and Stanley than currently are.

873
01:14:40,056 --> 01:14:43,136
If they're there, they're already parking on Stearns and Stanley with a variance.

874
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:44,377
I apologize, folks.

875
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:47,017
So it's just eliminating some bureaucracy, right?

876
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:51,618
It's not adding, like Tim mentioned earlier, it's not new people.

877
01:14:51,938 --> 01:14:54,639
The people that exist that have permits already exist in your zone.

878
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,560
So some of them may have variances because their street does not have.

879
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,001
So Burgett and St.

880
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:04,162
Clemens and these other streets have the luxury of having on-street parking on both sides of the street.

881
01:15:04,742 --> 01:15:08,563
Some streets have no parking on either side or parking only on one side.

882
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:18,086
So do you think it's fair to those streets or those residents to not have any options or to have to go through this extra bureaucracy to use the same resident permit program?

883
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:24,350
Again, Medford's not blazing new trails here.

884
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:32,894
These are systems that have done in other localities in the region and they've been in place for decades, not just a year.

885
01:15:32,914 --> 01:15:35,036
Thank you.

886
01:15:39,378 --> 01:15:41,879
We have Nadine.

887
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,840
I think you have your hand up.

888
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,462
I don't know if it's from previous.

889
01:15:46,982 --> 01:15:48,103
You have a comment.

890
01:15:49,575 --> 01:15:51,797
Yes, no, this is the second time speaking.

891
01:15:51,857 --> 01:15:53,758
Thank you very much.

892
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:55,479
This is for Todd.

893
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:10,350
I want to try and understand what you were saying a little bit ago, that if I can't park in front of my home after coming home from work, that it's acceptable for me to have to park on Sunset and or Hume.

894
01:16:11,611 --> 01:16:18,276
I wanted to make sure that's what I was understanding you correctly when you said that.

895
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:20,665
Was that right?

896
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:25,238
Yeah, I just wanted to bring up Ariel to properly explain it.

897
01:16:25,298 --> 01:16:29,260
So I'm just trying to point out the opposite, like it could be beneficial.

898
01:16:29,681 --> 01:16:37,505
So say for instance, even in the existing circumstances, you live at 126 Burgett right here, right on the dead end portion.

899
01:16:38,105 --> 01:16:41,107
And all this is full and all this is full, all the spaces here.

900
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:46,930
Right now in the current system, you have to walk up Burgett around the corner, maybe it's still full here.

901
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:50,673
Maybe you have to go all the way up to number 55 to find a spot yourself.

902
01:16:51,576 --> 01:16:55,224
Now, instead of going up to number 55 or beyond green leaf,

903
01:16:55,950 --> 01:17:01,814
you could potentially walk around the corner onto Hume and there might be a spot in front of number 85 Hume and you could park there.

904
01:17:02,095 --> 01:17:08,019
That would be shorter for you than parking on Burgett way up near Chester, for instance.

905
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:11,902
So, you know, this is the glass half full glass of empty thing.

906
01:17:12,322 --> 01:17:22,970
You know, you're looking at all the potential negative of people coming to you, but not the potential positive of, oh, I could find a space for myself closer to my house than I might normally be able to find.

907
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,252
So it's just pointing out that it could go both ways, you know.

908
01:17:26,993 --> 01:17:28,234
Yeah, let me interject.

909
01:17:28,254 --> 01:17:31,596
There's nothing positive about that scenario you just presented.

910
01:17:32,076 --> 01:17:40,022
So someone like it's a very unrealistic ask for anyone to ask someone who owns their home and coming home from a long day of work.

911
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:47,342
to go up the street around the corner, park for the night, to then walk back to my house.

912
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:49,864
So for instance, someone like me, I have very bad knees.

913
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:54,529
I am not willing to do that, nor should I be asked to do that.

914
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:55,610
I don't know why.

915
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,893
And for the girl that spoke earlier,

916
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:02,017
Maybe I misspoke because I just want to clarify something.

917
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:04,779
We're not suggesting that you should have to do that.

918
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:14,285
I'm saying in the scenario that all the spaces near your house were full, in the current system, you have to walk further away from your house to find a spot.

919
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:17,928
That's when I'm saying you could find a closer spot in a different street.

920
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:19,208
That's the only thing I'm suggesting.

921
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,910
I'm not suggesting that you should have to do that.

922
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,653
I'm saying if it were full, like a lot of you say it is full a lot of times on the dead end,

923
01:18:26,193 --> 01:18:29,914
Instead of walking only up Burgett, you could walk up Burgett or Hume.

924
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:31,115
It's your choice.

925
01:18:31,255 --> 01:18:32,915
It's to your benefit, whatever is closer.

926
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:37,137
It's not to suggest that you should walk further.

927
01:18:37,157 --> 01:18:41,518
I think there's some sort of miscommunication happening here.

928
01:18:42,038 --> 01:18:43,779
No, there's definitely no miscommunication.

929
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:53,082
I know exactly what you're saying, but it's ludicrous to think that anybody would be happy or willing to even do that.

930
01:18:54,802 --> 01:18:56,183
Like I said, we've been fighting

931
01:18:57,303 --> 01:19:06,746
students parking here, hence the reason why at least the dead-end part of Burgett got the parking permits to help alleviate that problem, because this was a free-for-all.

932
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:07,947
It still is.

933
01:19:09,427 --> 01:19:22,212
But again, if this pilot program goes through, which I agree with everybody else saying, I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel here where we're concerned or our concerns are going to even be

934
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:35,358
I don't think that anybody on here would want to come home, including the people that are running this, and have to do that.

935
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:36,939
It doesn't sweeten the pot.

936
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,241
It doesn't make this any better.

937
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:41,924
It's just a maddening

938
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,968
theory to think that anybody would be willing to do that.

939
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:53,871
And if we come home to streets full of cars that, even if they're Medford residents, that doesn't matter to me.

940
01:19:54,531 --> 01:20:05,414
If they live on the whole other side of Medford but now can park over here because of this program, it's still taking away our own ability to park in front of our homes, come home.

941
01:20:07,582 --> 01:20:12,164
I know where I live, I know the options available to me, and that's unrealistic.

942
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:12,924
It just makes no sense.

943
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:14,564
Let's try this one more time.

944
01:20:14,884 --> 01:20:17,525
Hopefully the commission members who are going to vote will understand this.

945
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:31,630
So if you live at 71 Hume right now, and for whatever reason, it's on the screen, the spaces in this end of Hume near Sunset and Burgett are full, for whatever reason, if existing, if that's the case,

946
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:39,447
the current system you'd have to walk up Hume and maybe you might find the space way up here at number 13 Hume which is

947
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:43,407
650 feet away.

948
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:51,569
But with this proposal, that house number 71 could potentially find a spot next to 5 Sunset, which is 127 feet away.

949
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:54,030
That would be better for that person.

950
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:57,390
So again, that's just one example.

951
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:03,972
But it's not always the glass half full negative side of things, I guess, is what we're trying to explain.

952
01:21:07,957 --> 01:21:09,357
Thank you.

953
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:09,737
Part of it.

954
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:15,639
Ma'am, it sounds like you don't currently have trouble parking in front of your house, is that correct?

955
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:19,700
And you're concerned under the new system you would have trouble finding parking.

956
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:23,181
Sorry, you're muted.

957
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:26,602
I'm sorry, I was muted and then unmuted.

958
01:21:26,642 --> 01:21:27,482
Are you talking to me?

959
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:32,123
Yeah, it sounds like right now you don't have trouble finding parking in front of your house, is that correct?

960
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,670
Not all the time, but sometimes.

961
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:43,292
This would exacerbate that potential issue, and it's a huge ask.

962
01:21:43,572 --> 01:21:53,094
I mean, I would speak for the whole area, because I don't think anybody on this, except for the people proposing this, are for this pilot program.

963
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:59,356
But I don't know anyone that would be okay with this proposal.

964
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,215
walking 120 feet, 600 feet.

965
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:06,496
Yeah, it's a big ask.

966
01:22:06,536 --> 01:22:10,917
I mean, ask yourself, would you be okay with this in front of your own homes, wherever you live?

967
01:22:11,357 --> 01:22:12,577
And I don't think you will be.

968
01:22:12,657 --> 01:22:14,698
That's not what we're saying.

969
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:18,499
We're saying like under the existing system, you are restricted to parking on

970
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:23,982
So you may have to park very far away under the existing system if you can't find a spot.

971
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:32,608
Under the new system that we're proposing, you may be able to park a lot closer to your house because it's zoned parking versus street parking.

972
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:35,970
I think the fear that they have.

973
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:37,451
I don't think you're understanding.

974
01:22:37,571 --> 01:22:41,614
We need to have one person speak at a time.

975
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:42,675
We're going to answer this.

976
01:22:43,515 --> 01:22:59,502
I think the fear that folks have, Tim, is that, for instance, people that live on Chester Street, which is two to three blocks away, will all of a sudden, all the people on Chester Street will all park at the dead end of Berger, and then they'll have no parking available on the dead end of Berger.

977
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,262
That's the fear.

978
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:02,623
But it's only two blocks away.

979
01:23:03,003 --> 01:23:10,807
We picked a zone that's within short distance from each other to not capture all of South Middlebury Hillside, to reduce that.

980
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:13,548
potential, right?

981
01:23:14,108 --> 01:23:18,209
So, that's what, you know, the streets that we're hearing from are Burgett, St.

982
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:28,291
Clemens, the streets that are closest to the edge, the Braymore, and the fear is that someone from Pearl Street is going to drive and park on St.

983
01:23:28,311 --> 01:23:30,832
Clemens Road, you know, and it's, yeah.

984
01:23:31,892 --> 01:23:32,172
I get it.

985
01:23:32,192 --> 01:23:38,054
I'm just trying to understand the fear because despite what folks are saying, we do want to understand concerns, so.

986
01:23:41,943 --> 01:24:01,090
And just kind of reiterate the reason we're having this amongst meetings or this is to have everybody understand this is a pilot program as Todd and Jim, everyone has explained that this is, you guys do live in this area and this is a pilot program.

987
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:05,572
So we're all trying to get on, you know, the same understanding as everybody else here.

988
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:08,833
So can understand that, that'd be great.

989
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:10,565
keep moving forward.

990
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:14,026
I have Lynn with her, or his hand up.

991
01:24:17,027 --> 01:24:21,329
We just ask you to unmute, and then you can just state your name and address for us.

992
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:25,250
Hi, my name is Lynn Freitas.

993
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,050
I live at 26 Jern-Sam.

994
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:38,617
We had trouble with college students parking on our street and we had to get the whole street on board to get permit parking.

995
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:49,622
I don't understand why this commission didn't have to go to every single person in this zone area to see how they felt.

996
01:24:50,582 --> 01:24:53,685
about this zone parking.

997
01:24:54,485 --> 01:24:59,289
You can clearly see most of the residents are not in favor of this.

998
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:06,855
And one year for a pilot program is a long time if you're living in the area.

999
01:25:07,796 --> 01:25:10,759
My brother, you keep mentioning other cities.

1000
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,900
My brother lives in Cambridge.

1001
01:25:13,894 --> 01:25:17,136
He can barely park on his street.

1002
01:25:17,897 --> 01:25:27,424
And when he does park there, he'll leave the car there, and then he gets a ticket for not moving it within 48 hours.

1003
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:33,768
So you keep mentioning Somerville and Cambridge, how they have this.

1004
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:37,651
Permit parking has been working.

1005
01:25:39,932 --> 01:25:42,094
Every street has a different

1006
01:25:44,225 --> 01:25:45,606
They're not all the same.

1007
01:25:46,387 --> 01:25:51,790
So to throw this zone parking at all of us is not fair.

1008
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:58,975
Walking with a bag of groceries from three streets over, that's not fair.

1009
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:03,839
No stickers on windshields to know who is who.

1010
01:26:04,599 --> 01:26:08,142
Every town has a sticker, not Medford.

1011
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:26,741
It seems like the commissioners are trying to make it easier for themselves or the parking people, but it's not going to make it easy for the residents.

1012
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:35,868
We've had to deal with a lot with tough students being so close to us, and a lot of things have been thrown at us.

1013
01:26:38,975 --> 01:26:45,423
you know, I hope you really see that the residents don't want this and don't vote for it.

1014
01:26:46,364 --> 01:26:46,905
Thank you.

1015
01:26:48,147 --> 01:26:49,128
Thank you as well.

1016
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:57,819
And, uh, Nadine, it seems like you were cut off, so we will come back to you, uh, as you're on mute.

1017
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,504
Nadine, if you're still there, I think you posted in there you weren't done speaking.

1018
01:27:11,704 --> 01:27:12,085
Yes.

1019
01:27:12,465 --> 01:27:14,628
So thank you for allowing me to continue.

1020
01:27:15,409 --> 01:27:20,674
The questions I was asking, you know, to Todd, I wanted to go back and forth a little bit.

1021
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:23,277
And what I just want to say is this.

1022
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:27,422
I understand what you guys are saying and trying to explain to us, but

1023
01:27:28,104 --> 01:27:37,866
Again, to reiterate what the woman just said in the previous people that that is no consolation to us what you're suggesting.

1024
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:53,310
So you really, I implore you to really rethink this or rezone or do something different because it is doing nothing positive for this area, even if in your minds you think it is.

1025
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:53,750
So that's,

1026
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,011
what I would like to just end with.

1027
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:59,752
And thank you for unmuting me so I could continue.

1028
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:01,452
Okay, thank you very much.

1029
01:28:01,572 --> 01:28:05,813
Sure, and just briefly, thank you Nadine, I really appreciate it too.

1030
01:28:06,194 --> 01:28:12,956
It's okay to have professional conversation like this and hear different opinions, it's great.

1031
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:22,579
So what I'm trying to do as a city staff member is to speak for those who may not have spoken like for, again, someone on Winthrop Street, College Ave,

1032
01:28:23,419 --> 01:28:28,625
other streets that may not have any parking at all on that street or parking only on one side, they have limited options.

1033
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:33,831
They currently have to go through a very cumbersome process to get variances and things like that.

1034
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:39,697
And if and when they do get a variance and they're approved, they're already on the streets that you're concerned about.

1035
01:28:39,737 --> 01:28:44,843
So like, for instance, Stearns Ave, if they're worried about people from College Ave parking on the street,

1036
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:52,466
there already are people that apply for variances to get variances to park on one of those streets on either Stern, Stanley, or Pearl already.

1037
01:28:53,046 --> 01:28:57,568
They're not new people, they're people, it's just a less of a bureaucracy process, that's all.

1038
01:28:58,229 --> 01:29:03,931
Think of your neighbor that lives on that street, that's what I'm trying to speak for those folks because they're not here apparently.

1039
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:09,733
People that have more troubles because they just happen to live on a street that doesn't have parking.

1040
01:29:11,354 --> 01:29:13,515
Just trying to bring that perspective to the commission members.

1041
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:21,959
Thank you.

1042
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,403
We just have a couple more hands.

1043
01:29:24,186 --> 01:29:26,572
Obviously commissioners, if you want to chime in, please.

1044
01:29:29,175 --> 01:29:32,456
One quick note about enforcement in relation to the other neighboring communities.

1045
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:51,060
It's a little unfair comparison just because the difference in resources is substantial so that to expect the same level from one community to another that might have a much bigger budget and much more staff is not necessarily apples to apples.

1046
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:56,753
You notice, I believe you have your hand up.

1047
01:29:56,773 --> 01:30:02,330
I don't know if it's from prior, but I'll just ask you to unmute if you've already spoken and just go from there.

1048
01:30:06,688 --> 01:30:07,429
Thanks very much.

1049
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:09,030
Eunice Brown Greenleaf.

1050
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:13,373
A few different things here that I'm thinking about.

1051
01:30:13,393 --> 01:30:18,596
Todd mentions those who live on Winthrop Street or College Ave or whatever.

1052
01:30:18,616 --> 01:30:33,086
I mean, I'm of the mind that if you buy or rent a house on a main drag like that, then you know just by looking at it when you're inquiring that there's no parking there.

1053
01:30:33,746 --> 01:30:35,708
If you wanted

1054
01:30:37,072 --> 01:30:47,914
you know, parking, then you should be buying or renting a place that has parking on a side street or something and not on a main drag.

1055
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:57,236
Why should that be the problem of the people who own homes in places where there is available on street parking?

1056
01:30:57,696 --> 01:30:58,856
So that would be number one.

1057
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:04,477
You know, regarding the, like the Burgett area,

1058
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:10,718
If the people who live on the Burgett area on that.

1059
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:29,845
area down there at the end of the dead end, if the people who own homes there, and there's probably about a half a dozen or so homes on either side, if they're the ones that are parking there, and they've been parking there all those years, then it's not likely that they're filling up the street.

1060
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:39,673
It's the Tufts students that are coming and parking at will that are filling it up and causing a problem.

1061
01:31:41,354 --> 01:31:43,897
And if you're opening this up, then to.

1062
01:31:44,778 --> 01:31:53,128
Sunset and human green leaf and wherever else that's what's going to cause them the problems if it's just the houses.

1063
01:31:53,928 --> 01:31:57,192
That are in that area, then.

1064
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:02,154
That should be what's allowed in that area.

1065
01:32:02,455 --> 01:32:15,209
And if it's just those people packing, then there's not likely to be a problem unless somebody has a rock and wild party or something and invites 40 of their nearest and dearest friends.

1066
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:22,754
So if you're just limiting the parking to the people that live in that area, there isn't likely to be a problem.

1067
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:24,214
At least that's how I see it.

1068
01:32:24,314 --> 01:32:27,696
And the residents can correct me if I'm wrong.

1069
01:32:28,216 --> 01:32:33,479
You've had several people on here tonight who have spoken strongly against this.

1070
01:32:36,165 --> 01:32:38,226
I can't figure out who you're trying to cater to.

1071
01:32:38,507 --> 01:32:41,809
It's certainly not the people that live on the streets.

1072
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:53,457
And you've made it pretty clear and you've pushed back on every single point that the resident speakers have brought up that you're going to do this and

1073
01:32:54,345 --> 01:33:01,009
That's that that's crystal clear and like others, I don't believe that this is just a pilot.

1074
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,231
We're going to come back here in 6 months or a year.

1075
01:33:05,132 --> 01:33:10,755
And in all likelihood, push back even more strongly and yet.

1076
01:33:12,466 --> 01:33:17,587
It's going to continue on and to bring up a point that people had with the snow.

1077
01:33:17,607 --> 01:33:22,528
We got a decent sized storm and people are.

1078
01:33:23,249 --> 01:33:30,130
Shoveling mountains of snow into various areas of the street, because there's no place else to put it.

1079
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:32,011
Mind you, we've all.

1080
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:37,332
Put all of the snow that we can in our front gardens or side yards or whatever.

1081
01:33:38,605 --> 01:33:43,688
The amount of parking on these streets shrinks considerably.

1082
01:33:44,508 --> 01:33:48,330
And so that's going to cause an even bigger problem.

1083
01:33:49,451 --> 01:33:49,791
I just.

1084
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:55,594
I, I can't see how this is a good idea at all.

1085
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:59,957
And without the stickers, there's no way for us to know.

1086
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:03,963
who's belonging here and not.

1087
01:34:04,743 --> 01:34:06,884
And we need two things.

1088
01:34:07,265 --> 01:34:10,246
We need the stickers and we need the enforcement.

1089
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:23,454
And nobody's asking the Medford police who do an awesome job protecting us to take time out of their shifts when there are more important things going on.

1090
01:34:23,474 --> 01:34:27,797
I think we need to take a closer look at the actual parking department.

1091
01:34:28,657 --> 01:34:32,818
and figure out what's going on there with or without stickers.

1092
01:34:32,838 --> 01:34:38,539
I mean, we don't have the stickers now, so they're not coming around to enforce.

1093
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:48,481
At least with the stickers, we'd have the ability, the residents to be proactive and make a call and then see where that goes.

1094
01:34:49,762 --> 01:34:53,723
But I can't see that they're certainly not patrolling around here.

1095
01:34:54,243 --> 01:34:54,803
So again,

1096
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:59,226
You know, this is not the right thing for this area.

1097
01:34:59,826 --> 01:35:00,407
Thank you.

1098
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:06,251
Thank you for your time and we just have 1 more hand up.

1099
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,272
Jenny Lynn, if you'd like to speak again.

1100
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:10,454
You're going to end up efforts from prior.

1101
01:35:19,596 --> 01:35:21,157
Hi, my name is Jaylin Pagan.

1102
01:35:22,137 --> 01:35:23,778
I live at 459 Broadway.

1103
01:35:23,798 --> 01:35:25,899
This is my second time speaking.

1104
01:35:26,139 --> 01:35:36,403
I just also want to reiterate a lot of what people said about the parking department is not very enforceable.

1105
01:35:37,203 --> 01:35:45,927
Also, a lot of the exemptions on Strathmore, Braymore and Killside, those corner lots are not allowed visitor passes.

1106
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:57,875
So anytime we want to have people over, we either have to move our cars or we need to have it on a Sunday where there is no enforcement.

1107
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:05,882
Also, I'm just curious of why this is being proposed in South Medford.

1108
01:36:05,962 --> 01:36:08,185
Like, is it just because of the green line?

1109
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:13,862
In the train station, because what's never has a commuter rail.

1110
01:36:14,022 --> 01:36:17,288
So, was this ever proposed in West Medford.

1111
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:19,051
So that's a good question.

1112
01:36:19,111 --> 01:36:23,974
I think we answered that at the public information meeting, but you know, for those who didn't attend that, we can answer that here.

1113
01:36:24,454 --> 01:36:27,936
It's not, you know, for any nefarious reason to pick on South Medford.

1114
01:36:28,276 --> 01:36:32,719
South Medford just happens to be the most densely populated area of Medford, right?

1115
01:36:32,979 --> 01:36:34,320
It's along the Somerville border.

1116
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,481
We get the spillover.

1117
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:37,482
It's the most densely populated area.

1118
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:42,245
So that's the most, typically the most parking issues when it's more dense neighborhood.

1119
01:36:42,765 --> 01:36:44,827
So when we compare it to North or West, those are,

1120
01:36:45,627 --> 01:37:06,847
more sparsely densely populated areas right so they don't necessarily have the same parking issues so that the southern end of Medford is more city-like for lack of a better term and northern parts are more suburban in the sense that they may not have to deal with the same issues that all of you are bringing up as issues for you when you park so so that's that's why and then the green line coming in

1121
01:37:07,693 --> 01:37:09,394
could have potentially exacerbated that.

1122
01:37:09,454 --> 01:37:17,897
But again, the permanent parking system is a system that we have to prevent others from other communities from coming here to park for those purposes.

1123
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:23,539
And those green line stations were explicitly built without parking garages to not become another airway.

1124
01:37:24,099 --> 01:37:26,920
So, that's why it's ultimate for it.

1125
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:32,962
It's the most densely populated portion with the most parking type issues in the city.

1126
01:37:37,615 --> 01:37:53,570
right but the problem i'm having is like there's a house across the street from me and they pretty much rent beds by the handfuls and they reuse their visitor passes and i i'm pretty sure

1127
01:37:54,190 --> 01:38:01,014
Of the 12 people that live there, only 2 of them have perma parking because they reuse their visitor passes.

1128
01:38:01,534 --> 01:38:09,259
And then we have their girlfriends and boyfriends and whoever else wants to come visit them parking there, even though they have a driveway.

1129
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:14,402
Multiple cars, those are good points, but those are existing.

1130
01:38:15,082 --> 01:38:16,423
Enforcement type things and.

1131
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:18,906
this proposal is independent.

1132
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:24,313
But it's also bringing up the parking issues that are happening already.

1133
01:38:26,155 --> 01:38:30,261
I think we mentioned earlier in the meeting and we'll reiterate

1134
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:36,900
You know, we obviously feel like enforcement's important as well, and we think they do a good job with the resources they have.

1135
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:47,144
The intent is to grow the parking department over time so that we could have more and more enforcement to rise to the level of the expectations of the community.

1136
01:38:47,973 --> 01:38:54,660
And in comparison to other neighboring cities, we don't have nearly the same amount of staff doing that.

1137
01:38:54,960 --> 01:39:02,428
So that's one of the intents over time to grow that to help with all of these enforcement type related questions and comments.

1138
01:39:02,969 --> 01:39:05,551
But we're trying to keep that independent of this process because

1139
01:39:06,192 --> 01:39:16,642
If there's a lack of, you know, or perceived or real lack of enforcement due to resources before or after this proposal, that's not, you know, going to change.

1140
01:39:16,682 --> 01:39:21,426
If this didn't get approved, you're still going to have those issues, right, regardless if it gets approved or not.

1141
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:26,811
So we're trying to keep that separate, but it's been heard loud and clear at the public information meeting and this meeting as well.

1142
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:34,192
So we that work for the city, I hope I can speak for others, we work here to help.

1143
01:39:34,252 --> 01:39:35,352
We're trying to improve things.

1144
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:37,593
We're not trying to make things more difficult for people.

1145
01:39:38,313 --> 01:39:49,717
And we're some of the people that are helping and we're at times we could use more as well, but we're all doing the best we can and the parking staff does the best they can as well.

1146
01:39:54,042 --> 01:40:01,165
I'm very grateful for the parking department and the police department, obviously.

1147
01:40:01,785 --> 01:40:16,632
But what I'm saying is adding on to this pilot program, you're going to add on more issues into the parking issues that are happening in South Medford is what I'm trying to say and a lot of other people are trying to say.

1148
01:40:21,847 --> 01:40:22,248
Thank you.

1149
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:23,392
Thank you.

1150
01:40:23,794 --> 01:40:26,001
And then looks like we have one more hand.

1151
01:40:28,265 --> 01:40:31,107
Our Estella again here, just ask you to unmute.

1152
01:40:31,588 --> 01:40:32,809
Yes, unmute.

1153
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:40,415
And this is the second time that I speak exactly what the previous speaker said.

1154
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:49,462
If you were truly interested in solving some of the problems of South Medford, you would solve the existing problems.

1155
01:40:49,562 --> 01:40:55,087
What you're doing is sugarcoating a program that will become

1156
01:40:55,627 --> 01:41:01,851
enforced in law for the rest of us in a year and we will not have any say.

1157
01:41:02,252 --> 01:41:06,054
We don't have any say now, we will not have any say in the future.

1158
01:41:06,735 --> 01:41:24,567
It sounds like everything is already set in a trajectory and we are made, I don't know if you want to call the program victim of the whole city, if the zone program was good for

1159
01:41:25,387 --> 01:41:34,274
was better than the existing street program, you would do it for the whole city, not just for South Medford.

1160
01:41:37,476 --> 01:41:37,897
Thank you.

1161
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:45,042
That looks to be the only hands I can see that are up for the public.

1162
01:41:45,883 --> 01:41:47,704
Pass it off to the commissioners.

1163
01:41:48,845 --> 01:41:49,886
Questions, comments?

1164
01:42:00,684 --> 01:42:01,545
Do we have a motion?

1165
01:42:01,725 --> 01:42:06,269
Seeing none, Jim and Todd, if there's any other comments you have.

1166
01:42:08,752 --> 01:42:09,913
I'm wondering if there's any benefit.

1167
01:42:09,933 --> 01:42:15,398
You know, one of the things that I'm hearing is 12 months might be a long time.

1168
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:20,904
Do we want to do an interim check-in period at like six months or something like that, if this were to pass?

1169
01:42:22,878 --> 01:42:25,641
I think that we may want to get data at six months.

1170
01:42:25,821 --> 01:42:42,961
The difficulty is that we're dealing with both a change to a system but change to people's behaviors and that it takes a while for people to adjust to having something new happening and how they adjust their behavior.

1171
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:43,842
So it's likely

1172
01:42:44,302 --> 01:42:48,405
that we wouldn't see much shifting of behaviors for the first few months.

1173
01:42:48,865 --> 01:42:57,831
Maybe the first week, but it takes a while for people to settle into a new normal and figure out their new places and stuff.

1174
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:05,896
While we certainly should get data, and I'd love to get, I think that Jim's already working on getting us more data about the current state.

1175
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:14,739
with the new systems that they're getting into the parking vehicles, because I'd love to see that, and that we can compare that.

1176
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:21,942
But I'm hesitant to say that we would make a decision after only six months, simply because that'll also be the middle of the winter.

1177
01:43:22,422 --> 01:43:27,903
If it's a winter like this winter, it was like a non-issue.

1178
01:43:28,043 --> 01:43:34,465
But if we ended up with a lot of snow, that could really just change behaviors really dramatically during that window of time.

1179
01:43:36,206 --> 01:43:39,947
I wouldn't want to say it's make or break in six months.

1180
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:43,929
I see Steve's raising his hand and I'm hoping he has enough connection.

1181
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:46,169
We couldn't hear him at the beginning of the meeting.

1182
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:47,210
Can you hear me?

1183
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:50,070
Can you hear me?

1184
01:43:50,651 --> 01:43:51,611
Yes, barely.

1185
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:53,592
Can you hear us?

1186
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:55,932
Can you hear me now?

1187
01:43:58,922 --> 01:43:59,522
It's worse.

1188
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:01,943
We're not, we're still not able to hear you.

1189
01:44:01,963 --> 01:44:07,044
I wonder, Steve, I wonder if he could call in separately from us.

1190
01:44:11,385 --> 01:44:18,988
Commissioner Rosensky, if you want to try, maybe call in just... I'm just going to mute him again, guys.

1191
01:44:19,568 --> 01:44:27,810
I'm not really... I'm going to send him a message, like the chat message, suggesting he tried dialing in on his phone.

1192
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:40,950
The problem is that it's delayed and so it's still trying to pass through his sound

1193
01:44:56,792 --> 01:45:04,136
And does somebody have, one of us has his cell number to text him the phone number?

1194
01:45:04,156 --> 01:45:04,216
Yep.

1195
01:45:07,277 --> 01:45:12,720
If we're waiting on that, does Commissioner Patti Velasca have any questions for us?

1196
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:16,441
Can I call in separately?

1197
01:45:19,303 --> 01:45:19,503
Yes.

1198
01:45:21,787 --> 01:45:28,990
If a new phone number shows up, we can just, actually, it sounds like you have his number, so you might recognize it as his.

1199
01:45:40,038 --> 01:46:01,841
question i have is that does the patent change at all when the tough students leave in may is there any break in between for the residents with the parking on the side streets and such if you're asking me and jim um yeah obviously there are waves in terms of traffic and parking different densities different

1200
01:46:02,894 --> 01:46:04,135
throughout different times of the year.

1201
01:46:04,535 --> 01:46:14,722
So like when Tufts, for instance, because they're a university straddling the city, when they leave, they have the finals late April, and then they have commencement in May, mid-May.

1202
01:46:15,223 --> 01:46:22,968
Usually from mid-May to September, overall in the city, there's less traffic because it's vacation schools, elementary school, high school, out in the summer.

1203
01:46:23,368 --> 01:46:25,130
So combined with the university gone,

1204
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:28,711
Parking and traffic overall is lower usually during those times.

1205
01:46:28,731 --> 01:46:29,711
So that's another reason.

1206
01:46:29,911 --> 01:46:46,077
I think kind of what Alicia was alluding to, like having a longer period of like kind of testing things out because there, you know, you may think things are different, but really September, the fall would be the time to kind of evaluate and then, you know, collect data through the spring, say.

1207
01:46:47,077 --> 01:46:49,138
But if that was your question, Patty, I don't know.

1208
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:54,140
Yes, thank you.

1209
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:59,643
I think Nadine has her hand up again.

1210
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:00,184
Commissioners.

1211
01:47:00,925 --> 01:47:04,728
Is the new cell phone that just joined, is that Steve's number?

1212
01:47:04,968 --> 01:47:06,270
Oh, yes, he just messaged me.

1213
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:07,090
That's Steve.

1214
01:47:07,431 --> 01:47:09,493
So maybe we could hear from the commissioner first.

1215
01:47:09,973 --> 01:47:10,754
Yep, great.

1216
01:47:13,696 --> 01:47:16,659
It's the new, the 0067 number.

1217
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,342
I don't know if you're able to make that a co-host.

1218
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,844
Yep, I'm scrolling down.

1219
01:47:26,692 --> 01:47:30,254
You say 0067, I'll make that.

1220
01:47:30,854 --> 01:47:34,557
It's the only actual, well, it's the other one says phone number.

1221
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:44,723
I don't think I'm able to make that a co-host, but I'll ask that number to unmute.

1222
01:47:44,983 --> 01:47:45,763
Unmute it, yeah.

1223
01:47:46,424 --> 01:47:51,727
And Steve, while you're there, you can use star nine to raise your hand at any point.

1224
01:47:53,168 --> 01:47:54,168
Can you hear me now?

1225
01:47:54,749 --> 01:47:54,949
Yes.

1226
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:00,147
modern technology at its best.

1227
01:48:03,248 --> 01:48:03,689
Can you hear me?

1228
01:48:03,729 --> 01:48:04,389
Can I speak now?

1229
01:48:04,589 --> 01:48:04,989
I'm sorry.

1230
01:48:05,009 --> 01:48:05,910
Yeah, we have you.

1231
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:07,310
We have you clear now.

1232
01:48:07,931 --> 01:48:09,091
Are you all on the floor, George?

1233
01:48:10,992 --> 01:48:19,897
You know, the only thing I'll add to this is like other projects, and I truly do appreciate Todd and Jim and all the work they do, but this thing needs work.

1234
01:48:20,257 --> 01:48:21,198
It still needs work.

1235
01:48:21,338 --> 01:48:25,960
And whereas we did open up the public comment, which I was not aware we,

1236
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:28,127
We had a public meeting about this.

1237
01:48:28,928 --> 01:48:34,953
If we're still using the phone system, I think this is further evidence that that just still doesn't work properly.

1238
01:48:36,534 --> 01:48:38,836
But I like the program.

1239
01:48:39,016 --> 01:48:40,557
I wish people would embrace it.

1240
01:48:41,318 --> 01:48:53,207
But I do think that we should take a little bit more time to let people talk a little bit more and see, because there are no positive people on the phone again.

1241
01:48:54,457 --> 01:48:55,738
just only the negative people.

1242
01:48:55,858 --> 01:49:00,022
And this is what happened the last time we implemented a program like this.

1243
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:15,254
And so I don't know what else to do, but giving people a further opportunity to provide some input, another avenue for them to provide input, I think is beneficial to everybody.

1244
01:49:16,948 --> 01:49:24,495
Because again, I do like the program, but I don't like that there are people with genuine concerns that don't feel heard.

1245
01:49:24,795 --> 01:49:25,976
So, and I'll stop there.

1246
01:49:28,718 --> 01:49:34,263
I mean, if I may with this, I'm gonna probably share some thoughts here on my professional experience.

1247
01:49:35,224 --> 01:49:37,987
I attend a lot of public meetings and it's very common

1248
01:49:38,992 --> 01:49:47,080
for the people opposed to something to, you know, come out and attend things more so than people that are for something.

1249
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:55,788
So, I mean, we can look back in this meeting, you know, whatever happens, the rest of this meeting, we can look back to see how many different comments there were.

1250
01:49:56,068 --> 01:49:57,209
I think it was less than 10.

1251
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:16,292
because several people spoke several times over and over and of those less than 10 it was only representative of say three or four streets not necessarily the 50 plus streets right so so just keep that in mind when we have public meetings like this and this isn't like a one-off this is like my experience throughout the 25-year career

1252
01:50:17,312 --> 01:50:18,753
This is typically what happens.

1253
01:50:18,974 --> 01:50:27,921
We went, we did more than typical trying to have a public information meeting about this one topic a month prior, and that was well attended.

1254
01:50:27,941 --> 01:50:29,362
It was about 50 people attended.

1255
01:50:29,822 --> 01:50:33,766
So, you know, which for a public meeting of this type of topic, that's pretty good attendance.

1256
01:50:34,546 --> 01:50:36,308
So, we have taken measures.

1257
01:50:36,368 --> 01:50:41,532
We did do the robocall, Steve, but we did hold a public meeting just for that sole topic.

1258
01:50:42,112 --> 01:50:43,473
to help answer questions.

1259
01:50:43,793 --> 01:50:49,956
And a lot of the same people that are attending this making a lot of the same comments, which again, is very valuable.

1260
01:50:50,456 --> 01:50:58,840
But as city staff and as a commission, I would say that that's not necessarily represented when, in my opinion, when people say the majority are against it.

1261
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:04,262
The majority of people spoke, which seems like less than 10 people or so.

1262
01:51:04,622 --> 01:51:09,584
And that's not to mean that their voices don't count for anything.

1263
01:51:09,604 --> 01:51:13,466
I'm just trying to put in perspective, is that truly a majority?

1264
01:51:14,066 --> 01:51:15,727
So just keep that in mind.

1265
01:51:16,247 --> 01:51:16,507
Thanks.

1266
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,971
As another commissioner, I feel like

1267
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:37,799
When we first started talking about doing the permit parking for all the streets, one of the comments that we heard was, why are we doing them street by street?

1268
01:51:37,919 --> 01:51:39,120
Why isn't it a zone?

1269
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:47,824
And there have been a lot of people who move in here and don't understand why it's street by street, and they end up getting tickets.

1270
01:51:49,025 --> 01:51:54,490
It has been a hassle for a lot of people and it is a very unusual situation.

1271
01:51:54,510 --> 01:52:12,586
It is clearly grown as Medford does organically, where there is an individual who doesn't like something, so they request to something to be changed, and then they get a group of people together to agree that they want that change, and then that location gets the change they asked for.

1272
01:52:13,006 --> 01:52:16,727
And that is how Medford has been conducting business for the past 35 years.

1273
01:52:17,668 --> 01:52:24,670
It's very, very responsive to the people who speak up and have agency and ask for change.

1274
01:52:25,191 --> 01:52:28,152
And then it's not responsive to everybody else.

1275
01:52:28,912 --> 01:52:30,733
I think that's part of my concern.

1276
01:52:30,793 --> 01:52:38,738
One of the reasons why I've really liked a zone parking is because people feel that they should have the ability to park in front of their own home.

1277
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:47,684
I lived for years in Somerville and Cambridge, and it's a dense area, and that's just not a choice.

1278
01:52:49,445 --> 01:52:56,950
I feel the worst for people who have lived here a long time and the neighborhood has changed around them.

1279
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:01,693
And that is just a very hard situation when you live somewhere.

1280
01:53:02,173 --> 01:53:13,400
And unfortunately, now we are in a car centric world and people expect to have cars and they expect to be able to drive and cars are cheaper and more and more people can afford them.

1281
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:17,683
And I'm frankly stunned by the number of college students who have vehicles.

1282
01:53:18,183 --> 01:53:29,273
and you have no idea the number of times I've had to say no in this crazed voice to my own two college students when they think that they should be allowed to have a car at college.

1283
01:53:29,734 --> 01:53:39,602
It's the most bizarre thing and it's the changing world around us and it's really hard for people to see their neighborhoods changing around them.

1284
01:53:40,575 --> 01:53:43,357
Unfortunately, this is a very dense area.

1285
01:53:44,218 --> 01:53:50,923
I do want to address the question about not applying it to the rest of Medford.

1286
01:53:50,983 --> 01:53:54,285
We did look at doing this in other parts of South Medford.

1287
01:53:54,666 --> 01:54:01,210
It has been discussed because they also have a lot of areas with resident permit parking.

1288
01:54:02,632 --> 01:54:08,376
There are other parts of Medford that aren't like this and are so spread out that they don't have permit parking.

1289
01:54:08,836 --> 01:54:14,337
And they don't need it because there's not issues from people coming and parking at their homes.

1290
01:54:14,777 --> 01:54:19,959
I mean, maybe if our commuter rail ran more frequently and more reliably, we'd have a problem in West Medford.

1291
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:25,780
They don't have problems this way, the same way in that area.

1292
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:32,842
But we do have a plan that could get implemented and we could continue to roll this out in the rest of the city for zones.

1293
01:54:33,302 --> 01:54:37,583
I would not, I strongly object to adding more street by street parking.

1294
01:54:38,203 --> 01:54:42,584
permit parking in the city of Medford, because it's not the way to run a city.

1295
01:54:43,805 --> 01:54:47,766
So it looks like the chief had to step away.

1296
01:54:47,786 --> 01:54:50,567
He did.

1297
01:54:50,747 --> 01:54:52,408
He should be back in a short period.

1298
01:54:54,148 --> 01:54:57,109
We know he had to go to city council for a bit tonight.

1299
01:54:57,809 --> 01:54:59,310
Yeah, he should be back.

1300
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:02,231
I'm not sure exactly when.

1301
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:05,552
He's advised me if the vote is to happen tonight.

1302
01:55:06,964 --> 01:55:10,267
We will vote for him as his designee.

1303
01:55:11,267 --> 01:55:14,910
It seems like we have no motion.

1304
01:55:16,271 --> 01:55:18,433
That's it, the motion is passed, but it seems like we have...

1305
01:55:20,933 --> 01:55:23,594
some hands still raised, so it seems like we'll get through to that.

1306
01:55:25,294 --> 01:55:30,155
I do want us to limit, at this point, hearing from people over and over again.

1307
01:55:30,175 --> 01:55:36,497
There is one person who's joined us late who hasn't spoken yet, who has his hands up.

1308
01:55:37,717 --> 01:55:44,939
I am very open to hearing from people, but there is a point that we're just hearing the same things over and over again.

1309
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:54,561
Let's go to Dave.

1310
01:55:54,701 --> 01:55:55,962
It seems like you just joined.

1311
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:02,266
I'll just ask you on mute and then just say your name and address.

1312
01:56:03,587 --> 01:56:09,091
Name is David Blackyear, 96 College Ave.

1313
01:56:09,111 --> 01:56:16,296
And I've been listening here and I've heard quite a few things that I don't agree with.

1314
01:56:16,816 --> 01:56:21,680
The first thing is the person who said that you buy a house on a main drag

1315
01:56:22,978 --> 01:56:25,320
and you can't expect parking.

1316
01:56:25,821 --> 01:56:27,042
I live on College Ave.

1317
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:30,425
My family has owned this house for 67 years.

1318
01:56:31,106 --> 01:56:38,213
There was parking on College Ave, but because of Tufts abusing that, it was taken away.

1319
01:56:39,174 --> 01:56:47,462
So you can't make that statement that you buy a house on a main drag and you can't expect parking.

1320
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:55,814
The main situation here that we have to deal with in South Medford, College Ave, Hillside is Tufts.

1321
01:56:56,515 --> 01:56:57,535
Let's just say it.

1322
01:56:59,437 --> 01:57:08,802
Tufts students are taking advantage of us because they do not wanna pay the enormous parking fee that Tufts wants to charge.

1323
01:57:09,383 --> 01:57:16,227
So they park wherever they can park and they'll take the tickets and they'll take the toll.

1324
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:19,359
That's just the way it is.

1325
01:57:19,659 --> 01:57:23,123
I mean, I'm right in the middle between Stearns and Stanley.

1326
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:24,884
I have no place to park.

1327
01:57:25,585 --> 01:57:35,995
I have guest permit that I can't, I can't use because now all of a sudden I'm getting tickets on the side streets on either side.

1328
01:57:37,497 --> 01:57:40,880
So I agree with the zone parking.

1329
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:49,194
I mean, but the first thing we need to do is address the students parking willy-nilly all over this area.

1330
01:57:49,875 --> 01:57:53,176
I mean, that's the gorilla in the room.

1331
01:57:54,116 --> 01:57:56,317
I don't know why everybody can't agree to that.

1332
01:57:57,137 --> 01:57:58,578
I see it every day.

1333
01:57:59,538 --> 01:58:04,320
They pull up, they park on Stanley Ave, they run in, they go do whatever they do.

1334
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,920
They're there for four or five hours.

1335
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,521
Meanwhile, the residents, you can't do anything.

1336
01:58:14,042 --> 01:58:16,464
I understand that there's more cars.

1337
01:58:17,784 --> 01:58:19,786
Everyone has three or four cars now.

1338
01:58:20,186 --> 01:58:25,770
I have a driveway, but if I have a guest, I don't know where they park.

1339
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:32,954
We used to be able to park at Tufts across the street, Elliott Pearson, no more.

1340
01:58:34,255 --> 01:58:39,519
Even though all night long that lot is empty, Tufts will not allow it.

1341
01:58:40,778 --> 01:58:42,718
For years and years, it was allowed.

1342
01:58:43,159 --> 01:58:47,640
We got a permit from Tufts to park in Elliott Pearson parking lot.

1343
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:51,140
Tufts is not the good neighbor that they used to be, believe me.

1344
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:52,581
Not at all.

1345
01:58:53,601 --> 01:58:54,581
They're disruptive.

1346
01:58:55,301 --> 01:59:01,323
They take advantage of things in the city that we allow to happen.

1347
01:59:01,483 --> 01:59:03,163
I don't know why, but we do.

1348
01:59:03,563 --> 01:59:04,784
We allow it to happen.

1349
01:59:07,761 --> 01:59:08,882
That's all I have to say.

1350
01:59:08,962 --> 01:59:32,425
I have a variance up here to try to get some kind of parking on one of the side streets here, the Stearns or Stanley, because I've got $600 worth of tickets last year that no one could seem to explain why I had a permit for College Ave that has no parking on it.

1351
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:40,009
They told me I could park on Stanley, which I did, but then they proceeded to give me a ticket every single day.

1352
01:59:42,171 --> 01:59:43,872
I got no relief from the city.

1353
01:59:43,892 --> 01:59:46,373
I went to the parking department.

1354
01:59:46,394 --> 01:59:48,575
It was like I was invisible.

1355
01:59:49,936 --> 01:59:58,782
I understand how hard this is for this area because of the number of cars.

1356
01:59:59,883 --> 02:00:03,885
in these little streets that we have, Birgit Av is a nightmare.

1357
02:00:04,245 --> 02:00:07,767
I drove down Birgit Av and I couldn't even turn around to get out of it.

1358
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:15,691
So we have to get rid of that first problem, tough students.

1359
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:19,833
Soon as they're parked, tow them, get rid of them.

1360
02:00:21,334 --> 02:00:24,716
No leniency, no 48 hours.

1361
02:00:25,116 --> 02:00:26,877
They know exactly what they're doing.

1362
02:00:29,928 --> 02:00:31,088
That's all I have to say.

1363
02:00:33,069 --> 02:00:35,009
I don't envy your positions here.

1364
02:00:35,349 --> 02:00:36,909
I do not envy it at all.

1365
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,070
Thank you.

1366
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:41,850
Appreciate that.

1367
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:45,511
And we'll get to your variance when it's on the board here.

1368
02:00:45,531 --> 02:00:49,351
So I appreciate it.

1369
02:00:49,371 --> 02:00:51,632
The two other hands have spoken.

1370
02:00:51,652 --> 02:00:54,752
You stated as commissioners, if you have anything else.

1371
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,281
The only other thing I have, Jordan, is two things.

1372
02:01:02,361 --> 02:01:04,741
I mean, A, we should probably try to move things along.

1373
02:01:04,881 --> 02:01:12,923
And B, I think we're listening to you folks that are opposed to this.

1374
02:01:13,523 --> 02:01:21,705
And I know, for one, I want to try to figure out a way to monitor those issues to see if they actually become reality.

1375
02:01:21,805 --> 02:01:23,805
And you folks are convinced they will become reality.

1376
02:01:24,605 --> 02:01:28,126
I want to know if they actually do become reality and then what we can do about it.

1377
02:01:29,547 --> 02:01:35,671
Because as Todd has stated, Jim has talked about the work that his group did.

1378
02:01:35,691 --> 02:01:42,535
This is the way to better manage the parking space in a city, the parking lanes in the city.

1379
02:01:44,477 --> 02:01:47,118
Anyway, I'd say we try to move things along.

1380
02:01:47,138 --> 02:01:50,100
I think we're hearing the same comments.

1381
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:56,465
If there's novel comments, we can hear them, but I think we get the gist of the commentary tonight.

1382
02:01:57,861 --> 02:02:02,043
Yeah, so the two hands that we have up, we'll go back to your questions.

1383
02:02:02,664 --> 02:02:07,927
If it is something that has already been brought up, we are going to move forward here.

1384
02:02:07,967 --> 02:02:18,333
We're going to- Jordan, I think Steve, a commission member, was trying to- he had his hand raised the last time- Yeah, he came through.

1385
02:02:18,373 --> 02:02:24,937
Steve, you should be unmuted if you want to- I did unmute his cell phone.

1386
02:02:25,737 --> 02:02:26,958
I can't make his cell phone a call.

1387
02:02:28,856 --> 02:02:31,158
I don't, you know, I don't have anything to say.

1388
02:02:31,818 --> 02:02:42,525
I like Tim's position of continuing to monitor this and providing citizens a chance to continue to actually provide input and not wait till 12 months are out before we look back on this.

1389
02:02:42,645 --> 02:02:56,814
And even to the point where I'd like to start looking at making a decision maybe at month 10 and let the 12-month program kind of go all the way through, I do agree 12 months is probably better because you get

1390
02:02:57,493 --> 02:03:01,896
a spring, you get a summer, you get a fall, and you get a winter in your data.

1391
02:03:03,176 --> 02:03:04,617
But that's all I had to add.

1392
02:03:04,817 --> 02:03:07,559
I think I put my hand down, but that's all I had to add.

1393
02:03:08,299 --> 02:03:08,759
Thank you.

1394
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:10,000
So we'll go to Nadine.

1395
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:15,223
Nadine, we're going to limit this to 30 seconds and just ask you to unmute.

1396
02:03:19,177 --> 02:03:19,937
Okay, thank you.

1397
02:03:19,977 --> 02:03:22,698
Yep, I know it's my third time speaking, but I just had a question.

1398
02:03:22,738 --> 02:03:29,779
I wanted a little clarification on what Alicia said about people changing behaviors or behaviors, something to that effect.

1399
02:03:29,839 --> 02:03:31,519
I'd like to understand more of that, please.

1400
02:03:32,039 --> 02:03:32,359
Thank you.

1401
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:48,522
So, for example, what I was talking about is that, you know, if there are many residents, like the gentleman who spoke, who live on crowded streets, and I suspect that there are residents right now who are

1402
02:03:48,642 --> 02:03:53,304
walking in this neighborhood two blocks from their car to where they live.

1403
02:03:54,024 --> 02:03:58,666
And some of them may start to say, geez, I don't have to walk two blocks anymore.

1404
02:03:59,186 --> 02:04:01,947
I can just go around the corner now and get parking.

1405
02:04:02,868 --> 02:04:07,890
And that those people will change their behaviors about where they park on a regular basis.

1406
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,130
And I think that it'll take a while.

1407
02:04:11,011 --> 02:04:15,892
Some people may not realize right away that they could do that or they have options like that.

1408
02:04:16,772 --> 02:04:20,332
So that's sort of what I was talking about is for people changing their behaviors.

1409
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:31,295
And I think that the behaviors that people are concerned we're going to see, people deciding, well, gee, I actually can now drive closer to a T station.

1410
02:04:32,755 --> 02:04:35,436
that those people might not do that right away.

1411
02:04:35,496 --> 02:04:36,676
They might not realize it.

1412
02:04:36,796 --> 02:04:47,320
And if that's going to be a problem of people in the middle of the district going to near the Green Line stations to park, it might take a few months before they start doing that.

1413
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:52,461
And we realize that it's actually a problem and not just a one-off thing.

1414
02:04:52,521 --> 02:04:56,082
And nobody minds if one person does it once every six months.

1415
02:04:56,462 --> 02:05:01,724
It's when the people are doing it every day and everybody's doing it every week that it becomes a problem.

1416
02:05:02,084 --> 02:05:03,345
So that's what I meant about it.

1417
02:05:03,505 --> 02:05:06,187
It'll take time for people to sort of change.

1418
02:05:06,607 --> 02:05:19,436
And I do think that some of the more crowded streets will see relief as people who are on, who are near less crowded streets will start to choose to park on side streets rather than the street in front of them.

1419
02:05:23,739 --> 02:05:26,421
Okay, so thank you for the clarification.

1420
02:05:26,781 --> 02:05:27,682
And again, you know,

1421
02:05:29,994 --> 02:05:32,938
I understand the things that you're saying about that, but.

1422
02:05:34,139 --> 02:05:47,276
You know, I guess I'm just speaking for myself as the resident homeowner on which, you know, like the gentleman that other gentleman that spoke said, it's, you know, it really is a tough area where we are and.

1423
02:05:48,225 --> 02:05:55,728
You know, I'm 51 years old and, you know, I don't want to be expected to change my me.

1424
02:05:55,788 --> 02:05:58,569
I'm speaking for myself, my behavior of anything.

1425
02:05:58,669 --> 02:05:59,410
I want to come home.

1426
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:03,992
I want to be able to park in front of my house like I have for 20 years and call it a day.

1427
02:06:04,912 --> 02:06:05,953
So, you know, I.

1428
02:06:07,093 --> 02:06:13,782
I don't agree with anything you just said with that, but I understand you guys all have your job to get this push through.

1429
02:06:14,843 --> 02:06:17,226
The only other thing I'll say, I know you guys said 30 seconds is.

1430
02:06:18,027 --> 02:06:21,992
I understand the pilot program, so it seems you are going to allow it for a year.

1431
02:06:22,012 --> 02:06:24,094
So you can have data from all those seasons.

1432
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:40,310
but you're hearing from the residents, and we might be a few, but we're mighty, because we're really opposed to this, and I know there's other people that are, that for whatever reason aren't on here, so just don't belittle the amount of people that are taking the time to sit here tonight.

1433
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:41,691
Yes, this is my third time speaking.

1434
02:06:41,811 --> 02:06:45,974
I'd speak 15 times if I could, but that's all I have to say.

1435
02:06:46,014 --> 02:06:47,695
Thanks for letting me speak for the third time.

1436
02:06:47,715 --> 02:06:54,119
Thank you, I appreciate your comments, and Lynn, were you last year on mute as well?

1437
02:06:55,981 --> 02:07:03,263
Hi, yes, I just wanted to address the comment that there were only like 10 people on the call.

1438
02:07:04,004 --> 02:07:08,425
A lot of people don't have computers and can't do Zoom.

1439
02:07:09,225 --> 02:07:11,886
I had to use someone's phone to do this.

1440
02:07:12,767 --> 02:07:15,708
Because my phone, I couldn't get them to hear.

1441
02:07:15,728 --> 02:07:22,450
I had over 100 signatures of people that were against this.

1442
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:26,932
And a lot of them, they don't have computers.

1443
02:07:27,373 --> 02:07:39,024
And you have, you say it's easier for people to do Zoom, but then you've taken away the privilege to people who cannot do Zoom.

1444
02:07:40,305 --> 02:07:42,848
And that is not fair at all.

1445
02:07:43,869 --> 02:07:45,551
So I think if you just

1446
02:07:46,927 --> 02:08:03,016
did not pass this and open it up to all the residents in this zone area, you would have a lot more people against it, not just the 10 or so that are on this Zoom call.

1447
02:08:04,617 --> 02:08:08,739
So that's all I had to say and thank you.

1448
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,341
Thank you as well.

1449
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:19,242
or hands up, I think that is all commissioners.

1450
02:08:21,984 --> 02:08:28,427
If there is a motion forward or if there was any comments for him or Todd.

1451
02:08:35,593 --> 02:08:51,027
The other commission is open to a periodic agenda item for this meeting where we invite folks from the neighborhood who are having issues to come here, tell us about those issues so we can brainstorm solutions.

1452
02:08:51,047 --> 02:08:57,652
This is Steve, I'd absolutely support that.

1453
02:08:59,314 --> 02:08:59,634
Okay.

1454
02:09:01,255 --> 02:09:01,476
Yes.

1455
02:09:04,372 --> 02:09:05,633
All right.

1456
02:09:05,893 --> 02:09:12,334
I mean, we could do it every three months, and we could have a regular agenda item for that year.

1457
02:09:12,774 --> 02:09:24,157
Every three months, we can open it up to the neighborhood, publicize it, let it be known out there.

1458
02:09:25,037 --> 02:09:27,858
So I would make the motion to approve this with

1459
02:09:29,789 --> 02:09:36,551
regular agenda items every three months until the year is up to check in on issues and let the residents speak.

1460
02:09:36,571 --> 02:09:39,872
Okay.

1461
02:09:40,472 --> 02:09:40,692
All right.

1462
02:09:40,712 --> 02:09:41,992
So let me read it.

1463
02:09:42,012 --> 02:09:53,755
The motion that you're proposing is to be, uh, every three months would be a agenda item here for the commission with the public in this zone.

1464
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,893
you speak on this behalf.

1465
02:09:57,433 --> 02:09:57,913
Am I correct?

1466
02:09:58,113 --> 02:10:06,536
To approve the motion and add a, with the amendment of adding an agenda item to hear from people within the zone.

1467
02:10:07,236 --> 02:10:07,597
Correct.

1468
02:10:07,697 --> 02:10:10,778
By Commissioner McKibbin and seconded by.

1469
02:10:11,438 --> 02:10:12,038
I'll second it.

1470
02:10:12,999 --> 02:10:13,679
Commissioner Hunt.

1471
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:14,459
Roll call.

1472
02:10:14,979 --> 02:10:15,840
Sergeant Rogers.

1473
02:10:21,542 --> 02:10:22,942
Commissioner Hunt.

1474
02:10:23,883 --> 02:10:24,143
Yes.

1475
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:26,371
Commissioner McGiven?

1476
02:10:27,492 --> 02:10:27,732
Yes.

1477
02:10:29,373 --> 02:10:30,314
Commissioner Velasca?

1478
02:10:31,275 --> 02:10:31,535
Yes.

1479
02:10:32,736 --> 02:10:33,857
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1480
02:10:39,241 --> 02:10:41,843
Steve, I just... I still have a vote, yes.

1481
02:10:43,705 --> 02:10:46,647
Just asking if you approve the motion by Commissioner McGiven.

1482
02:10:48,308 --> 02:10:48,548
Yes.

1483
02:10:49,449 --> 02:10:55,114
Yes, and as Chief Buckley's designee, we will also vote yes.

1484
02:10:56,163 --> 02:10:57,063
Motion passes.

1485
02:10:57,104 --> 02:10:59,725
Motion passes, five to nothing.

1486
02:11:02,266 --> 02:11:07,989
So the next agenda item we'll move forward.

1487
02:11:08,189 --> 02:11:10,270
Motion to go back to the list.

1488
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:13,672
If I can have Commissioner Schwartz to go to the top of the list.

1489
02:11:13,692 --> 02:11:21,076
24-13 is handicaps based on Riverside.

1490
02:11:21,796 --> 02:11:23,397
Did he say I need a motion to go back to order?

1491
02:11:24,218 --> 02:11:24,498
Correct.

1492
02:11:25,481 --> 02:11:26,562
Motion to go back to order.

1493
02:11:27,843 --> 02:11:28,303
Second.

1494
02:11:28,503 --> 02:11:28,884
Second.

1495
02:11:30,084 --> 02:11:31,145
By Commissioner Brzezinski.

1496
02:11:31,806 --> 02:11:34,388
And I think we'll just do an aye instead of a roll call.

1497
02:11:35,148 --> 02:11:35,729
Aye.

1498
02:11:36,289 --> 02:11:36,409
Aye.

1499
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:38,190
Anybody opposed?

1500
02:11:38,451 --> 02:11:38,571
Aye.

1501
02:11:40,132 --> 02:11:40,252
Aye.

1502
02:11:40,272 --> 02:11:42,133
Okay, no one opposed.

1503
02:11:42,634 --> 02:11:47,097
We are now moving forward to 2024-13 move Handicap Space in front of 42 Riverside Ave.

1504
02:11:52,083 --> 02:11:54,508
of this handicapped spot is presently at a meter.

1505
02:11:54,989 --> 02:11:56,332
New space will have no meter.

1506
02:11:56,352 --> 02:11:59,599
Mr. Schiller, you're up.

1507
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,906
Yes, this is the space in the corner of River Street.

1508
02:12:04,427 --> 02:12:06,028
and Riverside Avenue.

1509
02:12:07,028 --> 02:12:10,110
The meter is placed in the handicap space.

1510
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:22,336
We'd like to move it one spot to the corner, which does not have a meter, so the sign needs to move and the signage on the paint needs to be included in the space.

1511
02:12:33,035 --> 02:12:34,716
I'm supportive of that change as well.

1512
02:12:37,598 --> 02:12:38,478
Motion approved.

1513
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:40,520
Motion to approve.

1514
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,761
Seconded.

1515
02:12:43,461 --> 02:12:45,002
Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

1516
02:12:46,043 --> 02:12:46,443
Roll call.

1517
02:12:48,845 --> 02:12:49,505
Commissioner Hunt?

1518
02:12:50,426 --> 02:12:50,686
Yes.

1519
02:12:53,107 --> 02:12:53,988
Commissioner McGiven?

1520
02:12:54,748 --> 02:12:54,949
Yes.

1521
02:12:58,911 --> 02:13:00,112
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1522
02:13:01,793 --> 02:13:02,013
Yes.

1523
02:13:03,208 --> 02:13:05,190
Commissioner Velasco?

1524
02:13:06,131 --> 02:13:06,391
Yes.

1525
02:13:07,972 --> 02:13:08,573
Chief Buckley?

1526
02:13:08,593 --> 02:13:10,014
This is Desnee.

1527
02:13:10,354 --> 02:13:11,415
Yes, 5-0 vote.

1528
02:13:12,696 --> 02:13:13,777
Motion passes for 2024-13.

1529
02:13:13,817 --> 02:13:22,185
Let's take a motion to combine 15-16 and 14-15-16 combine them and be at the table for three months because the

1530
02:13:29,975 --> 02:13:47,460
So can I just get clarity, all of these people, their variances won't be necessary once the Green Line thing goes into effect, but between now, April, May, June, they actually don't have an option here.

1531
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:55,862
I mean, I don't know why any of them want their variances, but all of them are people for whom are in the zone.

1532
02:13:56,022 --> 02:13:58,243
Is that why you're suggesting we table them?

1533
02:14:01,113 --> 02:14:05,014
So yeah, the pilot program would eliminate their issues.

1534
02:14:07,135 --> 02:14:09,515
I didn't realize it was three months.

1535
02:14:10,876 --> 02:14:12,436
So they still have an issue that we have.

1536
02:14:13,436 --> 02:14:22,979
And so let's move forward with going with 2024-14 parking variance for David Black here, 96 College Ave.

1537
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,380
And I will ask you to unmute again.

1538
02:14:29,898 --> 02:14:31,218
I can summarize this time.

1539
02:14:35,259 --> 02:14:37,660
David Blackyear, 96 College Ave.

1540
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:42,461
I live between Stearns and Stanley.

1541
02:14:43,441 --> 02:14:54,523
I was issued parking permits that say College Ave, and I was told that I could park on Stanley or Stearns,

1542
02:14:56,530 --> 02:14:58,370
come to find out that's not the case.

1543
02:14:58,450 --> 02:15:00,391
I was given tickets on both streets.

1544
02:15:02,291 --> 02:15:11,032
So just two weeks ago, I got more tickets because they said I need to get a variance.

1545
02:15:11,232 --> 02:15:23,094
I assumed that because they issued the permit to call a JAB, that they understood that there's no parking on College Ave, but that they don't seem to understand that.

1546
02:15:24,115 --> 02:15:26,135
We go by the letter of the law, they said.

1547
02:15:26,577 --> 02:15:35,579
And so here I am, I, I, I have parking permits for three cars, which I paid for.

1548
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:46,742
I have guest permits, which I guess now are no good as well because they say call a jab on, I asked about why they said call a jab.

1549
02:15:46,782 --> 02:15:48,203
They said, well, that's where you live.

1550
02:15:49,363 --> 02:15:49,563
So,

1551
02:15:52,753 --> 02:16:00,157
So I would move approval, but I just, I don't, I can never keep track of the rule on visitors permits.

1552
02:16:00,177 --> 02:16:02,838
I mean, I understand the issue.

1553
02:16:02,878 --> 02:16:04,119
There's no parking on College Ave.

1554
02:16:04,159 --> 02:16:06,840
He needs a permit, so let's park on one of the side streets.

1555
02:16:08,681 --> 02:16:14,024
I'm not gonna, it seems to me this has been a long saying that you used to have options for parking there.

1556
02:16:14,044 --> 02:16:20,387
I do actually tend to ask people why do they live somewhere and have cars when there's no parking in that location.

1557
02:16:22,053 --> 02:16:26,135
But you mentioned earlier that Tufts used to accommodate you with parking.

1558
02:16:26,155 --> 02:16:29,776
And it's recent that the permit parking has come into effect.

1559
02:16:30,656 --> 02:16:31,037
Correct.

1560
02:16:31,717 --> 02:16:31,957
Right.

1561
02:16:32,677 --> 02:16:42,721
And like I said, not many people remember it, but there was parking on both sides of College Ave in front of Elliot Pearson and in front of my house.

1562
02:16:43,842 --> 02:16:44,042
Yeah.

1563
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:46,501
that we take away.

1564
02:16:47,201 --> 02:16:48,742
I think there is parking on college.

1565
02:16:48,782 --> 02:16:51,303
It's just further down on one side now.

1566
02:16:51,543 --> 02:16:52,444
I understand that.

1567
02:16:52,624 --> 02:16:55,205
It's irrelevant.

1568
02:16:55,305 --> 02:16:56,265
It's not really near you.

1569
02:16:57,046 --> 02:16:57,686
That's correct.

1570
02:16:59,167 --> 02:17:03,609
I second the motion for approval.

1571
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:08,232
Commissioner Hunt is making the motion and Commissioner McGiven second it.

1572
02:17:08,652 --> 02:17:09,152
Roll call.

1573
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:22,202
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1574
02:17:22,482 --> 02:17:22,843
Approve.

1575
02:17:23,583 --> 02:17:24,844
Commissioner McGiven?

1576
02:17:25,525 --> 02:17:25,765
Yes.

1577
02:17:26,426 --> 02:17:27,167
Commissioner Hunt?

1578
02:17:27,707 --> 02:17:27,967
Yes.

1579
02:17:28,508 --> 02:17:29,449
Commissioner Villescaz?

1580
02:17:30,149 --> 02:17:30,430
Yes.

1581
02:17:31,130 --> 02:17:40,619
And myself, as Chief Buckley's designee, yes, that's 5-0 for the permit for David Black here, 96 College Ave.

1582
02:17:44,153 --> 02:17:46,137
Can I ask what I need to do now?

1583
02:17:46,418 --> 02:17:48,442
Go back and get new permits?

1584
02:17:49,544 --> 02:17:52,630
Or am I still, am I good with the ones I have?

1585
02:17:53,917 --> 02:17:56,578
Well, Jim, you want to speak on that?

1586
02:17:57,078 --> 02:17:57,358
Yes.

1587
02:17:58,678 --> 02:18:10,680
So for this year, you will need to go to the parking department and actually get your permits so that we will also issue the variance, which we will do when we get the minutes.

1588
02:18:10,961 --> 02:18:12,801
So you have to give it a few days.

1589
02:18:13,021 --> 02:18:15,762
I would recommend next week, starting Monday.

1590
02:18:15,782 --> 02:18:22,403
This gives us an opportunity to update the database so that the parking department sees this variance was approved.

1591
02:18:23,143 --> 02:18:24,584
Tuesday, Monday is a holiday.

1592
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:25,885
Sorry, Tuesday.

1593
02:18:25,965 --> 02:18:26,546
Thank you, Todd.

1594
02:18:27,426 --> 02:18:32,570
Okay, but what are these parking permits going to say now?

1595
02:18:35,532 --> 02:18:41,737
Your variance on the street of variance, so was the variance granted to Stanley of Stearns

1596
02:18:43,834 --> 02:18:47,177
Well, right now you have a pilot program, so it doesn't matter.

1597
02:18:48,098 --> 02:18:49,639
For three months it matters.

1598
02:18:49,859 --> 02:18:52,521
That's not until July 1st, unfortunately.

1599
02:18:52,881 --> 02:19:05,952
But you still need to buy those resident parking passes so that you will, your car will, for the year 2024, when this is implemented in July, that you will be able to park.

1600
02:19:05,972 --> 02:19:09,654
So I can buy them again?

1601
02:19:10,978 --> 02:19:14,221
No, you buy them once this year.

1602
02:19:14,521 --> 02:19:15,602
You bought them in January.

1603
02:19:15,742 --> 02:19:16,523
In January.

1604
02:19:17,103 --> 02:19:17,684
In January 2024.

1605
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:22,508
Okay, so you don't need to go back.

1606
02:19:22,528 --> 02:19:27,432
The variants will be issued on our database and parking will have that.

1607
02:19:27,572 --> 02:19:29,834
So they should stop ticketing your process.

1608
02:19:30,114 --> 02:19:32,236
Okay, now let me ask this.

1609
02:19:32,936 --> 02:19:36,119
What do I do with all the tickets I've gotten since January?

1610
02:19:37,297 --> 02:19:40,680
We should take that question offline from the commission meeting.

1611
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:44,963
The commission doesn't have anything to do with parking tickets.

1612
02:19:46,464 --> 02:19:56,352
Any tickets that were issued, if you have a ticket that was issued and it was either you have appealed it and it was declined, then the issue would be bringing it back up through the city.

1613
02:19:56,632 --> 02:19:57,893
We can go over that.

1614
02:19:58,433 --> 02:20:00,295
You and I, Dave, over that.

1615
02:20:01,395 --> 02:20:05,639
In regard to this current process, I think I would suggest that

1616
02:20:06,299 --> 02:20:14,406
If I may, to either Tim or Alicia, re-motion to pick Stearns or Stanley for the three months until we get to July.

1617
02:20:14,546 --> 02:20:16,588
The motion was for Stanley, yeah.

1618
02:20:16,668 --> 02:20:24,714
Okay, because I do have data that says Stanley currently has more permits than Stearns, so Stearns might be the better street.

1619
02:20:26,215 --> 02:20:27,396
David, if you live there and

1620
02:20:29,272 --> 02:20:31,573
Your request had Stanley Ave on it.

1621
02:20:31,633 --> 02:20:36,196
I assume that's because you feel there's more parking on Stanley Ave and you'd be able to find spaces there.

1622
02:20:37,397 --> 02:20:43,240
You know, the data you have doesn't support what I see every day.

1623
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,463
There is much more, many more cars on Stearns than there is on Stanley.

1624
02:20:50,064 --> 02:20:53,806
Okay, let's see.

1625
02:20:54,286 --> 02:20:55,527
The variance states Stanley Ave.

1626
02:20:55,567 --> 02:20:56,927
We're sticking with the Stanley Ave.

1627
02:20:57,007 --> 02:20:57,548
We've moved over.

1628
02:20:58,752 --> 02:20:59,452
We're going with that.

1629
02:20:59,793 --> 02:21:00,753
You've been explained there.

1630
02:21:01,694 --> 02:21:04,576
If you have any questions offline, Dave, we can talk on that.

1631
02:21:05,316 --> 02:21:05,897
Absolutely.

1632
02:21:05,937 --> 02:21:06,717
I appreciate it.

1633
02:21:07,197 --> 02:21:10,720
Thanks.

1634
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:20,006
Moving forward to 2024-15, permit parking variance for 9 Edwards Place or Edwards Streets.

1635
02:21:23,848 --> 02:21:24,769
I just asked you on mute.

1636
02:21:28,401 --> 02:21:29,462
Hi, yeah, that's me.

1637
02:21:30,062 --> 02:21:35,528
So, I'm residing in a 9 Edward place.

1638
02:21:36,769 --> 02:21:42,475
So, my thing is actually, I need a. Parking permit for my vehicle.

1639
02:21:43,616 --> 02:21:50,843
And I need a variance because as for the records, there are two parking spots in Edward Place, the 9 Edward Place.

1640
02:21:51,204 --> 02:21:56,188
However, the thing is like the parking spots are like very narrow.

1641
02:21:56,208 --> 02:22:00,392
So second thing, there's already one vehicle that's parked over here and

1642
02:22:01,333 --> 02:22:06,857
Because my vehicle is quite bigger than that, I have Nishan Roog.

1643
02:22:06,897 --> 02:22:09,539
It doesn't enter the parking spot at all.

1644
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:17,085
If we try to park it or take it out, there are high chances that we are going to collide with the other vehicle.

1645
02:22:17,746 --> 02:22:22,829
That's why I was requesting a variance in order to have a parking permit for Edward Street instead.

1646
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:28,634
Any questions?

1647
02:22:31,095 --> 02:22:34,336
So your car is too big to fit in the spot that you currently have.

1648
02:22:35,036 --> 02:22:35,897
Yeah, exactly.

1649
02:22:36,037 --> 02:22:56,424
And also, like, there is a bar on the other side, because, like, on the other side of the, you know, like, there's a parking spot, but, like, they have the bar over there in order to separate their parking spot and our parking spot, and our side has two spots, and that makes it really difficult for us to park.

1650
02:22:56,464 --> 02:22:59,085
Like, we have tried, but we cannot park inside it.

1651
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:10,203
This is, again, an issue of why do you live somewhere where you don't have space for your vehicle?

1652
02:23:11,888 --> 02:23:15,151
Because the thing is like we have to rent first thing.

1653
02:23:15,771 --> 02:23:21,416
Second thing we also want to see things like my mom and dad they have to like go for work.

1654
02:23:21,877 --> 02:23:28,062
So I also want to see my dad is the one who rides the vehicle and my mom is the one who needs to like take the bus.

1655
02:23:28,462 --> 02:23:31,405
She's not very well but she's like she needs to work also.

1656
02:23:31,445 --> 02:23:34,047
So we were trying to find somewhere like affordable

1657
02:23:34,567 --> 02:23:38,430
somewhere reasonable and somewhere like she can easily have the bus access as well.

1658
02:23:38,470 --> 02:23:40,131
So that was the reason.

1659
02:23:40,191 --> 02:23:47,857
When I tried speaking with the parking team first, they advised me that to come to the city halls and ask for the parking permit.

1660
02:23:47,877 --> 02:23:50,579
They didn't talk about the variance with me.

1661
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:55,483
This is one of the thing I spoke with them, they didn't talk about variance or anything at all.

1662
02:23:55,783 --> 02:23:58,645
Once I reached that then, the issue of the variance was brought up.

1663
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:04,792
And honestly, I don't know.

1664
02:24:04,832 --> 02:24:06,273
Is it like you guys or something?

1665
02:24:06,853 --> 02:24:10,576
But it's been really difficult for us with the Medford city.

1666
02:24:10,656 --> 02:24:15,420
We were residing before in Somerville and we never had something like these kind of issues.

1667
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:22,946
But yeah, with Medford, like there has always been like something going on again and again and again.

1668
02:24:23,066 --> 02:24:25,208
So I don't know what to say more than that.

1669
02:24:26,861 --> 02:24:34,664
So the reason why you wouldn't have the issue in Somerville is because it's city-wide resident permit parking, so you would have got a permit to park on any street in Somerville that has a resident permit.

1670
02:24:35,964 --> 02:24:41,666
Edward Place is a private way, it looks like, and it's too narrow to provide on-street parking, it looks like.

1671
02:24:41,706 --> 02:24:45,908
It looks like it's essentially an alleyway, if that helps anybody.

1672
02:24:46,428 --> 02:24:50,269
You can't get street view on it because it's a private way, so it's hard to see the situation.

1673
02:24:54,010 --> 02:24:55,471
Is there capacity on Edward Street?

1674
02:25:00,135 --> 02:25:01,336
I don't know the answer to that.

1675
02:25:02,876 --> 02:25:04,177
Commissioner, I didn't hear what you said.

1676
02:25:04,197 --> 02:25:04,978
What was it?

1677
02:25:05,158 --> 02:25:06,959
Is it capacity on Edward Street?

1678
02:25:06,979 --> 02:25:12,782
I don't think so.

1679
02:25:12,802 --> 02:25:13,902
No, I don't think so either.

1680
02:25:13,922 --> 02:25:26,969
I mean, it's 1,500 feet long, five blocks worth of spaces, whatever that's worth.

1681
02:25:29,016 --> 02:25:31,100
And what kind of car did you have, ma'am, that is too big?

1682
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:31,782
Nissan Rogue.

1683
02:25:32,182 --> 02:25:33,144
A Nissan Rogue.

1684
02:25:33,425 --> 02:25:33,786
Rogue.

1685
02:25:34,487 --> 02:25:36,671
Is that just a typical SUV?

1686
02:25:36,952 --> 02:25:37,112
Yeah.

1687
02:25:40,835 --> 02:26:02,743
The things like, if there was not other vehicle that was like, parked over here, we won't have the issue or like, for the matter of fact, if there was like, not the bar that they have, like, said the other houses that we could have adjusted it actually, but like, they, we were told that they recently created a bar over there, which like, really narrows down the space for us.

1688
02:26:06,095 --> 02:26:13,177
If you didn't get a variance, it looks like you would park on Main Street is the closest street probably without permit.

1689
02:26:14,057 --> 02:26:15,477
Is that where you currently park?

1690
02:26:16,438 --> 02:26:22,079
Actually, right now we are doing that too in our uncle's house who lives in Somerville.

1691
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:30,101
But it's been kind of difficult because like my dad has to go to his place to like get the car if he has to go for the work.

1692
02:26:32,965 --> 02:26:41,590
And that's also not much possible because they were thinking this was a temporary thing, but it's been quite a while now.

1693
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:45,693
Yeah, Todd, I wasn't able to pull it up.

1694
02:26:48,698 --> 02:26:52,181
So yeah, so can you see that screen, the area?

1695
02:26:52,201 --> 02:26:52,422
Yeah.

1696
02:26:53,002 --> 02:26:54,724
Edwards Place 9 is back here.

1697
02:26:54,744 --> 02:26:59,128
This is, if you look street view from here, it's like essentially an alleyway.

1698
02:26:59,788 --> 02:27:03,011
So it's not like this on street that the private way can institute.

1699
02:27:03,612 --> 02:27:13,201
But from above, I was looking at this section of Maine doesn't have permit parking and that's, if you go out here and walk around the block,

1700
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:19,574
You could park right here is probably what they'd have to do if they didn't get a variance somewhere over here.

1701
02:27:19,594 --> 02:27:30,261
Because main street does not have restrictions, just street sweeping.

1702
02:27:31,602 --> 02:27:33,564
I'm okay with the variance.

1703
02:27:33,904 --> 02:27:37,947
My question, I think all the time with these is, is there enough room for another car?

1704
02:27:43,881 --> 02:27:49,426
Are you saying that just the capacity are you saying the size because she's having issues as well, not the size of the vehicle.

1705
02:27:49,446 --> 02:27:51,969
I just wanted to make sure she wasn't talking about like a Mac truck or something.

1706
02:27:52,029 --> 02:27:54,711
It's a normal size as far as I can tell.

1707
02:27:55,973 --> 02:28:03,060
And I don't necessarily have an issue with a variance to park on Edward street for for this young lady and her family.

1708
02:28:04,337 --> 02:28:07,578
It's more of, are we pushing out another car if we do that?

1709
02:28:07,598 --> 02:28:09,058
Any issues?

1710
02:28:09,719 --> 02:28:11,499
Is that street already full?

1711
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:22,382
One of the things that our process does not do is notify neighbors when somebody is asking for a variance, because then you know we'd be, hey, here, every neighbor would say, we don't want another car parking on our street.

1712
02:28:22,402 --> 02:28:23,962
Correct.

1713
02:28:24,963 --> 02:28:32,385
Edward, the place we've never had an issue, I can't say for certain, that is

1714
02:28:33,435 --> 02:28:34,235
on Edward Street?

1715
02:28:35,376 --> 02:28:36,676
Is full or not?

1716
02:28:37,157 --> 02:28:39,178
Commission is Sergeant Rogers.

1717
02:28:39,278 --> 02:28:41,238
I don't see a problem on Edward Street.

1718
02:28:41,378 --> 02:28:41,599
No.

1719
02:28:41,979 --> 02:28:45,680
I patrol it every so often, and there's plenty of room.

1720
02:28:46,541 --> 02:28:46,641
OK.

1721
02:28:47,221 --> 02:28:47,981
I move approval then.

1722
02:28:49,382 --> 02:28:49,582
All right.

1723
02:28:49,842 --> 02:28:50,262
Second.

1724
02:28:51,023 --> 02:28:52,183
Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

1725
02:28:52,283 --> 02:28:52,843
Roll call.

1726
02:28:55,285 --> 02:28:56,365
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1727
02:28:58,626 --> 02:28:58,866
Yes.

1728
02:28:59,967 --> 02:29:00,627
Commissioner Hunt?

1729
02:29:02,648 --> 02:29:02,848
Yes.

1730
02:29:03,784 --> 02:29:04,624
Commissioner McGibbon?

1731
02:29:05,184 --> 02:29:05,465
Yes.

1732
02:29:06,405 --> 02:29:07,425
Commissioner Falasca?

1733
02:29:10,486 --> 02:29:10,786
Yes.

1734
02:29:12,107 --> 02:29:13,407
Sergeant Canaldo?

1735
02:29:13,427 --> 02:29:15,908
Yes, 5-0, the clearance passes.

1736
02:29:18,909 --> 02:29:27,611
Okay, as stated before, you know, just the holiday is on Monday, so give it some time and should be there on Tuesday.

1737
02:29:28,091 --> 02:29:29,672
And we're moving on to

1738
02:29:30,797 --> 02:29:38,584
2024-16 for 48 Winthrop Street for Capon or Emery Street.

1739
02:29:40,045 --> 02:29:46,130
Ryan, if you are, there you are.

1740
02:29:46,150 --> 02:29:48,792
I'm going to ask you on mute.

1741
02:29:50,674 --> 02:29:51,495
Hello, everyone.

1742
02:29:51,535 --> 02:29:52,375
Can you hear me just fine?

1743
02:29:52,976 --> 02:29:53,216
Yes.

1744
02:29:54,277 --> 02:29:54,577
Perfect.

1745
02:29:54,617 --> 02:29:55,178
Thank you so much.

1746
02:29:55,954 --> 02:29:57,976
My name's Ryan Rocket, 48 Winthrop Street.

1747
02:29:59,217 --> 02:30:00,198
Pretty straightforward.

1748
02:30:00,418 --> 02:30:08,465
I live on Winthrop Street in an area where there is no street parking, and Capon Street and Emory Street are the two side streets in between.

1749
02:30:09,006 --> 02:30:14,791
And so parking variance for either one of those streets will be very appreciated.

1750
02:30:14,931 --> 02:30:15,171
Thank you.

1751
02:30:33,967 --> 02:30:35,728
I'm just trying to pull it up as well here.

1752
02:30:57,162 --> 02:30:58,243
You want me to put it up, Jordan?

1753
02:30:58,703 --> 02:31:00,765
Yeah, if you got it, that would be awesome, Todd.

1754
02:31:00,805 --> 02:31:01,125
Thank you.

1755
02:31:03,330 --> 02:31:15,041
I know that Chapin Street is not, so when I was looking at our green line, it says excludes Chapin Street for the new map.

1756
02:31:15,421 --> 02:31:19,384
Do they not have permit parking or it's just outside of the new zone?

1757
02:31:21,196 --> 02:31:32,005
It's out regular keeping streets outside the new zone East keeping is is a private way on the side of winter that is within the zone.

1758
02:31:32,025 --> 02:31:38,991
Because there was some comment earlier that this would be handled by the new Green Line zone.

1759
02:31:39,611 --> 02:31:40,212
No, it wouldn't.

1760
02:31:40,292 --> 02:31:44,475
His address on that side of the street be eligible to be in the Green Line zone.

1761
02:31:44,895 --> 02:31:47,518
It's just that then none of these streets

1762
02:31:49,497 --> 02:31:52,619
The streets near him are not in the zone, which is weird.

1763
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:57,884
The current map that we have for the geo zones is the odd side of Wentworth Street.

1764
02:31:59,985 --> 02:32:04,429
So this would not actually be covered by the new zone we were just discussing.

1765
02:32:05,209 --> 02:32:05,469
No.

1766
02:32:05,550 --> 02:32:13,596
If we ever went to more zones or an expanded zone, then the west side would likely be captured by another zone, if and when that ever came to fruition.

1767
02:32:15,778 --> 02:32:16,038
Right.

1768
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:18,580
OK.

1769
02:32:22,595 --> 02:32:32,081
I feel like that it's the right thing to do is that I need to keep asking people, why are you living somewhere and have a car but there's no parking?

1770
02:32:33,162 --> 02:32:34,062
How does this happen?

1771
02:32:34,643 --> 02:32:41,547
Part of that is because as the planning director, I need to understand how this happens so we can plan appropriately in the future.

1772
02:32:41,567 --> 02:32:50,293
I think Ryan,

1773
02:32:52,270 --> 02:32:57,512
I don't know if he's... I'm asking him to unmute, so if you want to unmute.

1774
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:00,501
Hi, sorry, yeah, I can, I can meet myself now.

1775
02:33:01,561 --> 02:33:04,722
Yeah, I, I was not made aware.

1776
02:33:04,742 --> 02:33:15,006
I'm a tenant who is renting in this house and I was made aware that there is a driveway, which is great.

1777
02:33:15,166 --> 02:33:20,187
However, there are also 7 other tenants in this house and there are more cars.

1778
02:33:22,948 --> 02:33:29,749
more people own cars in this house than there are available driveway spaces, so that leaves a few odd people out, unfortunately.

1779
02:33:29,769 --> 02:33:32,030
Right.

1780
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:35,490
Perhaps, does that come back to the real estate agent or the landlord?

1781
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:39,991
I'm just partially trying to understand where these disconnects are happening.

1782
02:33:40,831 --> 02:33:48,593
We did go out there when we were talking about this and we went over some of the things for an issue with the landlords.

1783
02:33:50,908 --> 02:33:57,110
were never advising people when they were sending renting programs out.

1784
02:33:57,170 --> 02:34:00,731
There was never any mention of parking or no parking.

1785
02:34:00,751 --> 02:34:01,911
There was never mentioning of that.

1786
02:34:01,971 --> 02:34:14,495
I can only speak for those, but it seems like the landlords weren't issuing no parking and were saying that they were on street parking, even though there wasn't on street parking in some of the issues that we were going over a couple months back.

1787
02:34:16,456 --> 02:34:19,397
So I would assume it would probably be the landlord.

1788
02:34:20,933 --> 02:34:21,453
at this point.

1789
02:34:22,834 --> 02:34:23,194
Thank you.

1790
02:34:23,234 --> 02:34:25,716
I mean, it's helpful to understand that.

1791
02:34:25,776 --> 02:34:29,638
So I guess the question is, does one of these streets have space?

1792
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:36,222
Alicia, if I can comment, both streets are tight.

1793
02:34:36,783 --> 02:34:38,764
Capen Street is one side parking.

1794
02:34:40,065 --> 02:34:43,127
But in the end, there's no parking on one side of the street.

1795
02:34:45,843 --> 02:34:55,890
Well, I think my question is mostly he's asking for us to decide whether he should have parked, you know, which street he gets the permit parking on.

1796
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:59,653
So my question is, which street has space?

1797
02:35:00,854 --> 02:35:01,915
I would say Capon.

1798
02:35:05,357 --> 02:35:06,878
So we'll move in promotion.

1799
02:35:06,898 --> 02:35:10,921
I would approve it for Capon, I think would be the better option than Emory.

1800
02:35:17,835 --> 02:35:18,215
All right.

1801
02:35:18,976 --> 02:35:20,296
What do the other commissioners think?

1802
02:35:20,336 --> 02:35:30,161
Or I'll move to... Commissioner Brzezinski, I would support the motion.

1803
02:35:30,241 --> 02:35:41,287
Alicia, you do bring up a good point about this, you know, who's not disclosing to these tenants in these high volume parts of town, whether you have on-site parking or not.

1804
02:35:41,327 --> 02:35:43,348
This is not the first time we've dealt with this issue.

1805
02:35:43,368 --> 02:35:44,509
It's actually multiple times.

1806
02:35:45,455 --> 02:36:03,525
I'd implore the city to actually look into this a little bit more and try to bring down some, you know, some restrictions on these landlords and these leasing agents on these kids, particularly those who are leasing these properties from out of town, these tough kids who are just leasing them online and not really getting a chance to see these properties up front.

1807
02:36:03,625 --> 02:36:08,908
But I'd support the motion and make the motion if need be.

1808
02:36:08,928 --> 02:36:09,989
Okay.

1809
02:36:10,489 --> 02:36:11,470
Do we have a motion?

1810
02:36:15,683 --> 02:36:19,184
That was by Commissioner Brzezinski and seconded by Commissioner Hunt, roll call.

1811
02:36:22,966 --> 02:36:24,006
Commissioner Brzezinski.

1812
02:36:26,307 --> 02:36:26,567
Yes.

1813
02:36:27,327 --> 02:36:27,967
Commissioner Hunt.

1814
02:36:28,648 --> 02:36:28,988
Yes.

1815
02:36:29,648 --> 02:36:30,488
Commissioner McGiven.

1816
02:36:31,269 --> 02:36:31,509
Yes.

1817
02:36:32,129 --> 02:36:33,229
Commissioner Velasco.

1818
02:36:35,390 --> 02:36:35,830
Yes.

1819
02:36:36,350 --> 02:36:37,911
Vice President Cannava.

1820
02:36:37,971 --> 02:36:40,532
Yes, five nothing, then our vote passes.

1821
02:36:41,112 --> 02:36:43,293
Before you move to the next item, I'm just gonna say this.

1822
02:36:44,403 --> 02:36:47,605
It's for things like the city does not know who all the landlords are.

1823
02:36:47,745 --> 02:36:48,946
We do not have a list of them.

1824
02:36:49,046 --> 02:36:51,587
We do not have any way to contact them reliably.

1825
02:36:51,728 --> 02:36:55,750
We can send paper mail to owners, property owners.

1826
02:36:56,410 --> 02:37:13,181
It is one of the reasons why my office and the health office and the building office have asked the city council to adopt a rental registry like they have in a lot of other communities that have high numbers of renters so that we have a way to communicate reliably to the landlords and to

1827
02:37:13,681 --> 02:37:17,942
to connect to who they are or their management agencies.

1828
02:37:17,962 --> 02:37:32,926
And there has, so people should know that that's in front of city council and there's all sorts of misinformation and hate spewing about that from groups of people who do not want us to have a list of who all the landlords in the city are.

1829
02:37:33,767 --> 02:37:36,167
So I just want you to know that we don't know who they are.

1830
02:37:36,187 --> 02:37:38,628
Okay, yep, that's.

1831
02:37:39,775 --> 02:37:43,557
Is it something that's been brought up at Tufts as well for the students to be?

1832
02:37:44,338 --> 02:37:54,683
We do get a list of addresses that students live at, but what we don't get with that is contact for the landlord or rental agency.

1833
02:37:55,744 --> 02:38:06,055
So, we have done this in the past with some projects that are coming up for just police and I don't know if this would be helpful, but we've worked with the communications department at tops.

1834
02:38:06,155 --> 02:38:12,522
If we have a detail, we're going to have a detour or something where they would send an email out and blast and email to the students and maybe that.

1835
02:38:13,625 --> 02:38:24,660
would be helpful for them if they're understanding that this is coming from Tufts and somebody that they're receiving emails from, they would be more apt to understand the process of parking throughout Medford.

1836
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,085
And if they can get it directed to a website, that would probably be helpful on everyone's end.

1837
02:38:30,158 --> 02:38:47,091
And if I could take 30 seconds to give a plug, if you're a Tufts student who's full-time student that doesn't have a full-time job and doesn't necessarily need a car to get to a job further away, I'd strongly encourage you to walk, bike, or transit if you don't need to bring that car to Medford.

1838
02:38:47,351 --> 02:38:47,631
Thanks.

1839
02:38:48,612 --> 02:38:51,754
Students can get parking at Tufts for $50 a month.

1840
02:38:53,225 --> 02:39:05,992
But they're not because they're renting and the rental agreements that we've spoke to them about their issues when we either we've tagged multiple issues and multiple locations and their statements are that.

1841
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:14,703
When they originally rented these properties, they're stating that they can park on street and or they have parking and that is not the case.

1842
02:39:15,384 --> 02:39:15,644
Right.

1843
02:39:16,324 --> 02:39:25,388
But I'm just saying after the fact, it doesn't matter where you live, any Tufts student can pay $50 a month to park in the garage.

1844
02:39:26,468 --> 02:39:30,170
That's something I've confirmed with university relations with Rocco.

1845
02:39:31,490 --> 02:39:35,252
The off-campus students could keep their cars in the parking garage at Tufts.

1846
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:40,682
They're never going to do that.

1847
02:39:40,702 --> 02:39:49,505
God will give them a ride to work.

1848
02:39:49,525 --> 02:39:54,987
So next is 2024-17, 11 Walcart commercial vehicle parking issue for Paula.

1849
02:39:57,287 --> 02:39:59,208
I'm not sure if I saw her.

1850
02:39:59,428 --> 02:40:04,150
Paula, if you're here, please raise your hand and or

1851
02:40:06,134 --> 02:40:08,895
I think there's only two people left.

1852
02:40:08,915 --> 02:40:12,097
It's S-T-U-A-R and Fred.

1853
02:40:12,117 --> 02:40:15,558
So I'll give it a minute here.

1854
02:40:15,618 --> 02:40:21,161
If you're having issues and you haven't called in, you can send in the chat if you're having issues.

1855
02:40:21,181 --> 02:40:23,822
But if not, we're going to move to table this.

1856
02:40:24,042 --> 02:40:29,584
I think we'll move the motion to table this.

1857
02:40:29,664 --> 02:40:31,985
If anybody would like to motion.

1858
02:40:34,766 --> 02:40:35,707
Yeah, motion to table.

1859
02:40:36,954 --> 02:40:37,354
Second.

1860
02:40:40,876 --> 02:40:41,216
Second.

1861
02:40:42,036 --> 02:40:42,957
Commissioner Brzezinski.

1862
02:40:44,578 --> 02:40:50,100
And no need for a roll call, just an aye.

1863
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:50,640
How's that?

1864
02:40:51,201 --> 02:40:52,341
Yes, aye.

1865
02:40:53,742 --> 02:40:53,882
Aye.

1866
02:40:54,702 --> 02:40:54,822
Aye.

1867
02:40:56,383 --> 02:40:58,804
And no nays.

1868
02:40:59,585 --> 02:41:00,085
There we go.

1869
02:41:00,145 --> 02:41:00,685
Five, nothing.

1870
02:41:00,705 --> 02:41:04,547
We're going to table this as the party is not there.

1871
02:41:05,907 --> 02:41:06,748
We're just taking it off?

1872
02:41:07,268 --> 02:41:09,349
No, no, I just asked you to go.

1873
02:41:09,849 --> 02:41:11,911
Oh yeah, go ahead, sorry.

1874
02:41:11,931 --> 02:41:12,711
Chief Buckley's back.

1875
02:41:12,871 --> 02:41:15,453
You're doing a good job.

1876
02:41:15,473 --> 02:41:20,456
2024-18 on petition, no parking here to corner of Fulton Street at each corner of Maple Park Avenue.

1877
02:41:21,897 --> 02:41:22,597
Todd, is this you?

1878
02:41:24,958 --> 02:41:25,719
No, it's not me.

1879
02:41:26,919 --> 02:41:27,640
I think it was a resident.

1880
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:29,261
Petitioner present, can you raise your hand?

1881
02:41:31,189 --> 02:41:33,709
indicate somehow your willingness to speak.

1882
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:36,830
STUAR is the only one that we don't know who it is.

1883
02:41:39,891 --> 02:41:42,591
Bolton Street to Connor of Maple Park Ave.

1884
02:41:43,971 --> 02:41:48,272
The petition was submitted by someone named Stuart, and that's S-T-U-A-R.

1885
02:41:48,992 --> 02:41:50,272
I will ask Stuart to unmute.

1886
02:41:50,372 --> 02:41:50,832
How's that?

1887
02:41:50,852 --> 02:41:56,793
I'm not seeing... S-T-U-A-R is mute.

1888
02:41:57,474 --> 02:41:57,874
Hello.

1889
02:41:57,914 --> 02:41:58,254
Hi.

1890
02:41:58,314 --> 02:41:58,874
Hello.

1891
02:41:59,194 --> 02:41:59,794
There we go.

1892
02:42:01,511 --> 02:42:02,231
Welcome.

1893
02:42:02,311 --> 02:42:03,332
Is this your petition?

1894
02:42:03,632 --> 02:42:05,173
No parking on Bradshaw.

1895
02:42:05,193 --> 02:42:05,633
No, sorry.

1896
02:42:05,673 --> 02:42:07,293
No parking on Fulton Street.

1897
02:42:07,313 --> 02:42:16,497
No parking sign to the corner from Fulton Street to Maple Park on both sides.

1898
02:42:17,717 --> 02:42:19,418
My name is Stuart Gordon.

1899
02:42:19,958 --> 02:42:22,679
I live at 65 Valley Street, apartment 5C.

1900
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:23,039
Welcome.

1901
02:42:26,488 --> 02:42:35,042
And it's very hard to get out of Maple Park Ave when you're going right or left onto Fulton Street.

1902
02:42:35,483 --> 02:42:39,389
You cannot see the cars or vehicles coming down until

1903
02:42:40,932 --> 02:42:47,117
the last car, they're passing the last car and they're doing 20, 25 miles an hour.

1904
02:42:47,797 --> 02:42:56,564
And you have to pull out a little bit and most of the cars have to swerve around you so they don't hit you.

1905
02:42:57,144 --> 02:43:06,692
And now with the Gillis Park redone and the Heckner Center going into effect and being redone, we're gonna have a lot of traffic on Maple Park Ave.

1906
02:43:07,947 --> 02:43:15,089
And it would be easier for us to get out of, um, and the cards to get out of, um, maybe, um, maple Park Ave.

1907
02:43:15,870 --> 02:43:24,492
If we have a little more room to see what's going on on, uh, from the fells way, all the way down to maple Park Ave.

1908
02:43:31,695 --> 02:43:31,835
Right.

1909
02:43:35,651 --> 02:43:36,652
Yeah, we're looking at it now.

1910
02:43:36,672 --> 02:43:39,233
I don't know if you could see a screen, but we're just the commission.

1911
02:43:39,554 --> 02:43:40,114
I can see it.

1912
02:43:40,654 --> 02:43:41,195
I can see it.

1913
02:43:41,575 --> 02:43:44,077
It's, uh, on the picture.

1914
02:43:44,217 --> 02:43:48,800
It's, uh, um, the, the picture they have now, they always parked at the curb.

1915
02:43:49,300 --> 02:44:00,047
And if you across from the building across the street, that whole line is, um, covered with cars and you can't see him coming down when the cars are there.

1916
02:44:01,028 --> 02:44:01,148
Okay.

1917
02:44:02,077 --> 02:44:05,622
coming down from the Felsway down to Maple Park Ave.

1918
02:44:07,865 --> 02:44:08,846
And it's hard to get out.

1919
02:44:10,007 --> 02:44:19,280
Plenty of times I've gone out and had to stop and look pretty good and all of a sudden they come down and I've had to put on the brakes pretty quick and they've had to swerve.

1920
02:44:20,970 --> 02:44:33,441
I think I sent a video to Alva Erickson showing what it looks like with all the cars parked there and how at the last minute you can see the cars coming down the road.

1921
02:44:36,589 --> 02:44:39,793
Yeah, you may have, and I apologize, but Ms.

1922
02:44:39,833 --> 02:44:41,074
Erickson had a death in the family.

1923
02:44:41,134 --> 02:44:49,823
We don't have that access to that right now, but we're going to try to look at this, see if we can change a date, maybe catch a glimpse of all the cars that might be parked there.

1924
02:44:50,163 --> 02:44:53,547
But having said that, I mean, we naturally have

1925
02:44:54,968 --> 02:44:56,628
restrictions on parking near corners.

1926
02:44:56,688 --> 02:45:08,131
Now, I state that and understand that it doesn't always happen, and sometimes having signs placed there is a great reminder and will clear up for safety purposes.

1927
02:45:10,812 --> 02:45:13,353
Director of Transportation Todd, have you looked at this?

1928
02:45:13,413 --> 02:45:15,793
I mean, I know my traffic guys have gone out there and looked at it.

1929
02:45:15,813 --> 02:45:22,315
Chief, if I could just comment, I think majority of the owner of those cars live in Maple Park.

1930
02:45:24,006 --> 02:45:24,687
No, they don't.

1931
02:45:25,107 --> 02:45:28,349
They live across the street in the other building.

1932
02:45:30,930 --> 02:45:31,830
On the Felsway?

1933
02:45:32,471 --> 02:45:38,014
Yeah, we have 57 indoor spaces in our parking lot.

1934
02:45:38,354 --> 02:45:43,497
So the people who live in Maple Park usually park in the parking lot or in their indoor parking spaces.

1935
02:45:44,137 --> 02:45:46,238
And we only have 44 units.

1936
02:45:49,028 --> 02:45:50,589
Yeah, Chief, I did look at it.

1937
02:45:50,649 --> 02:46:04,994
I think it would be helpful, especially towards Fellsway, that one in particular, because that's the same side of the street as you, whereas the other side, even if it's crowded, you have a little buffer because the traffic's in the opposite traveling.

1938
02:46:05,034 --> 02:46:08,136
But there's an existing 20-foot rule from the corner, as we all know.

1939
02:46:08,596 --> 02:46:12,077
In this case, I think both could use 30 feet at least.

1940
02:46:12,857 --> 02:46:16,499
Yeah, that's the area there, across from the highway.

1941
02:46:17,277 --> 02:46:17,537
Yep.

1942
02:46:17,697 --> 02:46:18,378
That's the worst.

1943
02:46:18,458 --> 02:46:22,661
I think that corner is the more egregious of the two because it's the same side.

1944
02:46:22,941 --> 02:46:26,403
It's the immediate travel lane that's closest to you when you're trying to exit Maple.

1945
02:46:27,964 --> 02:46:28,164
Yeah.

1946
02:46:28,325 --> 02:46:29,145
Nobody's parked.

1947
02:46:29,185 --> 02:46:35,890
This picture shows no one parked there, but you cannot see cars coming down from the Felsworth when they're all parked along that side.

1948
02:46:37,482 --> 02:46:44,349
Yeah, if it's 30 feet, it would be like two squares over from the telephone pole, roughly, Jordan, or whoever's navigating.

1949
02:46:44,569 --> 02:46:48,653
I mean, you can look at the video when she comes back.

1950
02:46:49,093 --> 02:46:50,835
You know, I sent it to her, I can send it again.

1951
02:46:51,716 --> 02:46:54,839
And it's a short video, maybe 10, 15 seconds.

1952
02:46:55,519 --> 02:47:01,245
And you can see two or three cars coming down, and you can't see them until the last minute, or last second, really.

1953
02:47:06,078 --> 02:47:08,280
I like the idea of the 30 feet.

1954
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:17,068
That other corner, though, is such an odd radius that it's probably, I think that probably is contributing to it.

1955
02:47:17,108 --> 02:47:23,033
Not that we're going to change that sidewalk, but I mean, that may only be 20 feet, just a reminder sign.

1956
02:47:23,714 --> 02:47:26,817
No, they can park at the corner.

1957
02:47:28,762 --> 02:47:37,747
During ball games and things, they park around this corner here, where the cone is, and they stick out.

1958
02:47:38,187 --> 02:47:44,591
It's not too bad, but the thing is, you still can't see the crowds coming down from the Feldway to make a right turn.

1959
02:47:47,213 --> 02:47:52,015
Yeah, Chief, I'd almost say 25 feet on this side and maybe 35 on the other side.

1960
02:47:52,035 --> 02:47:58,219
I think 25 would get you to maybe the one pull over from the walkway to that house there.

1961
02:47:59,525 --> 02:47:59,825
Yeah.

1962
02:47:59,906 --> 02:48:10,641
You only have, we only have two seconds at the most to react when, when they're coming down from the Felsway and just trying to, we're trying to pull out.

1963
02:48:10,661 --> 02:48:12,804
Okay.

1964
02:48:14,748 --> 02:48:17,990
And thank you for presenting this and for the comments.

1965
02:48:18,030 --> 02:48:25,293
To the commissioners, any questions of the petitioner or of Director Blake, who's probably our expert in this area?

1966
02:48:26,173 --> 02:48:27,494
Just some clarifying stuff.

1967
02:48:27,534 --> 02:48:40,439
It sounds like this is a sight line issue making left and a right turn out of Maple Park onto Fulton, and it sounds like the primary obstruction is a car parked closest to the corner.

1968
02:48:41,651 --> 02:49:01,896
And it sounds like that, I'm just hearing from Todd and you folks, traffic sergeants, that a 30 foot as opposed to a 20 foot no parking zone between the sign and the corner would alleviate that obstruction and make the turn safer.

1969
02:49:01,916 --> 02:49:07,857
It would help and allow us to be able to see vehicles coming down.

1970
02:49:08,415 --> 02:49:10,119
Yep, yep.

1971
02:49:10,279 --> 02:49:12,704
Yeah, there are rules associated with this stuff.

1972
02:49:12,784 --> 02:49:19,257
Sight distance, there needs to be a certain amount of sight distance to have a safe turn with no control.

1973
02:49:21,524 --> 02:49:25,565
This is an uncontrolled intersection, so we need to have the sight distances.

1974
02:49:27,286 --> 02:49:28,886
What's the problem on the other side?

1975
02:49:30,087 --> 02:49:31,727
I don't understand the other side of the large radius.

1976
02:49:31,747 --> 02:49:35,088
The other side is, first of all, they're all doing a game or something.

1977
02:49:35,108 --> 02:49:36,569
They all park on the curb.

1978
02:49:36,869 --> 02:49:37,849
Second of all, it's the same thing.

1979
02:49:37,869 --> 02:49:45,031
If you're going to make a right turn, you can't see the cars coming from the Felsway.

1980
02:49:45,071 --> 02:49:47,052
There's a rule that you can't park 20 feet

1981
02:49:49,348 --> 02:49:52,490
close to a rounding, is that correct, traffic sergeants?

1982
02:49:52,911 --> 02:49:54,172
But they do, they do.

1983
02:49:54,192 --> 02:50:05,962
I know, the question is for the sergeants because I'm wondering if that side is an enforcement issue and then the other side is a increased 20 to 30, which we would then want to have a sign there.

1984
02:50:08,043 --> 02:50:11,646
Anything you could do would be fine with me.

1985
02:50:13,708 --> 02:50:17,131
It's an option and then we could monitor and if it doesn't improve with enforcement, but sure.

1986
02:50:18,538 --> 02:50:23,965
And I'll move to install a 30 foot offset line from the rounding on Fulton street.

1987
02:50:23,985 --> 02:50:27,470
No parking to corner.

1988
02:50:29,798 --> 02:50:31,379
I'm sorry, Commissioner McGibbon.

1989
02:50:32,559 --> 02:50:34,920
Director Blank, was it 30 or 35 feet?

1990
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:36,541
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

1991
02:50:36,641 --> 02:50:42,083
When I was looking at it again, I was saying maybe that side needs to be longer, the other side needs to be less, so maybe 35.

1992
02:50:42,703 --> 02:50:48,686
I haven't measured it in the field, but looking at the situation, it looks to call for somewhere between 30 and 40.

1993
02:50:48,846 --> 02:50:51,427
I'm trying to be reasonable with the parking and everything as well.

1994
02:50:51,847 --> 02:50:53,108
let's do it this way.

1995
02:50:53,128 --> 02:51:01,873
I could make the motion to approve it, field located by you with the understanding that it's over 20.

1996
02:51:01,973 --> 02:51:04,355
So it's not just enforcement, it's something that needs to be signed.

1997
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:06,736
Yeah, that's perfectly fine, yeah.

1998
02:51:07,497 --> 02:51:08,697
All right, I'll make that motion.

1999
02:51:08,717 --> 02:51:12,920
So that would be the west, the northwest side.

2000
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:16,562
Yeah, northwest side of Fulton, north of Maple Park.

2001
02:51:17,303 --> 02:51:19,124
Northwest side, yeah.

2002
02:51:19,344 --> 02:51:20,685
And the video might help you.

2003
02:51:22,906 --> 02:51:24,127
Okay, and we'll take a look at that.

2004
02:51:24,147 --> 02:51:25,268
I'll be able to get that from Ms.

2005
02:51:25,328 --> 02:51:26,148
Erickson afterwards.

2006
02:51:27,089 --> 02:51:47,184
So Commissioner McGiven, would the motion sound something like on the motion of Commissioner McGiven to increase the no parking here to corner on the west side of Fulton Street north of Maple Park to greater than 20 feet at the recommendation of the Director of Parking and Transportation?

2007
02:51:48,285 --> 02:51:48,545
Correct.

2008
02:51:48,605 --> 02:51:50,467
Okay, do I have a second?

2009
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:53,530
Second.

2010
02:51:55,252 --> 02:51:57,594
Commissioner Brzezinski on a second.

2011
02:51:58,094 --> 02:51:59,695
Roll call vote, Seth.

2012
02:52:00,076 --> 02:52:01,176
Commissioner Brzezinski.

2013
02:52:03,178 --> 02:52:03,458
Yes.

2014
02:52:04,159 --> 02:52:04,819
Commissioner Hunt.

2015
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:05,920
Yes.

2016
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:07,201
Commissioner McGiven.

2017
02:52:07,822 --> 02:52:08,062
Yes.

2018
02:52:08,722 --> 02:52:09,763
Commissioner Velasquez.

2019
02:52:11,164 --> 02:52:11,385
Yes.

2020
02:52:12,273 --> 02:52:12,553
Chief.

2021
02:52:13,213 --> 02:52:15,654
Yes, five to nothing, the motion passes.

2022
02:52:17,375 --> 02:52:31,000
Sir, I appreciate your participation and what we're going to do is put that sign up on, as you're looking to the left side, the side closest to the Fulton, we're going to have our traffic engineer decide it's going to be greater than 20 feet.

2023
02:52:31,460 --> 02:52:35,041
And then on the far right side, we're going to do a little bit of enforcement.

2024
02:52:35,081 --> 02:52:39,703
Now, if that doesn't improve, we expect we'll hear from you anyway and we can adjust as we go forward.

2025
02:52:40,243 --> 02:52:41,564
Now, that'll take a little bit of time.

2026
02:52:41,584 --> 02:52:44,725
We have to order the signs, but it's been approved by the Traffic Commission.

2027
02:52:45,146 --> 02:52:52,990
And by late spring, summer, you'll have a sign in place and hopefully improve the safety for that area.

2028
02:52:54,010 --> 02:52:54,751
I appreciate it.

2029
02:52:55,051 --> 02:53:01,694
I don't want to be a pain and not let people across the street and the other building not park there.

2030
02:53:02,195 --> 02:53:06,737
But it's going to get worse with all the activity on Maple Park Ave.

2031
02:53:07,477 --> 02:53:11,178
have to make sure it's safe for them, too.

2032
02:53:11,338 --> 02:53:15,880
You may have saved a life here, sir, so thank you.

2033
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:17,681
I saved mine, probably.

2034
02:53:19,221 --> 02:53:20,922
All right.

2035
02:53:21,082 --> 02:53:24,123
Thank you for your participation.

2036
02:53:24,143 --> 02:53:31,266
2024-19, no parking here at the corner on Bradshaw Street, south side, a distance of 40 feet from Spring Street.

2037
02:53:31,286 --> 02:53:33,187
Director Blake.

2038
02:53:48,177 --> 02:53:48,785
You're muted, Todd.

2039
02:53:53,335 --> 02:53:54,816
Sorry, similar situation.

2040
02:53:55,516 --> 02:54:03,400
Because it's tight two-way street parking on both sides of Bradshaw at the throat of Spring Street, it's just recommended to eliminate the parking up to this first driveway here.

2041
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:06,722
So where my, if you could see that measurement there.

2042
02:54:07,042 --> 02:54:08,963
So it's roughly 40 feet from the intersection.

2043
02:54:08,983 --> 02:54:15,566
So if someone parks there right now, it can be really challenging for people going in and out of Spring to Bradshaw and vice versa.

2044
02:54:15,586 --> 02:54:20,289
So it creates a little safety issue there by eliminating that one spot, which is,

2045
02:54:21,153 --> 02:54:25,916
Maybe not even technically a spot once you factor in the 20 and the three foot rule from the driveway.

2046
02:54:26,537 --> 02:54:28,338
So it's marginal at best anyways.

2047
02:54:28,438 --> 02:54:32,401
So if we just formally restrict that.

2048
02:54:34,323 --> 02:54:35,463
It's this right here.

2049
02:54:37,245 --> 02:54:41,368
People are actually squeezing between that driveway and the stop sign.

2050
02:54:42,497 --> 02:54:43,357
Correct, yeah.

2051
02:54:43,437 --> 02:54:49,662
And then when people are trying to exit this two-way street, it kicks them over to the center and kind of makes it an unsafe situation.

2052
02:54:54,246 --> 02:54:56,047
This came up through resident inquiry.

2053
02:54:57,669 --> 02:55:00,771
By any chance, is it the resident of that house who's asking for it?

2054
02:55:01,111 --> 02:55:04,854
It looks like they... No, this is more about safety versus parking.

2055
02:55:04,894 --> 02:55:08,838
It was about challenging to get in and out without getting potentially hit head-on.

2056
02:55:09,717 --> 02:55:09,958
Right.

2057
02:55:10,359 --> 02:55:17,659
And obviously it's, well, if it's that person parking there, they have a very large driveway to park in.

2058
02:55:20,128 --> 02:55:22,290
To the commissioners, I just add one quick point.

2059
02:55:23,570 --> 02:55:31,995
It is on a corner, it is a crosswalk, and therefore it is already restricted 20 feet, but it's also restricted three feet and the other way from the driveway.

2060
02:55:32,136 --> 02:55:42,142
So, in theory, it looks like a really nice parking spot, but in practicality or by practice of the law, there's no place to park a car there.

2061
02:55:43,542 --> 02:55:51,226
A vote to put a sign up there, it's probably a foregone conclusion because I don't believe anyone could park there anyway, legally.

2062
02:55:51,826 --> 02:55:53,447
That's the Chief's opinion on that.

2063
02:55:53,947 --> 02:56:02,151
Well, I don't like putting up signs if it can be enforced anyway, but it would help communicate.

2064
02:56:02,292 --> 02:56:06,734
If we think it's going to help communicate, Todd, if we think that this is a recommendation from you, which I think it is.

2065
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:14,022
Other options would be to stripe it, but that doesn't really clearly indicate no parking.

2066
02:56:14,062 --> 02:56:17,583
So I'm always trying to figure out ways to have less signs.

2067
02:56:19,823 --> 02:56:20,464
Sometimes I needed.

2068
02:56:20,484 --> 02:56:26,845
Yeah, if we striped it, you could consider doing a short 10-foot double yellow to indicate a two-way street.

2069
02:56:27,185 --> 02:56:31,627
And then the distance between the yellow and the curve would be such that it might be obvious.

2070
02:56:32,087 --> 02:56:34,447
But it may not be obvious to people who have not parked there.

2071
02:56:34,467 --> 02:56:35,488
But we could try that as well.

2072
02:56:36,537 --> 02:56:38,978
Signs are clear, I mean, yeah.

2073
02:56:41,580 --> 02:56:47,803
Yeah, signs are clear and it's just, I think it's just a sort of, I don't want to call it an anomaly, but it looks like a pretty nice parking spot, right?

2074
02:56:48,624 --> 02:56:55,727
And I think people just kind of are not putting everything together as far as, you know, what would legal, because it can fit there.

2075
02:56:55,767 --> 02:57:03,632
So a sign may be more reasonable to advise people, but I am also not against the paint.

2076
02:57:03,652 --> 02:57:05,993
So I'll leave it to the commissioners on however you want to

2077
02:57:06,843 --> 02:57:10,125
I don't know if that's something that we need to provide that for a motion.

2078
02:57:10,205 --> 02:57:12,646
I'm good with either or, but I do think it needs to be addressed.

2079
02:57:16,608 --> 02:57:18,548
Would we also be painting the curb?

2080
02:57:18,608 --> 02:57:23,471
I feel like I grew up with this idea that if the curb is yellow, you know you're not allowed to park there.

2081
02:57:30,733 --> 02:57:32,314
and whether that's worse?

2082
02:57:32,915 --> 02:57:34,596
Yeah, we don't paint curves in Everett.

2083
02:57:34,616 --> 02:57:36,017
And granite curves are tough.

2084
02:57:36,037 --> 02:57:38,399
That's more like California concrete curve.

2085
02:57:38,419 --> 02:57:41,382
They have a tendency to do red or green on the curves.

2086
02:57:41,682 --> 02:57:46,205
But this would be yellow in the street with a double yellow to indicate like two-way travel.

2087
02:57:46,225 --> 02:57:48,787
Oh, you're saying painting the street.

2088
02:57:49,488 --> 02:57:54,572
Painting the double yellow, and then it would indicate that it's a travel lane versus a parking space.

2089
02:57:54,732 --> 02:57:58,856
But if we just did the paint, it wouldn't need approval necessarily.

2090
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:06,445
if we do the no parking sign to make it, yeah.

2091
02:58:06,565 --> 02:58:15,393
I'll move approval for the sign because I think that's the clearest way to do this without putting paint down on a road that doesn't need paint.

2092
02:58:16,394 --> 02:58:17,956
Okay, then I'll second it.

2093
02:58:19,998 --> 02:58:22,020
On the motion of Commissioner McGiven,

2094
02:58:23,524 --> 02:58:30,846
on 2024-19, no parking here to corner on Bradshaw Street, south side, a distance of 40 feet from Spring Street.

2095
02:58:31,226 --> 02:58:32,706
Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

2096
02:58:33,406 --> 02:58:34,306
Roll call vote, Sergeant?

2097
02:58:34,586 --> 02:58:35,667
Commissioner Brzezinski?

2098
02:58:37,027 --> 02:58:37,287
Yes.

2099
02:58:38,227 --> 02:58:38,907
Commissioner Hunt?

2100
02:58:39,467 --> 02:58:39,827
Yes.

2101
02:58:40,408 --> 02:58:41,228
Commissioner McGiven?

2102
02:58:41,768 --> 02:58:42,028
Yes.

2103
02:58:42,848 --> 02:58:43,908
Commissioner Villescaz?

2104
02:58:46,409 --> 02:58:46,669
Yes.

2105
02:58:47,529 --> 02:58:47,729
Chief?

2106
02:58:48,409 --> 02:58:48,669
Yes.

2107
02:58:48,809 --> 02:58:50,090
A vote of five to nothing.

2108
02:58:50,130 --> 02:58:51,910
The motion is approved.

2109
02:58:53,242 --> 02:59:00,007
2024-20, bike lanes, Grove Street from Winchester Line to 70 feet north of Bustle Road.

2110
02:59:00,828 --> 02:59:01,489
Director Blake.

2111
02:59:09,975 --> 02:59:11,116
Sorry, can you see that?

2112
02:59:12,017 --> 02:59:12,637
We can, yes.

2113
02:59:13,058 --> 02:59:20,123
Okay, so it's just from the Winchester Line, which is just north of the northern end of the U-shaped street Norwich Circle.

2114
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:28,004
down by the cemetery, all the way down to the bridge, or just north of the bridge in Bustle Road.

2115
02:59:28,604 --> 02:59:32,726
It's a stretch of Grove Street that currently has no parking either side anyways.

2116
02:59:33,147 --> 02:59:36,028
So it's unlike other parts of this meeting tonight.

2117
02:59:36,749 --> 02:59:39,690
It does not take away any parking whatsoever from the community.

2118
02:59:40,131 --> 02:59:41,792
It's just a matter of striping lines.

2119
02:59:42,392 --> 02:59:45,934
So currently, this is an aerial of the situation here.

2120
02:59:46,514 --> 02:59:48,336
And then this kind of gives you a sense of what's there now.

2121
02:59:49,156 --> 02:59:50,476
There's a yellow line in the middle of the street.

2122
02:59:50,776 --> 02:59:54,597
It's essentially a 15-foot travel lane from the yellow to the curb in each direction.

2123
02:59:54,617 --> 02:59:56,478
It doesn't need to be 15 feet.

2124
02:59:57,098 --> 03:00:01,859
We have enough space to do a five-foot minimum bike lane in each direction, which would be 10-foot travel lanes.

2125
03:00:02,899 --> 03:00:05,460
And then it would provide bicycle accommodation.

2126
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:11,561
And at the same time, we believe traffic calm the road as well, because when it's a wide traveling like that, people tend to speed more.

2127
03:00:11,961 --> 03:00:17,883
So by having a 10-foot travel lane versus a 15-foot traveling, it might occur some slower speeds on the street, we hope.

2128
03:00:18,563 --> 03:00:21,787
But it would add to the bicycle infrastructure in the city.

2129
03:00:25,451 --> 03:00:25,891
I love it.

2130
03:00:26,392 --> 03:00:28,214
Is there anybody from the public to speak on it?

2131
03:00:28,234 --> 03:00:28,995
Because I love it.

2132
03:00:33,238 --> 03:00:39,203
I want to put a commissioners first, but I do have a question.

2133
03:00:39,283 --> 03:00:40,344
Are we losing any parking?

2134
03:00:40,384 --> 03:00:41,925
You may have said that.

2135
03:00:42,146 --> 03:00:43,086
Zero parking loss.

2136
03:00:43,106 --> 03:00:46,990
There's no parking on either side of that section of growth existing.

2137
03:00:47,010 --> 03:00:48,431
So there's no change.

2138
03:00:52,112 --> 03:00:55,753
So this is from Todd North of Brussels to the Winchester line.

2139
03:00:56,053 --> 03:01:05,575
And we're going to communicate with Winchester and let them know what we're doing so that, you know, if it gets approved so that they could potentially continue on Winchester, just like they did on Winthrop Street when we did that.

2140
03:01:06,775 --> 03:01:08,815
Right now it looks like they have shoulders painted.

2141
03:01:08,835 --> 03:01:10,976
I don't think we have shoulders painted, correct?

2142
03:01:11,636 --> 03:01:12,776
Yeah, I don't believe so.

2143
03:01:12,796 --> 03:01:15,557
They have like one, one or two, like a two foot edge line.

2144
03:01:15,577 --> 03:01:15,777
Yeah.

2145
03:01:15,817 --> 03:01:16,677
We have nothing.

2146
03:01:16,717 --> 03:01:16,977
Yeah.

2147
03:01:18,077 --> 03:01:21,098
So when we did Winthrop Street, they followed suit and got their,

2148
03:01:21,941 --> 03:01:27,405
got into gear and then continued the bike lanes into Winchester to try to provide a more cohesive network for everyone.

2149
03:01:28,766 --> 03:01:31,928
Looks like they got 11 or 12 foot lanes too, probably 12 foot.

2150
03:01:32,529 --> 03:01:38,413
Yeah, I measure at least where it meets up and they do have the space, yeah, but

2151
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:47,506
It looks like when I was doing street view that there was a car parked in the shoulder, in the travel lane.

2152
03:01:48,767 --> 03:01:51,249
Do we see that happening in Medford?

2153
03:01:51,289 --> 03:01:53,391
I feel like Medford's more narrow.

2154
03:01:54,892 --> 03:01:58,275
When I've been at, this is the street, I'm correct, right?

2155
03:01:58,355 --> 03:02:00,537
It's the entrance to the Brooks Estate up there, right?

2156
03:02:00,557 --> 03:02:01,758
Yeah.

2157
03:02:03,299 --> 03:02:07,062
I've never seen anybody try and park on the street, but I'm not there very often.

2158
03:02:11,092 --> 03:02:15,812
And it would be nice if people could feel that they had bike lanes leading up to the Brooks Estate.

2159
03:02:19,870 --> 03:02:32,295
So I'll share this because it looks like that Seinfeld Kramer type episode where there's a luxury, like a wide lane for people to start speeding when you travel from Winchester into Medford.

2160
03:02:33,155 --> 03:02:37,997
It would narrow that and it would be, ours would be more narrow than the Winchester side.

2161
03:02:38,057 --> 03:02:48,581
Anyway, to bring some uniformity, some definition, it wouldn't seem like a raceway anymore while at the same time providing valuable bicycle infrastructure.

2162
03:02:51,707 --> 03:02:52,968
have a hand up.

2163
03:02:52,988 --> 03:02:56,012
Commissioner Brzezinski do you have your hand up?

2164
03:02:56,512 --> 03:02:56,853
I do.

2165
03:02:57,393 --> 03:03:05,963
Todd are we going to have the normal paint on the ground denoting this is such a horrible high volume, high speed area.

2166
03:03:06,323 --> 03:03:10,228
I presume we're going to put nice markings on the ground to kind of denote what's happening.

2167
03:03:11,263 --> 03:03:40,035
in the area and then the second question is why are we stopping where you've delineated to stop is there just no need to take it forward any more than it is no i'd love to go south with it because there's no parking on either side of grove south of the bridge either up until maybe johnson but that southern portion of grove between johnson and the bridge is more narrow than that northern portion so it doesn't provide the width to do a bike lane each direction which we might be able to

2168
03:03:40,435 --> 03:03:41,736
to provide in one direction.

2169
03:03:43,037 --> 03:03:49,002
So once you cross over the bridge going south from Winchester to Medford, it gets more narrow.

2170
03:03:49,783 --> 03:03:58,630
So right now that upper section that we're proposing is 30 feet wide, so it enables us to do 10 foot travel lanes and five foot minimum bike lanes.

2171
03:03:59,050 --> 03:04:05,976
So they won't have the buffer like Winthrop Street, they'll just be a line, but very nicely painted line with the bike symbols and all that.

2172
03:04:06,096 --> 03:04:08,718
So it will be painted properly.

2173
03:04:10,829 --> 03:04:19,298
At the intersections of the street and the cross streets where you have the green demarcations like we see on winter street.

2174
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:25,745
In a perfect world, yes, but in our budget, probably not in this case.

2175
03:04:27,822 --> 03:04:28,022
No.

2176
03:04:28,763 --> 03:04:31,724
So it's very high end, high quality material to do that.

2177
03:04:32,104 --> 03:04:34,705
And it's an extra expense.

2178
03:04:34,745 --> 03:04:37,807
So we had a third party do winter street, right?

2179
03:04:38,447 --> 03:04:39,368
We were lucky to have that.

2180
03:04:40,308 --> 03:04:42,249
So we will, that's our goal.

2181
03:04:42,269 --> 03:04:50,693
We would strive for that, but I wouldn't want to promise the green across every side street and every bike lane we do just because of the added expense in our budget.

2182
03:04:50,974 --> 03:04:53,595
We barely have enough to do what we have striped now, so.

2183
03:04:55,284 --> 03:04:56,305
I agree with Alicia.

2184
03:04:56,325 --> 03:04:57,226
I like this idea.

2185
03:04:57,366 --> 03:05:04,212
It's just Grove Street is such a, again, it's such a very busy street and everybody's usually driving so incredibly fast.

2186
03:05:04,252 --> 03:05:10,177
And so just trying to figure out how we make people aware that, you know, there is a change in this area.

2187
03:05:11,578 --> 03:05:16,502
Yeah, depending on budget, we hope to add radar feedback signs in that area as well.

2188
03:05:17,824 --> 03:05:22,728
So it's an overall calming effect that we're trying to change the character of that section.

2189
03:05:25,853 --> 03:05:26,433
All right, thank you.

2190
03:05:28,074 --> 03:05:30,056
Any other commissioners, questions, comments?

2191
03:05:33,938 --> 03:05:37,680
Seeing none, anyone from the public have a question or comment?

2192
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:44,385
Okay, also seeing none.

2193
03:05:45,065 --> 03:05:47,687
There is one.

2194
03:05:48,027 --> 03:05:48,507
Welcome.

2195
03:05:48,527 --> 03:05:49,748
We're going to ask you to unmute.

2196
03:05:52,755 --> 03:05:55,417
Welcome, it's it's Leah, not Peter.

2197
03:05:55,437 --> 03:05:57,479
We literally just joined.

2198
03:05:57,499 --> 03:06:00,321
I was wondering if we could look where the plans are.

2199
03:06:00,681 --> 03:06:01,522
How do we look at them?

2200
03:06:01,542 --> 03:06:04,184
Yeah, can you put them right back up?

2201
03:06:05,284 --> 03:06:09,668
Yeah, what we had presented was a concept plan.

2202
03:06:09,728 --> 03:06:12,910
So that's not the actual engineer plan that we'll use to strike it with.

2203
03:06:13,330 --> 03:06:15,212
But let's see.

2204
03:06:29,755 --> 03:06:46,400
So it's from the Winchester line down to, past the cemetery down to roughly Bustle Road, because that's the stretch of road or grove that's wide enough to accommodate it.

2205
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:48,660
South of there becomes too narrow.

2206
03:06:50,261 --> 03:06:58,143
So currently there's about 15 foot travel lanes, and it would become five foot minimum bike lane with 10 foot travel lanes in that segment there.

2207
03:06:59,687 --> 03:07:01,647
And so I think I saw.

2208
03:07:01,667 --> 03:07:03,808
Essentially, it looks something like this.

2209
03:07:03,888 --> 03:07:10,409
Obviously, it's a crude mock-up, but it's trying to get people to envision the wider pavement into a more narrow lane here.

2210
03:07:12,150 --> 03:07:18,191
So we have a one-way bike lane on both sides now?

2211
03:07:18,231 --> 03:07:20,631
Yeah, this would be both sides of the street, yeah.

2212
03:07:20,691 --> 03:07:20,731
OK.

2213
03:07:25,105 --> 03:07:29,430
So if the question was south of there, if we could continue the bike lanes.

2214
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:33,695
But Grove Street is more narrow south of there.

2215
03:07:33,735 --> 03:07:39,962
So we'd only be able to consider one direction if we further that further south.

2216
03:07:43,987 --> 03:07:45,108
Oh, we have to unmute them.

2217
03:07:46,934 --> 03:07:49,497
Sorry, you don't have to.

2218
03:07:50,398 --> 03:07:55,883
Keep yourself and you're going to sorry, I was trying to not let any background noise in.

2219
03:07:56,604 --> 03:07:59,447
I guess I think when we saw the.

2220
03:07:59,467 --> 03:08:05,252
Plans earlier, like, a couple of months ago at the commission, I remembered there being some protection.

2221
03:08:05,272 --> 03:08:06,734
What happened to that?

2222
03:08:09,178 --> 03:08:15,329
I couldn't recall if Amy had shown this to any folks at all or not.

2223
03:08:15,590 --> 03:08:18,275
I guess we saw one that Lily showed us.

2224
03:08:19,152 --> 03:08:24,733
Okay, because protection usually, well, that's also a cost and resource thing as well.

2225
03:08:25,434 --> 03:08:35,296
So, situations like Winthrop Street that have a buffer, we could put a flex post more permanently if we had the resources, you know, would potentially do that.

2226
03:08:35,376 --> 03:08:41,338
There's other considerations, other maintenance considerations, plowing and street sweep, and it's an ongoing discussion with DPW.

2227
03:08:42,118 --> 03:08:45,399
So I don't want to make any promises, but there's resource and other limitations.

2228
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:55,402
So in this particular case, when there's a single line and no buffer, there would be no space to provide flex posts that would be permanently there.

2229
03:08:55,502 --> 03:09:05,125
So yeah, there are definitely many more improvements that we want to do to bicycle infrastructure, but sometimes it's restricted to resources and other factors.

2230
03:09:05,505 --> 03:09:06,485
We get more length.

2231
03:09:07,695 --> 03:09:12,900
When we do less items in the cross section, so if we have less protection, like.

2232
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:16,583
We can have more distance more like the bike lanes.

2233
03:09:17,404 --> 03:09:20,146
So, with time, our budget should grow.

2234
03:09:20,166 --> 03:09:21,568
Uh, so just.

2235
03:09:25,093 --> 03:09:29,217
This is an incremental step, because I think everybody who rides bikes.

2236
03:09:30,257 --> 03:09:33,660
In the city, most cities want the full protection.

2237
03:09:34,301 --> 03:09:38,204
But there's just a step in the right direction, slow some cars down, make a dedicated lane for bicycles.

2238
03:09:38,845 --> 03:09:39,045
So.

2239
03:09:40,106 --> 03:09:41,047
Okay, 1st, small step.

2240
03:09:41,327 --> 03:09:42,008
Yeah, right.

2241
03:09:42,348 --> 03:09:46,792
Understand it's advocate for more funding for highway maintenance.

2242
03:09:47,496 --> 03:09:52,518
Yeah, I would I mean, I guess the 1 ask I'll make in the future is.

2243
03:09:53,378 --> 03:09:57,959
Todd, if we could, like, see some of these things in the commission.

2244
03:09:59,320 --> 03:10:01,980
Kind of in advance, I know that's something that used to happen.

2245
03:10:02,501 --> 03:10:05,061
I'll bet you're pretty busy, but, you know, if you can.

2246
03:10:05,802 --> 03:10:06,102
Thanks.

2247
03:10:06,642 --> 03:10:07,402
Yeah, definitely.

2248
03:10:10,183 --> 03:10:13,704
Here as well, thank you for your comments and participation.

2249
03:10:14,684 --> 03:10:16,765
Any other comments questions.

2250
03:10:19,038 --> 03:10:20,159
It's up to you.

2251
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:22,361
I'll move approval.

2252
03:10:23,162 --> 03:10:26,445
Second.

2253
03:10:26,966 --> 03:10:27,927
Second.

2254
03:10:27,967 --> 03:10:28,748
Give it to Steve.

2255
03:10:29,168 --> 03:10:32,451
Give the second to Steve.

2256
03:10:33,993 --> 03:10:35,534
Delayed response in this vehicle.

2257
03:10:36,615 --> 03:10:36,776
Right.

2258
03:10:38,437 --> 03:10:41,060
Punishment for my technical difficulties tonight.

2259
03:10:42,554 --> 03:10:53,782
On the motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve 2024-20, bike lanes, Grove Street from Winchester Lane to 70 feet north of Bustle Road, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

2260
03:10:53,802 --> 03:10:55,023
Roll call, Sergeant.

2261
03:10:55,564 --> 03:10:56,645
Commissioner Brzezinski.

2262
03:10:57,986 --> 03:10:58,366
Yes.

2263
03:10:59,027 --> 03:10:59,647
Commissioner Hunt.

2264
03:11:00,468 --> 03:11:00,728
Yes.

2265
03:11:01,268 --> 03:11:02,089
Commissioner McGibbon.

2266
03:11:03,050 --> 03:11:03,250
Yes.

2267
03:11:03,950 --> 03:11:04,951
Commissioner Velasca.

2268
03:11:06,853 --> 03:11:07,233
Yes.

2269
03:11:08,114 --> 03:11:08,314
Chief.

2270
03:11:10,270 --> 03:11:16,859
Since we're not losing any parking on me, yes.

2271
03:11:16,879 --> 03:11:22,287
2024-22 discussion of operating procedures of the traffic commission, including public notification requirements commissioned.

2272
03:11:24,548 --> 03:11:25,048
Thank you.

2273
03:11:25,208 --> 03:11:26,869
I wanted us to put this on here.

2274
03:11:27,029 --> 03:11:30,771
We talked a couple of times about the rules and regulations.

2275
03:11:31,311 --> 03:11:41,936
And I dug into it a little bit and realized that what's in the traffic rules and regulations has almost nothing that's about the operating of this board.

2276
03:11:42,536 --> 03:11:44,377
And so I did send around an email.

2277
03:11:44,417 --> 03:11:47,218
I apologize I didn't get to it till this afternoon.

2278
03:11:47,818 --> 03:12:09,693
around lunchtime today, sort of a statement about that for background, that many of our boards and commissions have a document that is considered how the organization is operated, what the positions are, like is there a clerk, is there a vice chair, what are those roles, what's the role of the staff, how often does the board meet?

2279
03:12:10,633 --> 03:12:15,997
And I think that this body would really benefit from having something like that.

2280
03:12:17,057 --> 03:12:21,280
And I sent around the one that is being used by the CD board.

2281
03:12:21,820 --> 03:12:27,743
And I will say I staff the CD board, technically my staff do, but I had nothing to do with writing this.

2282
03:12:27,823 --> 03:12:34,107
This was actually some of the members of the board who are lawyers and are on other organizations.

2283
03:12:34,947 --> 03:12:58,706
came up with this structure and I think it would be benefit to us and that a second step would then be then to identify the types of items that come into this board and we might then say let's list those out and then have a document that lists what are the things that people might be applying for, what is the process for doing that and then what are our guidelines and policies in writing

2284
03:12:59,196 --> 03:13:17,056
of notification for different kinds of things, as I do feel like sometimes staff Todd brings us changes, and he goes, this one I know you guys want a notification I guess you would want it so I did the notification, and sometimes he brings it we're like oh you should have notified and sometimes we have other things and we're like well.

2285
03:13:17,697 --> 03:13:24,305
So my proposal this evening is that everybody take a look at the rules and regulations.

2286
03:13:24,385 --> 03:13:25,506
It's called rules and regulations.

2287
03:13:25,547 --> 03:13:30,633
It's rules of the Medford Community Development Board governing organization and procedure.

2288
03:13:32,535 --> 03:13:40,019
And what it does is it references the acts that established the CD board and then these operating policies of it.

2289
03:13:40,520 --> 03:13:49,144
I did look at the traffic commission rules and regulations and there are three paragraphs that speak to the operating of this body in there.

2290
03:13:53,082 --> 03:14:03,026
One of them is a paragraph that says that petitions, complaints, and requests for studies should be in writing and addressed to the Traffic Commission Police Headquarters Medford.

2291
03:14:03,486 --> 03:14:06,427
Such petitions should be signed by one or more interested persons.

2292
03:14:07,107 --> 03:14:09,728
That exists as a statement, that's a fine statement.

2293
03:14:10,188 --> 03:14:14,690
The other two paragraphs are actually lifted directly from the acts of 1958 which create this body.

2294
03:14:16,630 --> 03:14:23,897
And I'm going with the assumption that we're not changing anything that's in the acts of 1958, that's an act of the legislature, so I'm not proposing that.

2295
03:14:24,557 --> 03:14:40,372
I'm simply suggesting that we should vote tonight, that we should take a look at these operating procedures separate and independent of the traffic rules and regulations for the city of Medford and move these forward.

2296
03:14:40,992 --> 03:14:44,216
and that the traffic rules and regulations need to be updated.

2297
03:14:44,997 --> 03:14:47,140
And I'm trying to separate the two of these things.

2298
03:14:51,626 --> 03:14:56,092
Okay, so for clarification, are you asking us to review it or vote on it tonight?

2299
03:14:56,663 --> 03:15:13,631
So what we would, in theory, what we would vote is that yes, we would like somebody, and we'll need to delegate who is that somebody, to come back with a draft, like I wasn't about to prepare draft rules and regulations of this board if the rest of you were gonna say forget it.

2300
03:15:15,311 --> 03:15:18,293
I keep saying rules and regs, but it's operating procedures.

2301
03:15:19,171 --> 03:15:33,864
And my goal is not to change things with the creation of it, but to write down what we're doing, so that we might then decide to change things once we have it in writing, so we can all look at the same thing.

2302
03:15:33,884 --> 03:15:37,568
Okay.

2303
03:15:38,288 --> 03:15:40,030
And do you have a time frame?

2304
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:43,173
And the reason I ask that is I have

2305
03:15:45,310 --> 03:15:49,311
attempted this in the past, so I would say that I'm maybe 50% done.

2306
03:15:50,471 --> 03:15:53,912
I have to just find some time to do it, so I would volunteer.

2307
03:15:55,712 --> 03:16:00,473
Or you can send me what you have, and then I could take it the next step.

2308
03:16:01,973 --> 03:16:06,114
Because I'm not talking about that 80-page document, right?

2309
03:16:06,134 --> 03:16:06,494
Correct.

2310
03:16:06,514 --> 03:16:07,775
I just want to be very clear.

2311
03:16:08,035 --> 03:16:09,415
That's not what I'm discussing.

2312
03:16:10,875 --> 03:16:14,236
But there's portions of that that actually address some of this, so that's good.

2313
03:16:20,728 --> 03:16:21,689
I just don't know how to proceed.

2314
03:16:21,729 --> 03:16:25,674
I think, I agree we should do this, at least from my perspective.

2315
03:16:26,555 --> 03:16:31,802
I'm just trying to think what sort of, well, let me ask the other commissioners what your thoughts are while I kind of ponder.

2316
03:16:33,784 --> 03:16:40,232
I think someone needs to create a draft and then we can talk about the draft and then send it back for final.

2317
03:16:43,999 --> 03:16:45,160
Yeah, I agree.

2318
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:53,788
I hate to pawn it off on the people with the most experience, but I think the people with the most experience would be the better ones to take a first crack at it.

2319
03:16:55,550 --> 03:17:03,277
And I guess if I was doing it from scratch, I would take the CD board ones and edit them to make it look like the traffic commission.

2320
03:17:04,838 --> 03:17:08,261
Alternatively, I could take what you have and merge it into this.

2321
03:17:11,477 --> 03:17:15,381
rather than just starting, I could never write something like this from a blank piece of paper.

2322
03:17:17,343 --> 03:17:24,971
Can I suggest that if we do this, debating if I really want to say what I will say.

2323
03:17:29,315 --> 03:17:34,501
Once we're prepared that we hold a special traffic commission just to discuss that,

2324
03:17:35,650 --> 03:17:37,191
It would have to be public, of course, right?

2325
03:17:37,211 --> 03:17:42,155
But it would be the only issue on the agenda to kind of iron out those issues.

2326
03:17:43,276 --> 03:17:56,628
Right, because technically, as a public body, like if this was some other organization that wasn't regulated by open meeting law, I'd say, why don't I make a draft and I'll circulate it and we can all make edits on it.

2327
03:17:57,368 --> 03:18:01,192
Technically, that's not allowed, although I would check.

2328
03:18:02,624 --> 03:18:05,826
Operating rules may not be covered by open meeting law.

2329
03:18:06,967 --> 03:18:10,209
Like if we were scheduling, we could doodle poll offline, right?

2330
03:18:10,589 --> 03:18:11,189
That's legal.

2331
03:18:11,209 --> 03:18:21,476
Because we're not- We couldn't discuss them and we'd have to vote on them in a public setting.

2332
03:18:22,656 --> 03:18:22,816
Right.

2333
03:18:22,916 --> 03:18:31,822
Alicia, could you not post them in the public forum and then we all just go out there and grab them down and make comments on them?

2334
03:18:34,746 --> 03:18:43,431
So instead of emailing it to us, you could... Well, for example, the chair could send individually to each member just a copy of what is worked on.

2335
03:18:43,932 --> 03:18:50,656
And then when we hold a, as I suggested, special public, then we could discuss them openly.

2336
03:18:51,236 --> 03:18:51,516
Right.

2337
03:18:51,616 --> 03:18:53,217
You'd have it in advance, in other words.

2338
03:18:54,578 --> 03:18:54,798
Yeah.

2339
03:18:56,920 --> 03:18:57,540
And that would work.

2340
03:18:58,000 --> 03:18:58,781
I think that would be fine.

2341
03:18:58,841 --> 03:19:03,664
I think it would be good because it would be this first step towards, I think, improving the processes.

2342
03:19:05,024 --> 03:19:12,206
I'm not so sure we need a vote on this, but what I suggest is that I'll kind of gather up what I have, send it to you, you can kind of do the merge document.

2343
03:19:12,246 --> 03:19:27,591
When you're done, you can individually send it to the commissioners and then we can say we're going to hold a special meeting of the Traffic Commission to discuss these operating procedures and just get it done.

2344
03:19:27,691 --> 03:19:29,651
I don't hear a commissioner saying they're against this, right?

2345
03:19:29,711 --> 03:19:31,672
I mean, we don't have anyone saying that this is

2346
03:19:32,552 --> 03:19:34,234
It could not so good idea.

2347
03:19:34,274 --> 03:19:35,875
I think we all think it should be done.

2348
03:19:36,515 --> 03:19:39,918
But am I wrong to assume that we don't need a vote on this?

2349
03:19:40,659 --> 03:19:41,960
It's just kind of.

2350
03:19:43,982 --> 03:19:44,422
Doesn't matter.

2351
03:19:44,442 --> 03:19:51,448
I don't think we need to the vote could come at a time later on if.

2352
03:19:52,069 --> 03:19:55,332
A draft comes up, you know, we could we could vote it down.

2353
03:19:56,753 --> 03:19:58,114
But I don't think there's anything to vote on now.

2354
03:19:58,154 --> 03:19:59,095
There's nothing of substance.

2355
03:19:59,555 --> 03:19:59,655
No.

2356
03:20:00,632 --> 03:20:06,315
Any vote would be to just move forward with making edits or drafting a document.

2357
03:20:07,156 --> 03:20:09,017
Yeah, and I don't think we need to approve that.

2358
03:20:09,037 --> 03:20:10,217
I think that could just happen.

2359
03:20:11,198 --> 03:20:11,438
All right.

2360
03:20:12,318 --> 03:20:14,179
Do we want to continue it for three months?

2361
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:15,500
No.

2362
03:20:16,440 --> 03:20:19,362
Yeah, because we'll put it on a special agenda at that time.

2363
03:20:19,422 --> 03:20:23,004
That creates a whole other thing of having to pull it off a table, et cetera.

2364
03:20:23,024 --> 03:20:23,524
Let's just go.

2365
03:20:23,744 --> 03:20:24,985
We have a plan.

2366
03:20:25,325 --> 03:20:26,326
It calls for a discussion.

2367
03:20:26,366 --> 03:20:27,126
We had a discussion.

2368
03:20:27,146 --> 03:20:29,427
We give up a plan, and we move forward.

2369
03:20:30,903 --> 03:20:32,004
I just mark it as resolved.

2370
03:20:35,387 --> 03:20:40,892
All right, we comfortable with that one?

2371
03:20:40,972 --> 03:20:41,753
Yep, I am.

2372
03:20:41,773 --> 03:20:42,013
2024-23.

2373
03:20:42,093 --> 03:20:46,056
Clarification of the Traffic Commission agenda item 2022-21.

2374
03:20:46,096 --> 03:20:50,400
Visitor passes for Yale Street for Lincoln Kennedy Condo Residence.

2375
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:51,141
Commissioner Hunt.

2376
03:20:52,092 --> 03:21:05,599
Right, it came to my attention that we had voted on this in 2022, authorizing passes for Lincoln Kennedy, it came to my attention that the parking office was denying the visitor passes.

2377
03:21:06,580 --> 03:21:12,943
And I asked internally in City Hall, whether this was something that could be handled in city internally.

2378
03:21:13,583 --> 03:21:20,507
And it sounded like it needed to actually come back to the Traffic Commission to clarify what we meant.

2379
03:21:21,668 --> 03:21:21,768
And

2380
03:21:22,338 --> 03:21:25,340
Jim, you can tell me if I am misspeaking on any of that.

2381
03:21:28,103 --> 03:21:33,347
No, Alicia, I think there was the clarity that was necessary to be able to issue these passes.

2382
03:21:34,728 --> 03:21:41,013
And what the variance said is two visitor passes per resident for Yale Street.

2383
03:21:43,755 --> 03:21:50,220
So we just needed some clarity on that, whereas the resident parking itself is limited to 10 residents.

2384
03:21:51,970 --> 03:22:08,155
So the variance for Lincoln Kennedy for residents to get parking says that only up to 10 residents can get parking permits because they do have a parking lot, right?

2385
03:22:10,016 --> 03:22:20,239
And it was my understanding that the visitors passes did not need to be associated with, like you didn't have to get a resident permit parking in order to get the visitors pass.

2386
03:22:23,134 --> 03:22:31,862
That is a gray area because the 2011, which limited the resident parking to 10, was somewhat different than the May of 2022.

2387
03:22:32,302 --> 03:22:42,191
And again, it's sort of open-ended, and I think that was just the concern of parking, and I think that just needs to have some clarity.

2388
03:22:44,961 --> 03:22:54,490
So that's why I put this on here, that the residents who over the last couple of years were getting the visitor parking permit, went to the parking office and we're told no.

2389
03:22:54,510 --> 03:23:01,757
And it's from my perspective, it's

2390
03:23:04,037 --> 03:23:12,159
Had a long term plan to allow this and the traffic commission 2022 reinforced that, but we've always had this agreement about 10.

2391
03:23:13,480 --> 03:23:14,520
Visitor passes, right?

2392
03:23:14,540 --> 03:23:19,021
So 10 residents eligible visitor passes and in 2022.

2393
03:23:19,741 --> 03:23:22,102
For however, they are written up, I don't think it changed.

2394
03:23:23,002 --> 03:23:35,294
right and I don't think that was ever intended to change what that process was and I can see how that someone from the parking department may want that sort of clarified and clear and put in writing somewhere so there's no question of a future.

2395
03:23:36,996 --> 03:23:42,381
That being said, I think things have changed since 2022 in that area.

2396
03:23:48,283 --> 03:24:11,170
The, a lot of this was, this is specifically related to the residents of the Lincoln-Kennedy Condo Association, deals that were agreed upon many years ago, and it's just that, like anything else, they weren't formally, you know, written down, and now we're trying to clear them up, and we spent some time, but a couple of months ago,

2397
03:24:12,533 --> 03:24:19,539
We turned Harvard Street from Main Street to Winchester Street into a resident permit parking street.

2398
03:24:21,941 --> 03:24:27,986
The residents of the Lincoln-Kennedy Condo Association are residents of Harvard Street.

2399
03:24:30,548 --> 03:24:35,993
I think, therefore, very clearly and plainly, they are entitled to resident permit parking passes.

2400
03:24:37,585 --> 03:24:41,347
or Hobbit Street as residents, they get all that comes with that.

2401
03:24:42,127 --> 03:24:46,530
I don't see how this traffic commission could make an argument against that.

2402
03:24:46,730 --> 03:24:56,895
Now, I get it, this is kind of flipping this thing over for we're talking about Yale Street, but back then in 2022 even, Hobbit Street was not a resident permit parking street.

2403
03:24:57,075 --> 03:24:57,956
It is now.

2404
03:24:59,036 --> 03:25:01,878
And because Hobbit Street is a resident permit parking,

2405
03:25:02,807 --> 03:25:08,233
The residents of the Lincoln County Condo Associations already have resident parking rights.

2406
03:25:09,975 --> 03:25:12,318
And so I'm not sure we need a variance for anything.

2407
03:25:12,458 --> 03:25:19,586
Now, I'm sure, and I know Anne is on board, there may be some that say, no, wait, we want to park on Yale Street.

2408
03:25:20,475 --> 03:25:25,098
That's a totally different argument now that we have a new rule in place several months ago.

2409
03:25:25,739 --> 03:25:27,860
We have resident permit parking on Harvard Street.

2410
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:29,201
They're residents of Harvard Street.

2411
03:25:29,801 --> 03:25:30,402
They're entitled.

2412
03:25:31,242 --> 03:25:38,707
We wouldn't grant any other street a variance to park on another street simply because they wanted to, because we sort of controlled this.

2413
03:25:39,628 --> 03:25:43,871
Having said all of this, what is the impact of the vote earlier tonight?

2414
03:25:44,838 --> 03:25:46,399
On the zone now, I get it.

2415
03:25:46,419 --> 03:25:48,200
This is going to be kind of a couple of months later.

2416
03:25:48,240 --> 03:25:48,400
Right?

2417
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:50,542
So it's almost all irrelevant.

2418
03:25:50,662 --> 03:25:50,862
Right.

2419
03:25:52,843 --> 03:25:57,206
And I hope that kind of made sense because it's just going back and forth, but.

2420
03:25:58,447 --> 03:26:00,248
If they are in the zone, right?

2421
03:26:00,288 --> 03:26:01,489
This new zone that we created.

2422
03:26:02,029 --> 03:26:02,349
Correct.

2423
03:26:04,430 --> 03:26:08,113
Yep, so their residents within the zone, they can park.

2424
03:26:09,503 --> 03:26:11,965
anywhere they want if they get a resident permit parking sticker.

2425
03:26:12,785 --> 03:26:21,530
Separate from that, they're currently residents of Harvard Street and have a resident permit, the right to resident permit parking on Harvard Street.

2426
03:26:23,571 --> 03:26:26,193
I don't know if we have to entertain variances anymore.

2427
03:26:26,393 --> 03:26:27,914
So I throw that out for food for thought.

2428
03:26:28,014 --> 03:26:29,755
The rules have changed over the last couple of months.

2429
03:26:32,797 --> 03:26:34,078
Did I confuse it or help it?

2430
03:26:34,098 --> 03:26:37,660
A little of this, a little of that.

2431
03:26:41,449 --> 03:26:41,769
I will.

2432
03:26:42,169 --> 03:26:42,409
I will.

2433
03:26:43,770 --> 03:26:44,630
I apologize.

2434
03:26:44,650 --> 03:26:51,131
I will say I believe it is this part of the equation and clarity is the visitor pass program.

2435
03:26:51,792 --> 03:26:53,652
And I think that is the issue.

2436
03:26:54,532 --> 03:27:01,034
It's not being visitor passes are not being issued for Yale Street because there's no clarity as to what they are.

2437
03:27:01,074 --> 03:27:09,516
But I think what you're saying, Chief, is we generally have visitor parking on the street that is issued on.

2438
03:27:09,716 --> 03:27:10,296
Am I correct?

2439
03:27:11,067 --> 03:27:11,247
Correct.

2440
03:27:11,267 --> 03:27:20,876
Okay, so they would be entitled, they're entitled to the full powers of parking that any other resident on a resident permit parking sticker.

2441
03:27:22,577 --> 03:27:25,400
Resident permit and two visitor passes.

2442
03:27:26,761 --> 03:27:33,907
When we do variances, we restrict most times the visitor permit parking.

2443
03:27:35,289 --> 03:27:35,569
Here,

2444
03:27:36,383 --> 03:27:44,286
Like, I don't know why, I mean, we have dealt with variances with corner homes for different reasons, or there's just certainly no parking there.

2445
03:27:44,627 --> 03:27:54,011
And I get it, Harvard Street isn't a whole lot of parking, but there aren't a whole lot of residents of the 215 Harvard Street who are actually taking advantage of this.

2446
03:27:54,051 --> 03:27:57,332
So I don't see historically that this would change things.

2447
03:27:59,233 --> 03:28:03,495
I also think that this becomes a moot point in a couple of months

2448
03:28:05,073 --> 03:28:06,995
when we are in a zone park.

2449
03:28:07,796 --> 03:28:25,997
But the zone parking, so if I can channel what I think the objection is going to be, and then if we want to table it because we've been here for almost four hours, so it's hard to make an intelligent decision after four hours of a meeting, let alone on top of an eight-hour workday, is that

2450
03:28:27,846 --> 03:28:35,732
They would say that there's not very much parking on Harvard, and where they are is the end of the allowed parking.

2451
03:28:35,832 --> 03:28:36,813
It's very narrow.

2452
03:28:37,113 --> 03:28:42,977
They want to be able to park on Yale Street, which is safer and wider, and their building stretches between the two.

2453
03:28:43,718 --> 03:28:49,262
Unlike most people who would have to go to another street, you just exit the other end of the building.

2454
03:28:49,782 --> 03:28:58,124
They would say that's why they want the visitor permits are only allowed still even under the new zone, only on the street you live on.

2455
03:28:58,564 --> 03:29:03,345
So they'll only be allowed to get visitor permit parks parking on Harvard.

2456
03:29:05,745 --> 03:29:07,186
I don't know that we need to finish this.

2457
03:29:07,266 --> 03:29:09,806
I realize that Anne is on here.

2458
03:29:09,866 --> 03:29:10,847
She's raising her hand.

2459
03:29:11,007 --> 03:29:13,787
She had indicated that she was unable to attend this evening.

2460
03:29:14,167 --> 03:29:15,988
And could we table this to another night?

2461
03:29:17,912 --> 03:29:21,875
I thought it was a simple clarification, but it sounds like it's even more complicated.

2462
03:29:21,895 --> 03:29:30,742
I am somewhat mildly concerned that they're unable to get visitor passes in the meantime, but it's a visitor passes and they have a lot.

2463
03:29:30,842 --> 03:29:33,664
And there's a work around, even though they don't like it.

2464
03:29:33,985 --> 03:29:36,126
And they do live right next to a public parking lot.

2465
03:29:36,426 --> 03:29:40,430
Like literally, right next to a public parking lot.

2466
03:29:40,750 --> 03:29:44,693
So there's work around in the short term if we wanna think about this one some more.

2467
03:29:45,693 --> 03:29:55,004
Yeah, and I don't disagree, but I want to hear from, uh, but I just want to make sure that the commission is have their comments for us as we historically do.

2468
03:29:55,765 --> 03:29:56,386
But if you're.

2469
03:29:57,127 --> 03:29:58,829
If if anyone has any other questions.

2470
03:30:00,932 --> 03:30:04,897
Well, that we can hear from the resident 1st and see what their thoughts are on this whole process.

2471
03:30:06,850 --> 03:30:15,795
I would just like to say that I agree with your point, Chief, about the Harvard Street rejurisdiction that exists now, that didn't exist before.

2472
03:30:17,296 --> 03:30:18,697
So that's a strong point.

2473
03:30:19,938 --> 03:30:35,727
It's interesting that, you know, I mean, I don't think when we did all this that we considered that, you know, this specific situation, but we did make 215 Harvard Street a part of a resident permit parking program of Harvard Street, just

2474
03:30:37,218 --> 03:30:43,901
By by rules, but also, like, we're changing the process in a couple of months, right?

2475
03:30:44,101 --> 03:30:45,242
They're going to get his own pocket.

2476
03:30:45,282 --> 03:30:47,063
They're going to be eligible to do that.

2477
03:30:47,163 --> 03:30:52,885
And I don't know in the zone pocket tickets if they're part of a resident private pocket that we have the right to deny them.

2478
03:30:54,366 --> 03:30:55,006
This is the best.

2479
03:30:57,087 --> 03:30:57,948
Oh, um.

2480
03:30:59,902 --> 03:31:00,422
It's interesting.

2481
03:31:02,063 --> 03:31:04,745
So if there's no further comment, I'd like to hear from the resident.

2482
03:31:04,765 --> 03:31:04,905
Ms.

2483
03:31:04,965 --> 03:31:06,426
Fretz, welcome.

2484
03:31:06,586 --> 03:31:07,987
Thank you for being patient.

2485
03:31:08,107 --> 03:31:11,610
I hope all is well and that you're doing fine today.

2486
03:31:11,670 --> 03:31:13,731
But I think you've heard everything we've said.

2487
03:31:13,791 --> 03:31:14,732
What are your thoughts?

2488
03:31:15,392 --> 03:31:16,593
We're just going to ask you to unmute.

2489
03:31:31,211 --> 03:31:32,392
And are you able to unmute?

2490
03:31:35,913 --> 03:31:38,755
If you're not, just type into the chat so we know.

2491
03:31:51,681 --> 03:31:57,985
No, she did state that she was having some sort of, so she may not be able to.

2492
03:31:58,245 --> 03:31:59,945
She did log off and log back on.

2493
03:32:02,562 --> 03:32:04,043
Or it could be Larry too.

2494
03:32:12,726 --> 03:32:18,209
Anne, can you type a message just to let us know that you are there working on an issue?

2495
03:32:35,319 --> 03:32:36,060
This is interesting.

2496
03:32:40,843 --> 03:32:59,215
Well, while she's working on this and if she is able to, you know, unmute this in the course of resolve the technical difficulties, I believe what Commissioner Hunter's suggestion is that, you know, can we just kind of put this aside and take a deeper look into it in the meantime?

2497
03:32:59,275 --> 03:33:01,216
And I don't think that will hurt

2498
03:33:03,332 --> 03:33:03,512
Ms.

2499
03:33:03,532 --> 03:33:09,577
Fretz's status as of right now, and I don't think things will change anything really quickly if we did that.

2500
03:33:10,078 --> 03:33:14,041
I am hoping that in the next few minutes while I talk, she's able to log in.

2501
03:33:14,101 --> 03:33:17,424
But if she's not, it's the only other issue we have on the table.

2502
03:33:17,564 --> 03:33:22,028
And so I would suggest that we do something, we do table this event.

2503
03:33:22,048 --> 03:33:22,268
Oh, Anne?

2504
03:33:22,288 --> 03:33:22,788
You hear us?

2505
03:33:22,808 --> 03:33:23,569
No.

2506
03:33:23,749 --> 03:33:23,969
Yes.

2507
03:33:30,562 --> 03:33:31,904
Yeah, can you hear me?

2508
03:33:32,424 --> 03:33:33,326
We can hear you now.

2509
03:33:33,446 --> 03:33:33,866
Perfect.

2510
03:33:34,647 --> 03:33:34,928
Great.

2511
03:33:38,827 --> 03:33:44,632
I'm so sorry, it's me on medication and yeah, that doesn't always help.

2512
03:33:45,132 --> 03:33:54,159
Just very quickly, we need the parking passes for Yale Street visitor parking passes in order to be able to service the Lincoln building.

2513
03:33:54,500 --> 03:33:59,384
We can't service it from Harvard Street because there's no parking on our side of the street.

2514
03:33:59,744 --> 03:34:00,645
And as Alicia said,

2515
03:34:01,145 --> 03:34:05,809
The secondary issue is that there's limited parking on Harvard Street.

2516
03:34:06,109 --> 03:34:14,035
We have all the cars that are parked on the sidewalk, and if you drive down the street at night, there's issues, and it's not a safe street to park on.

2517
03:34:15,036 --> 03:34:20,139
We do have the Yale Street parking lot, but that doesn't accommodate visitors.

2518
03:34:21,391 --> 03:34:34,276
or the visitors that would be there for overnights or a week long visit, which would be able to be accommodated on Yale Street as opposed to just being relegated to Harvard Street.

2519
03:34:34,876 --> 03:34:40,238
I don't have an issue with being in the zone that changes the whole perspective.

2520
03:34:40,839 --> 03:34:48,602
But the question is, how do we accommodate people who are coming to visit and we are stuffed to the gills with

2521
03:34:49,962 --> 03:34:52,805
cars parking here in the lot.

2522
03:34:52,825 --> 03:35:03,415
We do have our own lot, but we also have, as I wrote in one of the emails I wrote to the gentleman yesterday, is that we have multiple three-bedroom units

2523
03:35:06,218 --> 03:35:12,103
where they're full, sometimes with as many as six people, and I don't know where they put their cars.

2524
03:35:12,563 --> 03:35:21,510
We have one bedroom unit, an affordable unit, that has five people living in it with three cars, and they only have two parking spaces.

2525
03:35:21,910 --> 03:35:24,612
We can't use our visitor parking spaces for trucks.

2526
03:35:25,033 --> 03:35:33,019
We can't use them for long-term overnight guests, like if you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend that stays over.

2527
03:35:33,419 --> 03:35:35,381
So we do need visitor parking passes.

2528
03:35:36,081 --> 03:35:59,677
The question arises for you, could we continue to use, actually we don't have any anymore, Yale Street visitor parking passes in order to be able to provide our landscapers, plumbers, and all the people that service the Lincoln Building from that side of the building, and other people as well?

2529
03:36:01,700 --> 03:36:09,626
Okay, thank you very much for at least clarifying the position of the residents there.

2530
03:36:10,387 --> 03:36:24,938
I have another thought, and even though I'm the one who kind of pushed this question forward, and this is to the commissioners to kind of think about, the flip side is the reality is in two months, like if we are, if this GL zone goes in at two months,

2531
03:36:26,074 --> 03:36:43,683
Is there a harm, and I know I'm contradicting myself, in just restating what we've done for the last year, for this calendar year, that it's 10 residents are eligible for the visitor passes.

2532
03:36:44,723 --> 03:36:50,606
I know it's an odd little rule, and we continue what we've been doing.

2533
03:36:50,706 --> 03:36:51,427
Yes, Anne, go ahead.

2534
03:36:52,144 --> 03:36:56,126
We've only had use of five in the past three years.

2535
03:36:56,906 --> 03:36:57,527
Two years, rather.

2536
03:36:58,047 --> 03:36:59,568
It's not being used too often, right?

2537
03:36:59,608 --> 03:36:59,888
Yes.

2538
03:37:00,068 --> 03:37:00,268
No.

2539
03:37:03,250 --> 03:37:13,735
I mean, to the commissioners, I understand that what I'm saying now is in direct contrast to what I just said, but it's almost irrelevant if the jail zone goes into effect July 1st.

2540
03:37:21,003 --> 03:37:28,588
Is it smarter to just say, let's reinforce what we've done in the past, get to July 1st and move on, or to change it again and again and again?

2541
03:37:29,148 --> 03:37:30,509
So I throw that back out to you.

2542
03:37:30,689 --> 03:37:31,870
I know I'm the one who's causing this.

2543
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:45,229
of chaos, but I think there's a set of rules that apply now that were different than in 2022, but we also voted tonight to change the whole makeup of it from July 1st.

2544
03:37:45,549 --> 03:37:46,830
Thoughts on that?

2545
03:37:47,550 --> 03:37:55,716
When we go to the G Zone and folks get visitor passes, is it just for the street or is it for the whole G Zone?

2546
03:37:56,937 --> 03:38:00,422
If I may speak on this, it's per street of issue.

2547
03:38:00,922 --> 03:38:08,252
So Yale Street residents can park anywhere in the G zone, for instance, but they can only apply the visitor pass for Yale Street.

2548
03:38:09,013 --> 03:38:09,153
Okay.

2549
03:38:12,085 --> 03:38:20,408
and we can have further discussion, but at least at that time, for the two or three residents who get visitor passes, they would be for Harvard Street.

2550
03:38:20,688 --> 03:38:22,269
And I mean, there's not that many.

2551
03:38:22,409 --> 03:38:26,071
Now, at that point, we may say, this is what you get.

2552
03:38:26,391 --> 03:38:29,352
Individually, you could come to the traffic commission for a variance.

2553
03:38:29,712 --> 03:38:31,132
We would entertain it differently then.

2554
03:38:31,212 --> 03:38:36,194
But I do think that should be some of the conversations we have after tonight's meeting.

2555
03:38:36,294 --> 03:38:39,696
But it's really just a question of how do we preserve

2556
03:38:41,123 --> 03:38:45,648
How do we preserve rights of those residents between now and July 1st?

2557
03:38:46,188 --> 03:38:47,330
And we can do it two ways.

2558
03:38:47,910 --> 03:39:00,244
Tell them that they're entitled, by rule, to a resident permit parking sticker on Harvard Street with two visitor passes, or reinforce what we had voted on in 2022, which is

2559
03:39:04,407 --> 03:39:12,552
and we're not going to be able to get up to 10 visitor passes up to 10 visitor passes or 10 residents, but these are passes of Hill Street and get us to July 1st where it all changes.

2560
03:39:13,573 --> 03:39:14,514
It it doesn't.

2561
03:39:15,995 --> 03:39:19,177
Help the fact that we need visitor passes in order to

2562
03:39:27,785 --> 03:39:33,246
like a repair vehicle type, like the plumber or so to serve, HVAC or somebody.

2563
03:39:34,206 --> 03:39:36,787
Cranes, landscapers, et cetera.

2564
03:39:39,307 --> 03:39:41,027
And it's coming into that season right now.

2565
03:39:41,047 --> 03:39:49,329
I will say I don't understand why Cranes Landscaper can't park across the street and walk his equipment across the street.

2566
03:39:49,729 --> 03:39:51,669
I see them all over the city.

2567
03:39:52,309 --> 03:39:55,250
How would they get the barge milk

2568
03:39:56,130 --> 03:39:59,352
from the other side of the street or another parking lot.

2569
03:39:59,452 --> 03:40:00,652
It adds to their life.

2570
03:40:00,872 --> 03:40:09,216
We have a whole 100-yard stretch of use that needs, I'm sorry, park mulch, and they bring it in from that side.

2571
03:40:09,236 --> 03:40:15,339
Ian, not to be contrarian, but don't you have visitor parking spots in the property where they could park?

2572
03:40:17,380 --> 03:40:19,521
If they're servicing a different part of the area?

2573
03:40:19,962 --> 03:40:21,402
I mean, it's a three-acre property.

2574
03:40:22,023 --> 03:40:24,664
I mean, look, we can't

2575
03:40:27,012 --> 03:40:34,175
We can be accommodating and then there's, I mean, that's a private piece of property.

2576
03:40:34,195 --> 03:40:41,657
The city is not really required or entitled to give every little assistance to a private piece of property.

2577
03:40:42,078 --> 03:40:52,301
We can be helpful in accommodating, but that problem there is a reason I think I would vote to change things when you could pull that vehicle right into your own property and service all you want.

2578
03:40:52,681 --> 03:40:54,782
If your landscapers have to go a little bit further,

2579
03:40:56,347 --> 03:40:59,250
I mean, come on chief, that's not really fair.

2580
03:40:59,670 --> 03:41:06,217
These guys work really hard and they have to pull the trucks up when they're cutting the grass.

2581
03:41:06,797 --> 03:41:14,565
I get it, it becomes hard work, but it doesn't become the obligation of the municipality to provide them with parking, contrary to our rules.

2582
03:41:19,229 --> 03:41:28,135
It's not a question of like being nice to the workers and we have to provide parking to a municipality and we have to do it appropriately.

2583
03:41:28,195 --> 03:41:33,259
And if you ask for that, every contractor in the city and the builder in the city is gonna.

2584
03:41:34,039 --> 03:41:44,807
So basically you're negating the agreement that we signed with the city that we would be able to park on Yale Street and park in the Yale Street lot

2585
03:41:45,815 --> 03:41:52,780
if we put the traffic gates up and maintain the traffic gates at our expense, you're basically wiping that out.

2586
03:41:53,901 --> 03:41:55,182
And that's what I'm getting back to.

2587
03:41:55,202 --> 03:42:04,269
And this was part of the reason why we asked for that so that we could totally service our building.

2588
03:42:05,269 --> 03:42:12,395
And servicing our building and making the guys work harder increases our costs because of time and effort and labor costs.

2589
03:42:13,535 --> 03:42:15,436
It's that simple.

2590
03:42:15,496 --> 03:42:28,201
We've talked about this agreement for years, and we've been very sort of understanding and accommodating, but I don't think this final agreement has ever been... It was a debate some, what, 2011, 2014?

2591
03:42:28,261 --> 03:42:30,281
It was conversations, none of us were around.

2592
03:42:31,182 --> 03:42:35,123
It was an agreement with the city that we would accommodate

2593
03:42:42,553 --> 03:42:48,226
blocking traffic getting through from Yale to Harvard Street by putting up the traffic gates.

2594
03:42:48,968 --> 03:42:51,253
And we would have rights to the Yale Street.

2595
03:42:53,731 --> 03:42:55,192
rights to park on Yale Street.

2596
03:42:55,752 --> 03:42:56,533
That's really interesting.

2597
03:42:56,573 --> 03:42:58,754
I don't know that we're going to be able to settle this tonight.

2598
03:43:01,555 --> 03:43:08,839
Honestly, I can't understand why the city would require a private company to do that, that set the discretion of the developer.

2599
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:12,061
We would never tell a developer to put up private gates.

2600
03:43:12,141 --> 03:43:15,923
I always assumed they were there for the benefit of the Lincoln County residents.

2601
03:43:16,463 --> 03:43:20,224
No, they're there for the benefit of the city because neighbors complained.

2602
03:43:20,564 --> 03:43:29,046
And I don't think that Luciano, Lorenzo rather, would want cars streaming through into his living room every night.

2603
03:43:29,586 --> 03:43:33,667
Or Dave Perella wants people driving next to his fence.

2604
03:43:34,007 --> 03:43:37,088
He doesn't like it as it is with people just cutting through the property.

2605
03:43:39,793 --> 03:43:44,795
Well, if there's an agreement, then can you give it to us so we can read it?

2606
03:43:44,875 --> 03:43:46,376
Chief's got a couple of copies.

2607
03:43:47,437 --> 03:43:50,678
It was signed by Mayor McGlynn.

2608
03:43:51,739 --> 03:43:53,099
It was executed through the city.

2609
03:43:53,840 --> 03:43:59,422
Mayor Burke tried to negate it and have us responsible for the Yale Street public parking lot.

2610
03:44:00,323 --> 03:44:09,027
This all came about because Mayor McGlynn wanted us responsible for the maintenance and snow removal in the Yale Street public parking lot.

2611
03:44:09,925 --> 03:44:11,866
That was part of the deal that I negotiated.

2612
03:44:12,926 --> 03:44:19,049
So Ann, the last time we talked about this, the document that was sent was, I forget your attorney's name, was it Harrington, Dan Harrington, was he?

2613
03:44:19,209 --> 03:44:34,155
Dan Harrington was the- We have a letter from him to the city making this suggestion offer, but we don't have- It was signed by Mayor McGlynn.

2614
03:44:34,195 --> 03:44:37,676
I have a copy of it, of the signature by Mayor McGlynn.

2615
03:44:37,917 --> 03:44:38,617
It was accepted.

2616
03:44:39,756 --> 03:44:40,258
We need that.

2617
03:44:41,603 --> 03:44:42,085
You have it.

2618
03:44:42,849 --> 03:44:43,792
It's on file.

2619
03:44:43,973 --> 03:44:44,676
I have not seen it.

2620
03:44:50,481 --> 03:45:01,467
If the chief has it or if you have it or Alba has it, it needs to make it to us as commission members so we can fully understand the issue and we can intelligently discuss it.

2621
03:45:02,567 --> 03:45:07,870
This apartment building is- It's a condominium.

2622
03:45:07,970 --> 03:45:08,770
Condominium, sorry.

2623
03:45:09,070 --> 03:45:11,332
This building has a parking lot.

2624
03:45:11,672 --> 03:45:16,634
Is the parking lot on the Benton Street side also part of this complex?

2625
03:45:17,415 --> 03:45:17,575
Yes.

2626
03:45:19,185 --> 03:45:22,406
So most buildings in the city do not have parking lots like this.

2627
03:45:22,806 --> 03:45:34,169
And typically, if there's private parking lots, the behavior of this commission since I've been on, if there are private parking lots, people don't get variances, people don't get extra things because they have private parking lots.

2628
03:45:34,689 --> 03:45:38,910
So I think we really need that agreement to make any sort of decision here.

2629
03:45:39,010 --> 03:45:41,691
So I'd like to table this until we can read that.

2630
03:45:43,471 --> 03:45:45,872
The chief has it, he's had it for two years now.

2631
03:45:47,439 --> 03:45:49,480
I believe he just indicated he has not seen it, Anne.

2632
03:45:50,320 --> 03:45:58,143
I don't have one with McGlynn's signature on it, but I will re-look, Anne, because we've had a few conversations over the past few years.

2633
03:46:00,224 --> 03:46:00,744
I'll take a look.

2634
03:46:00,824 --> 03:46:05,086
And we did just check with the legal department last week also to find it.

2635
03:46:06,707 --> 03:46:06,867
And?

2636
03:46:08,787 --> 03:46:10,128
And the legal department said?

2637
03:46:12,369 --> 03:46:13,809
We couldn't find the document.

2638
03:46:13,829 --> 03:46:15,290
I was looking for the document.

2639
03:46:16,760 --> 03:46:22,266
Okay, we'll get a copy, and I'll bring in Ron Lopez to the situation as well.

2640
03:46:23,047 --> 03:46:25,069
Okay, we don't need Ron, we just need the agreement.

2641
03:46:25,129 --> 03:46:30,775
If it's a black and white agreement signed by a mayor, we will do our best to honor that decision.

2642
03:46:30,815 --> 03:46:34,338
I do that all the time with PBW, so we just need the agreement.

2643
03:46:35,179 --> 03:46:35,360
Sure.

2644
03:46:35,998 --> 03:46:39,720
soon as I'm able to get around and get a copy of that.

2645
03:46:39,740 --> 03:46:45,223
Larry, that's- And I'll check anyway, I'll recheck the records anyway that threw myself into Alba.

2646
03:46:46,144 --> 03:46:50,986
You know that she's just gonna be, she's got a situation going on now too, so.

2647
03:46:51,567 --> 03:46:55,209
Yeah, and I appreciate that.

2648
03:46:55,369 --> 03:46:57,190
I did speak with her right afterwards.

2649
03:47:01,072 --> 03:47:03,053
Yeah, when he passed.

2650
03:47:03,765 --> 03:47:04,025
Yeah.

2651
03:47:04,585 --> 03:47:10,147
So we'll come up with a resolution to try to find the right way to do this.

2652
03:47:10,387 --> 03:47:26,453
I think the one thing that I would like to ask is that if it comes to we can't park on Yale Street, and that's your decision, and there's no legal way around it, that the

2653
03:47:28,408 --> 03:47:39,733
Management company or Larry Fretz has a variance that allows them to have two visitor parking passes for Yale Street in order to service the company here.

2654
03:47:46,013 --> 03:47:47,694
So we'll take that into consideration.

2655
03:47:47,754 --> 03:48:01,025
It sounds like we don't have to make these decisions tonight, and I don't know if you caught this part, Anne, but after four hours of a meeting on top of an eight-hour day, I'm having a hard time being creative or rational, so.

2656
03:48:01,765 --> 03:48:11,213
Well, I listened to the whole meeting waiting to see if we could get in early, but, and I'm pretty much incapacitated here, so I'm not on my game.

2657
03:48:11,853 --> 03:48:12,093
Yeah.

2658
03:48:13,482 --> 03:48:27,435
Tim, I will look for that as soon as I'm able to get up into my files, and I will contact Ron Lopez, because he negotiated the deal with Larry and I, and Dan Harrington, and then approached the mayor.

2659
03:48:28,055 --> 03:48:33,220
So I remember all of this stuff, which is why the only, this is the only reason why I'm involved in it.

2660
03:48:33,520 --> 03:48:35,662
Otherwise, they would just say, oh, we can't park there?

2661
03:48:36,103 --> 03:48:38,105
Sure, we'll just park in the Yale Street parking lot.

2662
03:48:39,138 --> 03:48:51,222
And as far as our parking lots, we have 50 condos, 100 parking spaces, everyone has two cars, and we have nine visitor parking spaces.

2663
03:48:51,582 --> 03:48:56,144
And those are often used by people on Harvard Street because they have no place to park.

2664
03:48:56,644 --> 03:48:58,864
We don't bother towing them anymore.

2665
03:48:59,305 --> 03:48:59,845
It's an emergency.

2666
03:48:59,865 --> 03:49:03,166
You've got way more parking than most people in Memphis, let's put it that way, way more.

2667
03:49:04,106 --> 03:49:07,767
Let's get the agreement and let's have an intelligent conversation about this, please.

2668
03:49:08,048 --> 03:49:08,868
We got to have the agreement.

2669
03:49:09,888 --> 03:49:11,269
Ron has it.

2670
03:49:13,590 --> 03:49:16,991
Should we be bringing our property manager in their legal department too?

2671
03:49:18,771 --> 03:49:20,992
I don't think it's necessarily needed, but you can do what you want.

2672
03:49:21,052 --> 03:49:27,054
I think we just need the black and white agreement signed by a mayor and signed by someone representing Lincoln Kennedy.

2673
03:49:28,935 --> 03:49:31,216
That was at the time was North Shore Development.

2674
03:49:32,403 --> 03:49:35,244
sure that we need to see that so we can discuss it.

2675
03:49:35,905 --> 03:49:36,105
Okay.

2676
03:49:36,845 --> 03:49:37,326
All right.

2677
03:49:37,366 --> 03:49:37,926
Get some rest.

2678
03:49:37,946 --> 03:49:39,527
Good luck with your recovery.

2679
03:49:39,787 --> 03:49:45,530
We'll talk on the motion of Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

2680
03:49:45,550 --> 03:49:46,850
The table was set up.

2681
03:49:46,870 --> 03:49:47,711
I'm sorry.

2682
03:49:47,731 --> 03:49:48,391
23-24-23 2024-23 roll call vote.

2683
03:49:48,411 --> 03:49:48,731
Sergeant.

2684
03:49:48,751 --> 03:49:51,333
Commissioner Brzezinski.

2685
03:49:51,353 --> 03:49:51,453
Yes.

2686
03:50:00,567 --> 03:50:01,247
Commissioner Hunt?

2687
03:50:01,808 --> 03:50:02,108
Yes.

2688
03:50:03,008 --> 03:50:03,928
Commissioner McGiven?

2689
03:50:04,589 --> 03:50:04,849
Yes.

2690
03:50:05,449 --> 03:50:06,569
Commissioner Velasca?

2691
03:50:08,650 --> 03:50:08,930
Yes.

2692
03:50:09,811 --> 03:50:10,091
Chief?

2693
03:50:10,851 --> 03:50:11,131
Yes.

2694
03:50:12,592 --> 03:50:14,853
That is everything, right?

2695
03:50:15,773 --> 03:50:16,433
Yeah.

2696
03:50:16,533 --> 03:50:23,036
It's amazing that I could go to a city council meeting and come back and still be a part of the traffic.

2697
03:50:24,637 --> 03:50:27,878
So I really appreciate all your hard work tonight, as usual.

2698
03:50:27,898 --> 03:50:30,219
There's some challenging things

2699
03:50:33,278 --> 03:50:34,219
You know, four hours.

2700
03:50:34,239 --> 03:50:36,460
Speak for themselves.

2701
03:50:36,800 --> 03:50:37,080
Yeah.

2702
03:50:37,781 --> 03:50:39,762
Yeah, we're breaking records that we don't need to break.

2703
03:50:40,983 --> 03:50:42,584
But I thank you all.

2704
03:50:42,604 --> 03:50:44,145
Thanks for your participation.

2705
03:50:45,106 --> 03:50:48,548
Steve, Patty, Jim, Tim, Alicia, thanks very, very much.

2706
03:50:49,549 --> 03:50:50,829
Go try to enjoy the rest of your night.

2707
03:50:52,250 --> 03:50:53,631
We'll do it again in a month or so.

2708
03:50:54,111 --> 03:50:54,972
On Jackson Drive.

2709
03:50:55,132 --> 03:50:56,433
I don't even know where it is anymore.

2710
03:50:56,913 --> 03:50:57,754
But thanks all.

2711
03:50:57,994 --> 03:50:58,534
Appreciate it.

2712
03:50:58,554 --> 03:50:59,535
All right.

2713
03:50:59,575 --> 03:51:00,035
Thanks, Shane.

2714
03:51:01,738 --> 03:51:02,579
Motion to adjourn.

2715
03:51:02,599 --> 03:51:03,261
Motion to adjourn.
