[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

41
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

42
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,450
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

44
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:53,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

45
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:27,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 22-074 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas the provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 44, Section 33A reads, Section 33A, salary provisions in budget requirements and limitations, Section 33A, the annual budget shall include some sufficient to pay the salaries of officers and employees fixed by law or by ordinance, notwithstanding any contrary provision of any city charter,

46
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:48,110
[SPEAKER_09]: No ordinance providing for any increase and increase in salaries or wages of municipal officers or employees shall be enacted except by a two thirds vote of the city council, nor unless it is to be operative for more than three months during the calendar year which is passed, no new position shall be created or increase in rates made by ordinance vote or appointment during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget.

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:03,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless provision therefore has been made by means of a supplemental appropriation, no ordinance vote or appointment creating a new position in any year in which a municipal election is held shall be valid and effective unless said ordinance vote or appointment is operative for more than three months during said municipal election.

48
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:15,396
[SPEAKER_09]: being so resolved that the City Solicitor render an opinion as to whether the City of Medford is in compliance with the aforementioned provisions of law in regards to the positions outlined in Council Papers 22-023 and 21-631.

49
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:22,938
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can indulge me for one moment, Councilor Knight, those items were tabled at last week's meeting pending an opinion of the City Solicitor.

50
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:28,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not believe this Council has received the opinion of the City Solicitor, so those items are still on the table, are still tabled.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

53
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:35,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week, this item came up and I did a fairly poor job at explaining it.

54
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:39,212
[SPEAKER_08]: We discussed ordinances and how ordinances are passed in this community.

55
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:44,798
[SPEAKER_08]: An ordinance requires four votes to be passed in this community unless it's statutorily required otherwise.

56
00:03:45,498 --> 00:04:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: and the confusion was raised last week based upon the fact that I feel as though we need an opinion as to whether or not this section of the general laws applies when it comes to creating positions via ordinance and giving pay raises via ordinance and whether or not a two-thirds vote is required or a simple majority.

57
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:12,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had preliminary discussions with the city solicitor, who's indicated that she's 90% sure that it would be requiring a two thirds vote to pass these provisions that are before us.

58
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we go further and get the solicitor's opinion.

59
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:25,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to say that last week, things got a little out of hand a little crazy in terms of parliamentary procedure and the like and it was not my intention to create any type of confusion, but rather to get clarification.

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:35,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I have speaking with the chair that, you know, it could have been perceived that I was trying to take a shot at the chair and that wasn't my intention at all.

61
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:38,887
[SPEAKER_08]: My intention was to move forward on the paper and move forward appropriately.

62
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,109
[SPEAKER_08]: As I've said in the past we've all taken an oath.

63
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:47,472
[SPEAKER_08]: We've taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the ordinances of this community.

64
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:51,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel as though that's a paramount responsibility for every one of us behind this rail.

65
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:57,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And when an issue like this comes up, when it comes to financial malfeasance or financial compliance, I feel as though it deserves strict scrutiny.

66
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,819
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I raised the issue this evening.

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,660
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I asked for the solicitor's opinion.

68
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I've become so passionate about these issues.

69
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,883
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a taxpayer dollars that we're discussing here.

70
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:08,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're discussing taxpayer dollars.

71
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,906
[SPEAKER_08]: of the utmost importance that we're complying with laws.

72
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:18,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, through the chair, it was not my intention to create confusion or to implement any delay tactics.

73
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:26,211
[SPEAKER_08]: What it was, was to create clarification to be sure that as we move forward, we do the right thing, we comply with the law, we get an opinion from the city solicitor.

74
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,652
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the rest of the term, we don't need to think about this stuff anymore.

75
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,654
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where this comes from, Mr. President.

76
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:37,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I again, ask the solicitor for an opinion as to whether or not these papers before us would require the two thirds of the simple majority

77
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,939
[SPEAKER_08]: and she's informed me that she'll be able to give us an opinion later on in the week.

78
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:52,747
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to approve this measure so it can officially be sent to her office for an official opinion back to the council, as opposed to an opinion to an individual Councilor who gave her the heads up because it was something I put on the agenda.

79
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:53,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

80
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

81
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:56,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

82
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:04,074
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, from the chair, just Councilor Knight, if you'd be willing to also make sure that

83
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:10,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you're asking for the opinion, are you asking me relative to the full section or just the two thirds vote.

84
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:16,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the paper speaks for itself, the clarification piece was whether or not the two thirds vote will comply, I mean ultimately.

85
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:22,117
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is, is the city of medford in compliance with the aforementioned provisions if we don't vote on it, then.

86
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't do anything so yeah we're in compliance right it's whether or not when we when we take the boat in the action now we need compliance right so i think that the question is um you know where the paper is put forward in a fashion that will comply with the financial requirements that are outlined in this in this question um and whether or not um we need four or five votes to pass the provisions that are before us

87
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:45,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

88
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:45,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

89
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:53,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason I asked is just that this, uh, this third clause here, uh, no ordinance voter appointment, creating a new position in any year in which a municipal election is held.

90
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, some of these papers were filed in a, in a election year.

91
00:06:55,838 --> 00:07:00,840
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, in addition to the two thirds of what I just want clarification on, on the election year provision as well.

92
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:04,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And from the chair, thank you for your clarification about proceedings last week.

93
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:05,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much appreciated.

94
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

95
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:10,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing personal at all on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

96
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:11,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

97
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

98
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello?

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

100
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Collins?

101
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:20,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

102
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:21,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

103
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

104
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:23,526
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli?

105
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:23,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

106
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:24,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Shang?

107
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:25,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

108
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,230
[SPEAKER_19]: President Morell?

109
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:26,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

110
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:29,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Harris?

111
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:29,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

112
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:30,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the affirmative, none in the negative.

113
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:31,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

114
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:46,067
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-075 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Council look into concerns dealing with delays with the structure being built at the corner of Lawrence Road and Forest Street, and if the interests of public safety and simple community standards are being followed.

115
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:51,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that a representative of the building department and the developer slash owner slash applicant for this permit

116
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:59,999
[SPEAKER_09]: present themselves before the city council committee of the whole to provide an update and to address the ongoing concerns of trash, dumpsters, debris, unkept property, and other matters.

117
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,684
[SPEAKER_09]: We have further resolved that the Medford Police Department notify the council if the department is aware of possible squatters living at that location.

118
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

119
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

120
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:16,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate residents that have reached out to me that had some concerns and wanted me to put this

121
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:21,516
[SPEAKER_02]: have gone by that property probably every day over the last three months.

122
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:28,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to the building commissioner this morning and the squatter situation has been taken care of.

123
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:34,387
[SPEAKER_02]: They make sure that they have regular police presence to make sure that doesn't happen again.

124
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:37,089
[SPEAKER_02]: That was happening, but now has been resolved.

125
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,215
[SPEAKER_02]: The project, as you can see, has now started back up prior to this being

126
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:45,475
[SPEAKER_02]: written.

127
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:47,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're now back to work.

128
00:08:48,036 --> 00:09:02,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe what I was told was the historical commission froze the permit because of some clerical or some changes that were made that weren't approved by their office that has since been approved and they've moved forward with that.

129
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:11,423
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the biggest piece that we see as much as we don't, we might not agree or like the

130
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:22,428
[SPEAKER_02]: the look of the building where it's higher and it's longer and it really takes away the look of the neighborhood for what was there prior.

131
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing we can do with the zoning that was in place that was approved.

132
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:37,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we can do is find a way to hold developers accountable for what's being done in our neighborhoods.

133
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:41,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, they have the position to go in and build

134
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,755
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as they follow the proper protocol and zoning requirements.

135
00:09:46,416 --> 00:10:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's still requirements that have to be maintained when it's dealing with neighbors and trash and possible dangerous situations with open areas, where there's construction equipment, where there are ladders, where there's

136
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,303
[SPEAKER_02]: a development that's not enclosed.

137
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:31,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing is for this developer, and they're not here today, so I won't bring up their name, but they've also done a few other jobs, developments in the community, where I've had complaints with what this company and this developer has done with the lack of

138
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood cohesiveness and understanding what the neighbors should be notified.

139
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:49,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't done that and they've been very rude and disrespectful and that's not the way we should do business.

140
00:10:49,799 --> 00:11:01,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, some of the concerns have been answered with no apparent

141
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:20,851
[SPEAKER_02]: punishment or halt of this project, but at the same time, we can ask for them to come to the city council and a committee, the whole meeting with the building department and this council that we start to look at drafting

142
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:31,217
[SPEAKER_02]: either policies or ordinances that would protect our neighbors when developers come into those neighborhoods and affect them in such a negative way.

143
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:35,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have a few neighbors that are here tonight that would like to speak.

144
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: If my colleagues don't have any other questions right now, I think that the neighbors words speak volumes.

145
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

146
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

147
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, President Morell.

148
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:11:52,588 --> 00:12:01,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli, so is the request that the developers come to that committee of the whole as well, or the committee of the whole is to address the topic?

150
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:07,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if our likelihood of being able to get them in there, and I don't want them to impede the process of advancing on this.

151
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I think it's twofold.

152
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can ask them, but they don't have to show up.

153
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:20,328
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've gathered, that we can request for them to come, but the likelihood of them showing up will be,

154
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:32,951
[SPEAKER_02]: would not happen, but I wouldn't mind getting this developer that's working in our community there to answer the questions for those neighbors.

155
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:48,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But moving forward, I think we should look down the line to put a committee together or a community whole meeting together to look at with the city solicitor and see what kind of, in the building department, to see what kind of rules or policies we can put in place that

156
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: that really haven't been followed by these developers as they're moving through metrics.

157
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that make sense?

158
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor- Yes, thank you for that clarification.

159
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,705
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of council, I have to approve, seconded by?

160
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:07,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

161
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor, we can still have public participation.

162
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more comments from fellow councilors?

163
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:19,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public would like to speak on this issue can approach the microphone or raise your hand on Zoom.

164
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me come forward.

165
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just provide your name and address for the record, please.

166
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, can I pull this down?

167
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:36,275
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Pat Ryan and I live at 156 Forest Street.

168
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm right next to the property that's in question.

169
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,437
[SPEAKER_15]: It's terrible what they've done.

170
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:48,431
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't adhere to any standards but their own.

171
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:59,722
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an unsafe work site and it blocks light in my yard, it blocks my son, it blocks everything.

172
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:02,084
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a monstrosity.

173
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:04,045
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably have seen it.

174
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,889
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have, it's on the corner of Forrest and Lawrence.

175
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, people,

176
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:15,045
[SPEAKER_15]: cars go through that intersection all the time.

177
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:21,154
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a very poor example of what Medford allows when they see that.

178
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:26,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Any?

179
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:27,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

180
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions, thoughts?

181
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions from fellow councilors?

182
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, Mr. President, if I can.

183
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are rats.

184
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:49,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I did talk to the building inspector that what we can do is we can request and amend this resolution that we have the building inspector go out and visit the site and give us even a weekly update so we can make sure that they're being held accountable.

185
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:52,247
[SPEAKER_15]: But the building inspectors can't be there all the time.

186
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,347
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to be sitting.

187
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Right there.

188
00:14:55,632 --> 00:15:00,587
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, but that's not their job, but we can't we can't do is we can have them go by even on a.

189
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, surprise visits.

190
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, throughout the week.

191
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:15,453
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just even if it's just a pop in so we can ask them if they can do that if we can amend that Mr. Clark, and I have their workers climbing around the roof, no safety.

192
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:20,336
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of questions about safety and OSHA and they fall on the rules.

193
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did talk to the building inspector and he's

194
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with this motion, hopefully he can come out there and if he sees that, he can stop that, you know, due to unsafe practices and stop that project.

195
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate bringing this forward and I'm sorry you're going through that.

196
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:48,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the sightline and unfortunately, the zoning in the area, he explained that it

197
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely it looks like a monstrosity.

198
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't belong.

199
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

200
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks more like a like an apartment building.

201
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:58,684
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like an apartment building from my back.

202
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

203
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize for that.

204
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:04,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, this legally, there's nothing we can do that I know as they move forward.

205
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So I this is this disheartening, disheartening piece of government when

206
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,713
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing else we can do.

207
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't, the developer doesn't care about, he cares about the bottom line.

208
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,315
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to get in and get out.

209
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:33,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but we can hold them accountable for the cleanliness, making sure that, you know, that they're providing safe conditions for employees and making sure that it's the cleanliness.

210
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there are rats there, that they're making sure that we can look at putting in some sort of

211
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: policy that they have to put an abatement process in for roads.

212
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Downsized the building.

213
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we asked this.

214
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:46,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing we can do.

215
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's that's that's tough.

216
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize for that.

217
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will get to the city city building inspector and hopefully they get out there tomorrow.

218
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

219
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,864
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hear from Mrs. Ryan, I'm sure.

220
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mrs. Ryan.

221
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:02,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comments from the public?

222
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:05,385
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one.

223
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:13,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you just say it into the microphone.

224
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:21,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Melanie Trinidad and I live at 116 forestry, and I just want to work off of that the only other thing, and I don't think differences they don't clear any snow removal.

225
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:25,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really dangerous intersection for walking.

226
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:29,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's a lot of bus stops there for kids.

227
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:31,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be the only thing I would add is they don't.

228
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.

229
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:41,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of the snow in front or on the side of that, of that particular we have an ordinance that that is certainly a violation of the city we're gonna add that to the, to the, to the.

230
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:42,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

231
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:42,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

232
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:44,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

233
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:49,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the text of the amendment.

234
00:17:51,802 --> 00:18:00,986
[SPEAKER_09]: the building commissioner or code enforcement officers cite the property for not following the snow and ice removal ordinance.

235
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:05,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

236
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:10,169
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

237
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

281
00:18:52,962 --> 00:19:14,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas Lawrence Memorial was graded as one of the 100 best hospitals in America, and number three overall in the state providing care for Medicare patients, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the staff and administration of Lawrence Memorial Hospital on their outstanding patient care, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite hospital staff and administration to a future council meeting for presentation of a council accommodation recognizing this achievement.

282
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:15,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

283
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:21,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much when we look at this, it's amazing to see that Lawrence Memorial Hospital got such great grades.

284
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:23,030
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at.

285
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:35,097
[SPEAKER_08]: The grading system of the 100 best hospitals in America looking at the way they provide care for Medicaid patients and seeing the Lawrence Memorial Hospital falls in the top three in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is great.

286
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we talk about Medicaid patients, who are those people?

287
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:45,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are people aged 65 and older or under age 65 and disabled or suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease or end stage renal failure.

288
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:47,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Individuals that are the most vulnerable in our community.

289
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's great to see Lawrence Memorial Hospital transitioning through a period of time where they were struggling and being able to move into a spot where

290
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: They're able to provide outstanding patient care and they're being recognized far and nationally.

291
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:15,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I might ask that this matter be approved by my council colleagues and that our friends at Lawrence Memorial Hospital be invited down to receive an official commendation commemorating this wonderful achievement that we also ask our state delegation to come down and join us in the celebration.

292
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:22,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we as residents of Metro take for granted how lucky we are to have a hospital and a university in our community.

293
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,849
[SPEAKER_08]: The hospital and the university both provide great, great assets to this community.

294
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:34,090
[SPEAKER_08]: They provide us with the ability to be stable during difficult times, and it's great to see the success continuing on at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

295
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,691
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

296
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Nai.

297
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:39,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

298
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mike.

299
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Nai, for bringing this forward.

300
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:47,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should celebrate this, but if you can help me out, the criteria, Councilor Nai,

301
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it classified as a hospital anymore?

302
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just healthcare?

303
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:55,078
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it defined?

304
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because it's curious.

305
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just because it doesn't have an emergency room doesn't mean it's not a hospital.

306
00:20:59,659 --> 00:20:59,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

307
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:00,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

308
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:06,720
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, New England Baptist is a hospital, but they don't have an emergency room.

309
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:11,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I think it's very similar around the level of care that they provide a hospital level services.

310
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:12,482
[SPEAKER_08]: They just don't have the emergency room.

311
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:13,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the clarity.

312
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:13,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

313
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

314
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:17,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

315
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:31,385
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think people know that Baltimore operates one of the finest geriatric psych units in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for people who are elderly and have psychological issues.

316
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:35,525
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think most people don't even know that it's even in there.

317
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:43,087
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think, let's see, that's one of the few that are still around and gets rave reviews.

318
00:21:43,574 --> 00:21:44,415
[SPEAKER_17]: for the work they do there.

319
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:48,719
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm sure that was probably some of the things that was provided.

320
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,083
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, you know, there's doctors in there, the surgical center seems to be doing well now.

321
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:56,226
[SPEAKER_17]: There's more doctors inside the building.

322
00:21:57,307 --> 00:22:02,952
[SPEAKER_17]: The urgent care facility is busy all the time, which is good.

323
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:05,194
[SPEAKER_17]: I use it myself.

324
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:16,461
[SPEAKER_17]: But then once you're in the emergency room, you're there for like days, you go in this, and the urgent care, and you're out there in 15 minutes, 20 minutes, with the same quality care that you're gonna get in the emergency room.

325
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:24,466
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I wanna thank Council Member for bringing this forward, and thank the hospital for, again, just because we don't have an emergency room, but a lot of patients in there.

326
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:29,849
[SPEAKER_17]: There are still a lot of patients in there, and it's still a hospital, and I'm glad they got the grade they did.

327
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

328
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

329
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:32,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

330
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:36,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just like to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda tonight.

331
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:43,804
[SPEAKER_01]: In my view, you know, there's no, there's no bad opportunity to thank and commend the healthcare workers in our midst, especially right here in our community.

332
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be our honor to commend them here in the council chambers.

333
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:48,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

334
00:22:50,588 --> 00:23:01,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Collins Councilor Tseng, um, I just wanted to echo the sentiments my fellow Councilors on this hospitals, you know, if you if you've grown up in Medford you've grown up with it around us.

335
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:06,130
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's, you know, been important to me my family.

336
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,673
[SPEAKER_16]: and important to our neighbors as well.

337
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:19,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's gone through changes, but I think this speaks to the strength of the hospital staff and the medical workers and the administration that we have there.

338
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,543
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm happy to support this and to recognize their achievement.

339
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:25,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

340
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:27,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comments?

341
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:34,812
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, just from the chair, I'd like to second everyone else's sentiments in that it may not be

342
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:40,970
[SPEAKER_09]: what we fought for in terms of keeping an emergency department, but they are still providing very high quality care.

343
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,393
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've heard very good things about their urgent care as well.

344
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:50,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So any further discussion, any discussion by members of the public?

345
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:55,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, you may come up to the rail and give your name and address for the record, please.

346
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:02,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening everybody.

347
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to mention that it got tricky.

348
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:15,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the new sign in regard to the definition of the hospital was in the middle for about six to eight months.

349
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:18,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just urgent care on the side sign.

350
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they said they couldn't put a hospital sign when we last spoke to that.

351
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:26,104
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget Sam's last name.

352
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:34,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, because you're supposed to have an emergency room, you have to be careful they did put the hospital sign up.

353
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:39,831
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're doing this for a real expedient reason, you really should check into it.

354
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:45,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not doubting Mr. Councilman nights word, but for Medicare payments.

355
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:47,175
[SPEAKER_11]: purposes.

356
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:51,559
[SPEAKER_11]: If it doesn't fulfill their definition of a hospital people will have a problem.

357
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:58,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's well worthwhile my phone call to call Sam or something to make sure that that sign is probably has been erected properly.

358
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:03,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well there are patients in there, there's probably a couple hundred patients in there still.

359
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:12,593
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not that there's nobody in there, they have the geriatric psych unit, and they have the regular psych unit, which is, you know, there's people in them.

360
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,515
[SPEAKER_11]: We're so proud of South 2.

361
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:19,398
[SPEAKER_11]: But according to Medicare definitions, you're supposed to have an ER.

362
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:20,999
[SPEAKER_11]: So it just may get tricky.

363
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,020
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not criticizing the structure or anything.

364
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I live three blocks from there.

365
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,022
[SPEAKER_11]: They've done a wonderful job.

366
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:29,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're so glad to have Urgent Care.

367
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:31,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been there twice myself.

368
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,088
[SPEAKER_11]: But if anyone in the audience is wondering,

369
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,230
[SPEAKER_11]: well, gee, I had a problem with my payment.

370
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really a hospital or not?

371
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:45,897
[SPEAKER_11]: According to Medicare definitions, you're supposed to have, by definition, an emergency room to pay for a hospital fare.

372
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So you just might wanna make a phone call to see him.

373
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

374
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

375
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Diaso.

376
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:52,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comments?

377
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:58,887
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

378
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:00,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

379
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:02,070
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended.

380
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:12,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

381
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:12,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

382
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:12,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

383
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:13,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

384
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:31,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears, yes 70 affirmative zero the negative emotion passes 22-077 offered by Councilor Knight.

385
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a result that the Medford City Council request special permit holder prestige car wash appear at a future science subcommittee meeting to discuss signage traffic flow and use of outdoor audio systems, audio system issues associated with operations Councilor.

386
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:48,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

387
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:53,066
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the car wash that was formerly known as Randy's on Middlesex Avenue.

388
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're a special permit holder relative to assign variants.

389
00:26:57,671 --> 00:27:02,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's going on in that parking lot is that there's been an inordinate amount of traffic gridlocking.

390
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:23,686
[SPEAKER_08]: noxious amount of noise acoustics loud music and the like being played over exterior PA systems and accidents in the parking lot that have warranted police involvement and submissions with the neighbors concerning access to their facilities and businesses that share the entrance and exit to that strip mall.

391
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:30,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So with this being said, I'm hoping that we can have these individuals from prestige car wash come in and sit before our subcommittee

392
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:37,955
[SPEAKER_08]: on signage to discuss some of the ways that we can improve the signage that we have out there to prevent gridwalking and to improve the flow of traffic.

393
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:41,679
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, maybe entrance only one way, exit only another way.

394
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Just some little low-hanging fruit ideas that we can improve what's going on in the neighborhood.

395
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:52,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they offer free vacuums this time of year especially, what happens is they have VIP membership and regular membership.

396
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:57,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're a VIP, what happens is just like getting on the plane at the airport, you get to cut the line.

397
00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:05,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could have people sitting in line, 15 minutes, then next in line, VIP comes in, goes right in front of them and goes to the vacuum.

398
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:11,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's happening is these people are sitting in queue for an inordinate amount of time, building up into the main drag and the thoroughfare and the like.

399
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:17,613
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm asking my council colleagues to support the resolution and see if we can do a little bit of work to provide some neighborhood relief.

400
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:19,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilman.

401
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

402
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilman, for bringing this forward.

403
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:27,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're working as a chair of the Subcommittee on Signs.

404
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:33,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on setting a meeting right now, but another concern.

405
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:41,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we could rectify that request and have them in.

406
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important we do that because it sounds like there's a public safety and public nuisance issue.

407
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

408
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:51,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I second the motion.

409
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:52,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

410
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:53,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion.

411
00:28:53,554 --> 00:28:58,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Discussion from members of the public.

412
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none on the motion of Council night seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

413
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

414
00:29:08,503 --> 00:29:08,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

415
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:08,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

416
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:09,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

417
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:09,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

418
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:10,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

419
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:10,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

420
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:10,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

421
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:18,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Bears.

422
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:25,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes 22-078 offered by Councilor curve yellow.

423
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:34,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a result of the Medford City Council allow the mayor to appropriate 2500 to help offset the legal costs associated with Chevalier auditorium battle with the encore casino.

424
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:37,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

425
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,578
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something we've been going through the last few weeks.

426
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,902
[SPEAKER_17]: As you see in the paper, your encore wants to build their

427
00:29:47,282 --> 00:30:06,305
[SPEAKER_17]: They're on entertainment center there and they've since cut down to 1000 seats and now if you saw the news tonight on course selling the property for 1.7 billion, and they'll just be renting be renters there, so I don't know if this is part of your plan to go around this again, but again you're wrong.

428
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:17,562
[SPEAKER_17]: We're fighting this battle over here and $2,500, it's not really a lot of money will help us to bloom right out.

429
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:25,427
[SPEAKER_17]: But if anybody was around over this weekend and Friday night, the square was packed, every restaurant in the city was packed.

430
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:31,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure we took in $2,500 in meals taxes just over this weekend with that one show.

431
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:32,872
[SPEAKER_17]: So that'll help to phrase it.

432
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:33,132
[SPEAKER_17]: But again,

433
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:43,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Until the commission makes a decision on this, and I think the whole decision rests on whether they build that bridge or not.

434
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:49,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Because as I say, if the bridge is there, in my opinion, it's part of the building, it's part of the casino.

435
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:54,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you'll never see anybody walking across the street in the middle of February to go see a show.

436
00:30:55,298 --> 00:31:07,946
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I think it's a, um, I would hope that my other Councilors support the $2,500 to help offset the legal costs, but, uh, you know, Constance Scott Perry has made the point in the past, you know, uh, we should be fighting harder on this and we're not.

437
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:11,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, but unfortunately, uh, we don't have a legal team.

438
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:16,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Our legal team is represented in Everett, which is a damn shame that this is happening.

439
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:19,813
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know, um, so it's,

440
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,822
[SPEAKER_17]: It's important going forward that one person doesn't serve two masters.

441
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:27,623
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what K.P.

442
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Lahr is doing, serving two masters.

443
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:33,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And they chose to serve Everett instead of serving Medford.

444
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:55,765
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, it's a small token to help move this forward, but I think going forward, the city is gonna have to figure out some kind of a better legal system than having somebody that serves all different cities and say, and this is the reason that we're in this predicament, because KP is all over the place.

445
00:31:55,785 --> 00:32:02,426
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would hope my fellow councilors support this, so we can at least help the Chevalier with their battle.

446
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:03,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

447
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:03,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

448
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:04,189

00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:23,083

00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

511
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:25,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:25,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:26,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

515
00:32:26,546 --> 00:32:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

516
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:26,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

517
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:27,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

518
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:27,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

519
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:27,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

520
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:28,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you

521
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:46,842
[SPEAKER_02]: just to beg the mayor and the administration to please find another firm that Medford has a standalone legal team or a city solicitor someone that's going to show that this is a true concern for our community.

522
00:32:47,503 --> 00:33:03,859
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do lose, if they do build this and we lose the most valuable piece in our community right now, especially in our downtown, which is the Chevalier and crippling that facility in any way will be devastating for this community.

523
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:16,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been all talking about the revitalization Method Square, redeveloping Method Square, and the biggest piece of that was surrounding it around the Chevalier and the shows that happened at Chevalier.

524
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:22,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finally getting past the pandemic issues that we can stop bringing in more shows on a regular basis.

525
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:33,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that Medford, the city of Medford, its own entity, stands up and files suit

526
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,785
[SPEAKER_02]: as its own entity, not as a partner with our vendor.

527
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to stand alone.

528
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:44,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll support the $2,500 because that is nothing.

529
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what, you know, I think it's more symbolic.

530
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:51,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, it's important, but I think more importantly,

531
00:33:53,656 --> 00:34:09,657
[SPEAKER_02]: We as a community we as a city as administration have to stand up and say that we are hiring this law firm to represent the city of Medford in this legal battle that is unjust and as as funny as you can, you can talk about.

532
00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what the neighborhood agreement that everybody agreed upon, they're finding ways to circumvent that.

533
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to hurt many communities.

534
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:21,083
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, it's going to hurt our community.

535
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:28,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we don't have someone at that table, representing the city of method as its own entity, then we're not really showing

536
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:39,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not showing the Gaming Commission, we're not showing Wynn, we're not showing Encore, we're not showing the city of Everett, that the city of Medford is willing to put a fight.

537
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we spent a lot of money on legal battles that we know we're gonna lose.

538
00:34:45,148 --> 00:35:00,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And this situation, we need to make sure that we beg the mayor to come to us with a paper if she needs to be, that we support any initiative that we have a standalone legal team fighting for this cause.

539
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:02,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

540
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:03,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.

541
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:05,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

542
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:07,663
[SPEAKER_08]: You wanna go?

543
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:08,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

544
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:10,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

545
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:15,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at this a little bit, because I think this is craziness.

546
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:21,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Shavire Auditorium, which is a city-owned asset.

547
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:29,221
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Bill Blumenreich Presents, which is a vendor that the city has contracted with after issuing an RFP.

548
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:36,487
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this individual in the last year of his contract,

549
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:47,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have what we've all stuck our chest out and pat ourselves on the back about the success of the Cheviro auditorium right.

550
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:52,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are, this console Scarpelli said the crown jewel of Method Square.

551
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:57,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're letting a vendor in the last year of his contract, take the lead.

552
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:07,645
[SPEAKER_08]: We're letting a vendor in the last year of his contract take the lead on the economic future and the economic stability of the crown jewel of our Tata district.

553
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:09,008
[SPEAKER_08]: This is insanity to me.

554
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,081
[SPEAKER_08]: This is absolute insanity to me.

555
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:13,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The man needs to make up her mind and take a position.

556
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Read the agreement.

557
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the agreement say if this bridge is being built, it will be in violation of the agreement?

558
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it is, get a lawyer and file suit.

559
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:26,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sick and tired of listening to, well, we have this law firm for this, and we have this law firm for that.

560
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:30,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hiring law firms all over the place, and we're not investing in homegrown talent.

561
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So anytime an issue like this comes up, where are we?

562
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:34,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting on our hands.

563
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,746
[SPEAKER_08]: looking for direction, looking for help, waiting for someone to bail us out.

564
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:43,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fair that Bill Blumenrecht, our vendor, is sitting here trying to bail us out of this gym.

565
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,109
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a city problem.

566
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:48,450
[SPEAKER_08]: The city should take leadership on it.

567
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,971
[SPEAKER_08]: 2,500, I have no problem voting for 2,500.

568
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:56,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give them the three hours of legal work at $800 an hour that they're gonna do for 2,500 bucks.

569
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The city should be driving the car.

570
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it last time and I'll say it again.

571
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,329
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a wait and see approach to sit on your hands.

572
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:10,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happens is, well, we tried and it failed, but it's not my fault, it's Bill Blumenreich's fault, he took the lead.

573
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Own the issue, be accountable, show leadership.

574
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:23,133
[SPEAKER_07]: This is supposed to be our crown jewel, our greatest achievement, Chevalier Auditorium, breathing life back into our downtowns.

575
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:26,057
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the way to defend it.

576
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:27,938
[SPEAKER_08]: This certainly isn't the way to grow it.

577
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:34,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And this certainly isn't the way to show a partnership with our vendor, who's invested a ton of money in making it successful down there.

578
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:35,924
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to take the lead.

579
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:38,205
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be the ones driving the ship.

580
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:43,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sick and tired of taking the wait and see approach, the lack of leadership, the follow the leader.

581
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,114
[SPEAKER_07]: On something like this, something as simple as this, well, we all know this is the best thing that's happened to Medford Square in 20 years.

582
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:54,545
[SPEAKER_07]: A measly $2,500, and we can't even get that?

583
00:37:55,727 --> 00:37:58,069
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have Brown, Rudnick, and Golston in stores.

584
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Farm retainer signed that filing suit right now.

585
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:09,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you for entertaining my rant, I did my best Councilor max impersonation there.

586
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting a little passionate about the issue.

587
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And I miss my friend daily.

588
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:20,459
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to the count my constant quality for bringing this measure forward, I will be supporting it this evening.

589
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:23,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Caraviello.

590
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:28,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I wholeheartedly support what's been said.

591
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:37,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is an existential threat to our downtown, which is so vital to our local economy.

592
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:42,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have one question that I'm sure Councilor Karavila could explain.

593
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:43,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I support this.

594
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to put that on the record.

595
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:47,878
[SPEAKER_16]: You mentioned some recent changes announced tonight.

596
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:53,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know if the bridge is still being built, how that would affect all of this?

597
00:38:55,675 --> 00:39:05,518
[SPEAKER_17]: On the news tonight, there was an announcement that Wynn is selling the property to a private investor and they will still operate the casino.

598
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:12,861
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how that affects or what they're going through their brain as far as the legality of this here.

599
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:16,942
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you watched the meeting last week on Thursday or you listened to it,

600
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:29,041
[SPEAKER_17]: The integral part of their plan is to build a bridge from one side of the street, so the people don't have to get cold and when they walk all the way back over to the casino.

601
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:35,029
[SPEAKER_17]: If that bridge connects the two buildings and as far as I'm concerned, that's the same building.

602
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:40,650
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we can play with the words that win LLC or win development, it's all win.

603
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:48,731
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, let's see how many people walk across the street from the casino in February to go see the show across the street.

604
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:49,611
[SPEAKER_17]: It won't be any.

605
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:53,512
[SPEAKER_17]: So as long as that bridge is there, as far as I'm concerned, it's part of the building.

606
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:58,293
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you watch the meeting, the gaming commission is assigning

607
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:02,214
[SPEAKER_17]: said that they'll decide to see our concerns.

608
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:06,555
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, that's, that's my opinion then I'll let you finish.

609
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:15,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was my main point but I do think it's important to make clear that we have to take the lead on our own economic situation in the city.

610
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,118
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need to show initiative, so I do support this.

611
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:20,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

612
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:20,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

613
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:27,474
[SPEAKER_17]: We shouldn't be fighting Bill's battle.

614
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:30,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, let's say Bill's a vendor for us.

615
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Laurel and Lynn, the city is the leader there.

616
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:39,226
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, we're the follower in this here.

617
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:47,253
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I say, you know, the past few years, this has been the savior of our downtown area and our restaurant business.

618
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Without them, half those places would have been closed by now.

619
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:55,020
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, yes, during the pandemic, there was anything, but again, you saw what it was like on Friday night.

620
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,201
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw what it was like the previous Friday night.

621
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,823
[SPEAKER_17]: The square was full of people.

622
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,044
[SPEAKER_17]: The restaurants were full.

623
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:01,165
[SPEAKER_17]: You couldn't get reservations.

624
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And it isn't just the downtown places.

625
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:06,169
[SPEAKER_17]: It goes to the whole area.

626
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody benefits from this.

627
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:15,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, so again, and I agree with Councilor and Councilor Scarpelli, that, you know, 2,500 is really a couple of miles worth of work.

628
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:23,384
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, until somebody steps up and takes the lead here, all we have is a bunch of followers and we shouldn't be fighting Bill's battle.

629
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:25,626
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say, it's our battle, not Bill's.

630
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:27,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

631
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:29,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from members of the council?

632
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:39,135
[SPEAKER_09]: One second, Andrew, just from the chair, I just wanted to add that I agree with the sentiments of the council.

633
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:40,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to note two things.

634
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:50,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, this is a request from the council for the mayor to spend these funds, whether to put forward an appropriation or to just spend the funds, which we believe that she has a discretion to do on her own.

635
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, I just wanted to note for the record,

636
00:41:55,509 --> 00:42:03,612
[SPEAKER_09]: that the council did receive a letter in support of this resolution from the Chevalier Commission and Acting Chairperson Mike Oliver.

637
00:42:04,972 --> 00:42:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if there's no further discussion from members of the council, I'll take members of the public.

638
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

639
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:17,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Council President.

640
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:23,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Methodist.

641
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:32,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to, I don't understand, through the chair, I'd like to ask Mr. Caraviello, I didn't see that news broadcast about, yeah, internet.

642
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:37,033
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so listen, my question is, you mentioned a figure.

643
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:44,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you say that the casino's selling the rental to a different entity for 1.7 billion or a million?

644
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:45,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Would it be?

645
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:50,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, must be a lot of land there.

646
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:56,787
[SPEAKER_13]: And like you implied, maybe it's an end around to do as they please.

647
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:07,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So my question is, the most important question I would think would be is, has this bridge to somewhere, nowhere, maybe somewhere in the future, has it been approved yet?

648
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:08,314
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

649
00:43:09,014 --> 00:43:15,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so who is the boss of that airspace over the busy Route 99 Broadway?

650
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,619
[SPEAKER_13]: The Gaming Commission will make that determination.

651
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:19,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Not the city of Everett where it's located?

652
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:25,602
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a state road, but again, but the gaming commission will determine if that's part of the casino.

653
00:43:27,123 --> 00:43:28,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So the state road is the state.

654
00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:31,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing to do with Everett as far as having authority.

655
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:35,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, who knows what's gonna happen in the state.

656
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:42,352
[SPEAKER_13]: The bigger these politicians are, the more you can count on the people taking it, you know where.

657
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:43,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck.

658
00:43:45,294 --> 00:43:46,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

659
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:49,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

660
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:53,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street.

661
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:53,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Cindy.

662
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:59,002
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to thank Rick for bringing this before the council.

663
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:11,788
[SPEAKER_00]: At about 8.45 Friday morning, I got an email from Brianna indicating that in order for it to be on tonight's city agenda, I needed to contact a city council member within an hour and a half.

664
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I had Rick's phone number.

665
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:15,469
[SPEAKER_00]: I called him right away.

666
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:16,930
[SPEAKER_00]: He got on the agenda this evening.

667
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:28,961
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is absolutely perplexing to me as everybody sort of has reiterated the fact that the Chevalier has been the economic engine for the city of Medford.

668
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:30,522
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.

669
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:33,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked with Bill since day one.

670
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:41,348
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to, believe it or not, Maple Park Association Room to meet with a small bunch from the Friends of Chevalier.

671
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:43,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the Friends, I'm also on the commission.

672
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:50,931
[SPEAKER_00]: People have worked extremely hard people in their 90s, years ago to rebuild the Chevalier.

673
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:53,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when this was proposed.

674
00:44:55,056 --> 00:45:01,099
[SPEAKER_00]: the encore coming in, I met with Robert DiSalvio to make sure that that would be no threat to us.

675
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,162
[SPEAKER_00]: He assured me that it would be terrific.

676
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:10,905
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, he was quoted as saying, there's gonna be a lot of enthusiasm, smiles, and passion.

677
00:45:11,565 --> 00:45:13,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he left after a four month tenure.

678
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,747
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now in the Catskills.

679
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So that agreement is obviously gone.

680
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:21,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill has agreed to put up $5,000 as you know, commissioned 2,500.

681
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:30,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And the city, as Adam has stated many times, it's a no-brainer.

682
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:33,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And George, I'm very pleased to hear that you've had a change of heart.

683
00:45:34,883 --> 00:45:47,246
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, I don't think that people know when their show is not sold out, Bill calls the friends, okay, and gives away countless tickets to residents of Medford.

684
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:53,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many people at the 99 low-income people have been able to enjoy shows

685
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:58,682
[SPEAKER_00]: cross section of Medford, never been able to afford to go in there.

686
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:03,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds and hundreds of tickets have been given away free because of his efforts.

687
00:46:04,148 --> 00:46:12,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, he's a businessman, but he's a friend he's also a huge, you know, philanthropic efforts to do whatever he can.

688
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:15,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's bent over backwards.

689
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:27,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I called what I call the Holy Trinity of the restaurants and let them all know that would be basically Carol's Salvatores and Mio Gusto who benefit the most from the Chevalier.

690
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just echo what everybody has said.

691
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:36,226
[SPEAKER_00]: We know when there's a show at the Chevalier, you can't get a seat.

692
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:41,086
[SPEAKER_00]: in the restaurants, an hour, an hour and a half wait, oftentimes.

693
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:46,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, slowly but surely, other small businesses and restaurants are benefiting from it.

694
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:48,748
[SPEAKER_00]: St.

695
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:50,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis just had their 100th anniversary.

696
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:59,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill jumped right up to the plate, gave four premium tickets to the Irish Tenors and Johnny Mathis to support our endeavors.

697
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill goes beyond the Chevalier.

698
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:05,192
[SPEAKER_00]: He's brought so much more to Medford than just the theater alone.

699
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:18,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you for all of your efforts in recognizing the strength and the work that the people, both on the Friends of Chevalier and the commission have done, because it's a real jewel and we can't let it go.

700
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:20,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

701
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:22,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Cindy.

702
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:24,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further public participation?

703
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:27,314
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to Councilor Caraviello.

704
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:29,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I'll just read the press release.

705
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:44,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Wynn Resorts, the company that helped build the massive Encore Boston Harbor Casino and Hotel Never Announced Tuesday, it has entered into an agreement to sell the land and real estate assets of the property to a San Diego-based realty income.

706
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:47,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Wynn Resorts said it will continue to operate the property.

707
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:50,969
[SPEAKER_17]: The company said the deal is worth 1.7 billion.

708
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:54,211
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I don't know what their thinking is with this.

709
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this another way of?

710
00:47:56,573 --> 00:48:02,375
[SPEAKER_17]: getting around it, I'm sure their legal team is a lot more vast than all of ours.

711
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:05,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where we're at.

712
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it's one maneuver after another maneuver with these people.

713
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:13,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, Cindy's right, when they came into town, don't worry, life is great.

714
00:48:13,198 --> 00:48:15,339
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, promises were made.

715
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:20,181
[SPEAKER_17]: John Tarko came, he met with every chamber of commerce and every group that wanted to listen to him.

716
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:22,561
[SPEAKER_17]: And don't worry, we're gonna be a good neighbor.

717
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:23,682
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the day,

718
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:26,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Like everyone else, they're not a good neighbor.

719
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:29,848
[SPEAKER_17]: They got their foot in the door, and they did what they wanted to do.

720
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

721
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:33,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, you may come to the podium.

722
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:42,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I was interested in the topic.

723
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:43,325
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly is important.

724
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:51,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping that we have other development beside leaning on to value all the time for some commercialism in the city.

725
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:57,886
[SPEAKER_11]: However, has anyone talked to the mayors of the other city surrounded and being affected by this too.

726
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:03,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering whatever it's doing what Maldon's doing Adam, does anybody know what their path is.

727
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:09,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And secondly, some of us are confused, the ground with gold cinder blocks if they can get this thing.

728
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:25,412
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, there have been efforts, I believe, with the Friends of Chevalier and the Chevalier Commission to reach out to places like Beverly, Salem, places with similar sized, they're not neighboring communities, but it's similar competition with, you know, the Cabot Theater, institutions like that.

729
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:26,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know some of that has happened.

730
00:49:26,892 --> 00:49:28,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's happening between our mayor and other mayor.

731
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:37,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So would the bridge in other words and also the center itself be in the original contract that was presented to Medford when we, you know, agreed.

732
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:51,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this sounds oversimplified I understand, being an office, but we are mayors a lawyer, has she made any suggestions of the path that someone should pursue we also have local men

733
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:57,330
[SPEAKER_11]: who have been here, who have been lawyers for years and have represented our developers.

734
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:04,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we have a staunch contract with that firm after Attorney Romney left.

735
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:05,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

736
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:10,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of us are a little confused about how a legal pursuit would happen.

737
00:50:10,453 --> 00:50:12,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, suppose it just wasn't this issue.

738
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:13,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Suppose it was something else.

739
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:16,734
[SPEAKER_11]: We always have to call that particular firm up.

740
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:18,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you call outside counsel?

741
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:25,921
[SPEAKER_11]: For that I we just contracted with this firm I forget the name I'm sorry.

742
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:35,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it seems to me if it's if we're in agreement in their agreement with our original contract.

743
00:50:36,154 --> 00:50:39,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is this a state court issue or is this a local issue.

744
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:52,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a state court issue it's also the Gaming Commission, all I can say is that this council has not received any communication from the administration about a specific plan to address this on legal terms other than that, I, you know,

745
00:50:53,329 --> 00:51:03,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm just surprised that there hasn't been a plan, you know, staunchly presented to you because she knows a lot of legalities and I think she had her own practice in Medford.

746
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:05,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Why she hasn't had a meeting with you, maybe she has.

747
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:20,095
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seems to me that you can even be partly your own, you could be your own advocate in part with the developing lawyer that we have, a developer lawyer type, just to throw out a name, I'm just thinking of like, I've seen Bobby Abruzzi here many times.

748
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:22,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just, you know, saying,

749
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:27,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't there another path that we can start to follow to speed this up.

750
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:30,617
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the difficulty.

751
00:51:30,657 --> 00:51:35,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, this resolution tonight, we are asking the mayor to spend this money.

752
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:39,739
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the authority to initiate the spending of money as a city council.

753
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:49,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So in reality, the mayor would need to either spend the money out of her legal services budget or send an appropriation request to the city council for some additional amount.

754
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:50,721
[SPEAKER_09]: That hasn't happened.

755
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:52,222
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't generate that ourselves.

756
00:51:52,262 --> 00:51:54,822
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the ability to spend money without the request of the mayor.

757
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:58,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that, but in the appropriation tonight for 2,500, where's that going?

758
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:16,971
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not technically an appropriation it's a request that the count the council is asking the mayor to spend that money, but it is not, it has, it's not, but you don't force that okay so you don't know the firm yet or the allocated legal, I believe it's to join whichever firm, Mr. Blumenreich is currently working with.

759
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:17,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

760
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:18,772
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

761
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:21,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought she might know, you know, being the mayor.

762
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:33,444
[SPEAKER_11]: one particular firm who may be specializes in something like that, or you might be able to call it Paul Donato he may he he's probably had a lot of experience with the state don't you think Councilor Caraviello.

763
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:44,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I think Paul Donato may know some names to through the state again we can have all the names you want the, if the man, again, we don't like, like the President said we don't have the right to initiate.

764
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:47,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just thought maybe this council would entertain any again.

765
00:52:52,233 --> 00:53:00,536
[SPEAKER_17]: We pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a law firm that's working against us, against us, not for us.

766
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:02,257
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going the other way.

767
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,598
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't serve two masters, all right?

768
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:16,482
[SPEAKER_17]: All this money, in fact, after this, I'm gonna amend this, that all these funds come out of the KP law budget, not out of legal counsel, but the KP law budget.

769
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:18,743
[SPEAKER_17]: They deserted us when we needed them.

770
00:53:21,377 --> 00:53:25,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just mentioned Paul's name because I thought being in a state position.

771
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but he may have seen this happen before, that's all.

772
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:32,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at this point.

773
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:34,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ricky.

774
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:35,790
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a couple of other people.

775
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,393
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I'm gonna recognize Mike Oliver, acting chairperson of the Chevalier Commission.

776
00:53:40,774 --> 00:53:42,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Oliver, I've requested that you unmute.

777
00:53:43,396 --> 00:53:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could just wait a moment for us, Ms.

778
00:53:44,938 --> 00:53:46,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Watson, we have a couple of people on Zoom.

779
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Oliver.

780
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

781
00:54:10,218 --> 00:54:11,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Oliver, you're on.

782
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:14,560
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could give us your name and address for the record and then give us your comments.

783
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

784
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:19,422
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Mike Oliver.

785
00:54:19,442 --> 00:54:27,127
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of you who don't know who I am, I am the acting chairperson of the Chevalier Theatre Commission.

786
00:54:28,528 --> 00:54:35,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a rather simple, I'm sure I missed some of the earlier comments, but I just wanted to just let you know, this is a really simple request.

787
00:54:37,595 --> 00:54:46,061
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Encore has reduced the size of its proposed

788
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:54,040
[SPEAKER_12]: development to fit within the guidelines that are in the law.

789
00:54:55,942 --> 00:55:03,969
[SPEAKER_12]: However, Encore has shown that cannot be trusted and we have to be wary of them.

790
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,471
[SPEAKER_12]: So what are we asking for?

791
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:10,935
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not asking you for money because we know you can't do that.

792
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,978
[SPEAKER_12]: We're asking you to support the mayor

793
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:22,294
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, so she can feel like she can Do this and engage this lawyer now.

794
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:24,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do we want this lawyer thinking that?

795
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:29,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Encore is capitulated and and is going to do what it's supposed to do.

796
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:43,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we believe that There are some legal issues and I sent you all an email which I'll write them That this lawyer can look into that can further bottle up encore

797
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:52,986
[SPEAKER_12]: make no mistake, Encore is a threat to Chevalier.

798
00:55:54,747 --> 00:56:10,234
[SPEAKER_12]: If Encore can do an end around the gaming commission and build a facility that will hold or have any combination of facilities that will hold 1,800 people, Chevalier is dead.

799
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:12,955
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have an empty building.

800
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:15,777
[SPEAKER_12]: What we're trying to do

801
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:31,623
[SPEAKER_12]: is caught in a cost-effective way is to bottle them up, is to put every roadblock we can possibly put in their way to keep them from realizing its ambitions.

802
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:41,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Now don't, Iran Corp is not, they're not a nice group, but they're not doing this for altruistic reasons.

803
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:46,926
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why they wanna build a development, another development, because they need the money.

804
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:49,867
[SPEAKER_12]: They want to attract more people to the casino.

805
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:57,229
[SPEAKER_12]: A venue that has music or some kind of entertainment will certainly be a draw.

806
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:00,890
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why they're doing it.

807
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:07,451
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not doing it because they want everyone to have an auditorium.

808
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:10,312
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doing it for financial reasons.

809
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:16,693
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're asking for is just your, somehow the mayor feels

810
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:20,157
[SPEAKER_12]: She needs your support to do this.

811
00:57:20,197 --> 00:57:22,038
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that she could have done weeks ago.

812
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:26,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Why she feels she needs your support, you'll have to ask her.

813
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:40,010
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's not a bad idea in principle that the council should support the mayor and Mr. Council should support the commission and all those who are trying to save the building.

814
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:45,233
[SPEAKER_12]: So simple request.

815
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:49,560
[SPEAKER_12]: say, like they say, we're not asking you for the money.

816
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:57,085
[SPEAKER_12]: All we're asking you is to say, okay, mayor, we support you in the $2,500.

817
00:57:57,925 --> 00:57:59,767
[SPEAKER_12]: The commission has already committed its money.

818
00:58:00,427 --> 00:58:01,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Women Rights committed its money.

819
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:06,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some of you are afraid that legal costs could balloon out.

820
00:58:07,592 --> 00:58:16,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this won't happen because we only want this guy to do a very narrow set of things that I outlined in the email I sent you in two weeks.

821
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:19,838
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the February 28th, it's over.

822
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So we hope, because that's when the public comment period is over.

823
00:58:26,063 --> 00:58:31,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I all hope that you, all of you, make a comment.

824
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:34,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we need a unified effort here.

825
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,814
[SPEAKER_12]: We want the Chevalier to be the Chevalier.

826
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:44,017
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to say, we want the Chevalier to be the Chevalier.

827
00:58:45,618 --> 00:58:47,500
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, we can't be bickering among ourselves.

828
00:58:48,961 --> 00:58:53,984
[SPEAKER_12]: The importance of the building, the building's important for many reasons that people have outlined.

829
00:58:54,825 --> 00:59:05,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So the mayor, you know, we've outlined with the mayor, this is a short term project, very short term, two weeks.

830
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:12,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I respect the work of the chairman, but you know, when we're looking at an issue like this, legal strategy is what we need.

831
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:14,920
[SPEAKER_08]: We need legal strategy.

832
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:20,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the commission's made up of a number of great individuals that do a lot of work in this community.

833
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:22,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how many of them are lawyers.

834
00:59:23,546 --> 00:59:29,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how many of them have expertise in contract law and dealing with issues like this.

835
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:35,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's where the council's concern is coming from.

836
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:37,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we don't care about the drop in the bucket, 2,500 bucks.

837
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,790
[SPEAKER_08]: We care about the long-term impact.

838
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill Blumenreich's contract is up in a year.

839
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And he says, you know what?

840
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:45,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Encore's happening.

841
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,932
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not, I'm just not in it anymore.

842
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,654
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing, nothing here for me and he walks.

843
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:50,916
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens to our case?

844
00:59:52,618 --> 00:59:56,484
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens to our case if Bill decides he doesn't want to renew and he walks and we're in the middle of litigation?

845
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:58,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the big concern that I have.

846
01:00:00,788 --> 01:00:02,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, and thank you, Mr. Oliver.

847
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:03,749
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate your comment.

848
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:06,210
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the letter and the works of the Chevalier Commission.

849
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:12,653
[SPEAKER_09]: This council has also sent a letter to be entered into the public comment period for this issue before the Gaming Commission.

850
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:15,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go to Ken Krause next, and then we'll come back to you, Ms.

851
01:00:15,855 --> 01:00:16,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Cindy Watson.

852
01:00:16,855 --> 01:00:18,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Ken, I'm gonna unmute you right now.

853
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Please give us your name and address for the record.

854
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:28,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street, Medford, also on the board of the Friends of Chevalier.

855
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:37,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the support that's been stated for this measure and for the passionate support for Chevalier Theatre.

856
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:49,124
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a complicated matter, but it is something that everyone who's been following this and been engaged in the various meetings for the last two and a half months

857
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:56,592
[SPEAKER_14]: feel it's just it's crucial that the city have a legal representative.

858
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:08,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't disagree that the city should be more determined to have a stronger legal presence, but that just we've been told that the

859
01:01:09,445 --> 01:01:27,490
[SPEAKER_14]: The legal department didn't have the capacity so others have helped try to provide some guidance to get the help that the city needs and it's frustrating as a taxpayer who is paying the salaries of our legal department and other folks and

860
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:41,603
[SPEAKER_14]: The statement was made about the commission and its expertise well the commission is putting up $2,500 to help pay for city legal representation that we should already have in place.

861
01:01:42,123 --> 01:01:45,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's that's doubly frustrating but be that as it may.

862
01:01:46,965 --> 01:02:01,860
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a question about the other communities and engagement and the Chevalier Commission and former Commissioner John Costas has been leading an effort to gather the stakeholders to have a unified voice in opposition to this.

863
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,166
[SPEAKER_14]: And that group did meet and included a representative from the city of Lynn.

864
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:19,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Lynn has a comparable facility attached to Lynn City Hall, Lynn Auditorium, that has similar types of shows that would be threatened by Encore being able to put on the shows in its venue.

865
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, by the way, the crux of the matter is

866
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:33,511
[SPEAKER_14]: win resorts gaming license prohibits it from building a entertainment venue unless it is under 1000 seats or above 3500 seats.

867
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're doing two things.

868
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:38,154
[SPEAKER_14]: One, they've been violating the agreement

869
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:49,396
[SPEAKER_14]: for a couple of years, or they were as of 2019, by holding events in their ballroom that had up to 2,600 seats capacity.

870
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:58,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was a clear violation that we have to get the Gaming Commission to remind them and reinforce the gaming regulations that prohibit them from doing that.

871
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:03,660
[SPEAKER_14]: They're also prohibited from building another facility as they're proposed here.

872
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,140
[SPEAKER_14]: What's curious is

873
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:19,363
[SPEAKER_14]: At the meeting that Wynne presented to the gaming commission, they said, well, this is a totally different entity across the street, East of Broadway LLC, even though it's a subsidiary of Wynne Resorts.

874
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:21,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't have anything to do with that.

875
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:24,124
[SPEAKER_14]: They're building it over there, even though it's directly connected.

876
01:03:24,184 --> 01:03:34,107
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the announcement that Councilor Caraviello mentioned tonight is also interesting and muddies the water even more because Wynne says it's selling

877
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:46,270
[SPEAKER_14]: the real estate and land of the Encore Boston Harbor Casino, but it says Wynn is retaining the 13 acre east of Broadway portion of its development across the street.

878
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:54,672
[SPEAKER_14]: On one hand, they said they didn't have a stake across the street, so the gaming commission laws regulations didn't apply to them.

879
01:03:55,053 --> 01:03:58,353
[SPEAKER_14]: But here today, they're saying they do own that land over there.

880
01:03:58,954 --> 01:04:03,935
[SPEAKER_14]: It calls into question Wynn's credibility in this.

881
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:08,236
[SPEAKER_14]: that hasn't been complying with the legal agreement that it signed.

882
01:04:08,296 --> 01:04:16,257
[SPEAKER_14]: It was supposed to notify a coalition of about 10 smaller venues that it agreed to work with to help protect their assets.

883
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:22,578
[SPEAKER_14]: It was supposed to notify them in writing if they were going to ever build a facility of 1,800 seats or so.

884
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:23,478
[SPEAKER_14]: It never did that.

885
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It admitted to the Gaming Commission.

886
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:25,639
[SPEAKER_14]: It never did that.

887
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:33,980
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a lot of things that we can point to in terms of the legality of their position.

888
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:53,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And the presence of an attorney that can cite case law and other examples of business entities that were combined into one and were determined to be one entity, it's important to present that to the gaming commission so they understand exactly what is being done here.

889
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:54,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they can see what's being done.

890
01:04:54,964 --> 01:04:59,607
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope that helps clarify a little bit of kind of what's been going on.

891
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,047
[SPEAKER_14]: over the last two and a half months.

892
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:06,168
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I want to thank the council for supporting this.

893
01:05:06,628 --> 01:05:25,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we need a lot more might, but the time to have the legal representation is very short because, as was mentioned, the public comment period ends next Friday, the public hearing is February 28th, and the Gaming Commission is planning to decide on March 3rd.

894
01:05:26,252 --> 01:05:29,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you again for your support and allowing me to provide some more information.

895
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:32,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Krauss.

896
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:42,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you don't need a big legal team to look at the organizational chart and see when it says Wynn Resorts and then East of Broadway and then Encore Wynn Casino, that it's all part of one company.

897
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

898
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:49,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Collins.

899
01:05:51,203 --> 01:05:51,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Councilor Caraviello.

900
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:55,385
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to amend the motion that this funds come out of the KP law budget.

901
01:06:09,338 --> 01:06:12,400
[SPEAKER_09]: the line item for counsel for legal services in the law department.

902
01:06:15,863 --> 01:06:17,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's the, there's no KP law budget.

903
01:06:17,805 --> 01:06:19,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the line item for legal services in that.

904
01:06:19,606 --> 01:06:19,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

905
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:39,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the public?

906
01:06:44,954 --> 01:06:52,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Zach, just for point of clarification, as Adam indicated, we need a specialized attorney and Bill does have one in mind.

907
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:56,956
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an entertainment venue attorney.

908
01:06:57,376 --> 01:07:00,937
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't go to an ophthalmologist if he had a gastroenterology problem.

909
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:04,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the reasons why we're relying on his expertise.

910
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:08,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, someone mentioned Paul Donato.

911
01:07:08,293 --> 01:07:11,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Donato is on the Friends of Chevalier Boyd.

912
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:16,236
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been for many, many years and has contributed an enormous amount of time.

913
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:24,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Money has gotten previous governors to veto certain issues so that we could get additional funding for seating, et cetera, in there.

914
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:33,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I'd like to say, in Brianna's email to me, she indicated that she was going to the Boys to Men concert on Friday night.

915
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:34,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously,

916
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:36,442
[SPEAKER_00]: she does like to Shabani.

917
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:39,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you.

918
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:40,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Cindy.

919
01:07:40,864 --> 01:07:43,224
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Knight.

920
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:45,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

921
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:48,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

922
01:07:48,506 --> 01:07:48,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

923
01:07:58,553 --> 01:07:59,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Bearish.

924
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:00,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I move to resume the negative.

925
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:02,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes as amended.

926
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:04,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, motion to take papers under suspension.

927
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Papers under suspension.

928
01:08:06,642 --> 01:08:09,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Which paper is that?

929
01:08:09,525 --> 01:08:09,505
22079.

930
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Councilor Caraviello to take paper 22-079.

931
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:14,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by?

932
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:16,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

933
01:08:16,532 --> 01:08:17,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

934
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,727
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

935
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:29,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

936
01:08:29,388 --> 01:08:29,488
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

937
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:47,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, 70% of the negative papers taken off the, from under suspension.

938
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:51,153
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-079 offered under suspension by Councilor Caraviello.

939
01:08:51,854 --> 01:09:00,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Being so resolved that the Medford City Council and the Mayor's Office immediately send the City Engineer slash DPW Director to East Border Circle to address repairs that need to be done in the interest of public safety.

940
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Being further resolved that DPW come up with an emergency plan to address the major pothole problem within our city.

941
01:09:06,023 --> 01:09:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

942
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

943
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:09,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know,

944
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:15,105
[SPEAKER_17]: how none of us have gotten a call on this street.

945
01:09:15,445 --> 01:09:24,030
[SPEAKER_17]: When I had the opportunity to do something on that street, when I turned over there, I was like appalled by what I saw there.

946
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:28,573
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there was literally no street there for these people to get it done.

947
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:31,995
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how these people are going home every day and having cars left over.

948
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:35,117
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it is so, it's probably about a 20,

949
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:43,951
[SPEAKER_17]: probably at least a 20-30 foot section that is just really just torn to holes and the hot tub is just gone.

950
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:49,498
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say, I'm shocked that none of us have gotten a call on this sooner.

951
01:09:50,138 --> 01:09:52,741
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, these people deserve a lot better than this.

952
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:57,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I have no idea how they're gonna fix this other than putting some plates down

953
01:09:58,142 --> 01:10:04,125
[SPEAKER_17]: over that part of the road for these people to drive in and out of the streets without causing further damage to their car.

954
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:13,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we've all driven around the city in the last week or so and seen the craters that are around the city.

955
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,712
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, how much more can we keep filling these holes up?

956
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:26,298
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think at some point, very soon, this DPW is gonna have to come up with some type of program either to address the roads

957
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,882
[SPEAKER_17]: hire a pothole company in the community and cut them out and fix these, right?

958
01:10:30,902 --> 01:10:37,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Because all we're doing is just throwing money into potholes or just as soon as it gets a little rain, they wash away.

959
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:41,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

960
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:42,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Ntuk.

961
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

962
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:50,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Discussion by members of the public, feel free to come to the podium.

963
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

964
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:14,189
[SPEAKER_13]: One time ago, I'm wondering if, if there's a better way to fill these potholes so they actually stay filled, or as Councilor Dello Russo called them, potholes.

965
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:16,110
[SPEAKER_17]: There are companies that do do that.

966
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,530
[SPEAKER_17]: They come in, they cut them out and they fix them.

967
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,570
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was thinking a little further out of the box.

968
01:11:20,331 --> 01:11:27,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we should speak to someone who has more experience than us in colder fluctuations of temperatures up and down, such as.

969
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:32,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, Iceland, I don't know.

970
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:36,997
[SPEAKER_13]: But it seems like they pop up everywhere.

971
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:46,023
[SPEAKER_13]: As Councilor Marches has said, I go put a glass of milk in my dish, on my dashboard, and by the time I get to Brigham's, it becomes a milkshake.

972
01:11:46,743 --> 01:11:47,284
[SPEAKER_13]: It is bad.

973
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,085
[SPEAKER_13]: There's gotta be a better way of,

974
01:11:51,242 --> 01:11:57,286
[SPEAKER_13]: fill in the holes, I mean, maybe cut them at an angle, whether it's inside or outside going down.

975
01:11:57,626 --> 01:12:02,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure, but it doesn't make sense why it just keeps crumbling.

976
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:03,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It's getting worse and worse.

977
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:10,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And to fix the a hundred miles of roads, it would cost more than what the government gave us, the 15 million, by the way.

978
01:12:12,456 --> 01:12:13,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Gasolini.

979
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

980
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,040
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

981
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

982
01:12:21,286 --> 01:12:21,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

983
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:21,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

984
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:21,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

985
01:12:22,068 --> 01:12:22,288

1012
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:42,146
[SPEAKER_09]: In just two meetings, we were able to get through the 71 recommendations offered by the Community Development Board.

[SPEAKER_09]: John J. Petrella would like the following to be put on the next city council agenda.

1027
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,157
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-058, 22-059, Senate Bill S1579, House Bill H2418, 22-062, 22-063, 22-064,

1028
01:14:45,844 --> 01:14:47,065
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-065, 22-066.

1029
01:14:47,225 --> 01:14:59,110
[SPEAKER_09]: These items certainly, I assume these are to be discussed, but they have been proceeded with and dispensed with pertaining to the rules of this council.

1030
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:00,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Petrarola, if you'd like to speak.

1031
01:15:08,313 --> 01:15:08,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all.

1032
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:10,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me speak tonight.

1033
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,215
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just gonna be brief.

1034
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,641
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have really a few questions.

1035
01:15:16,922 --> 01:15:34,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very curious, and the reason I put all these down, and there's a lot more, S-159, House Bill 2418, Safe Communities Act, public transit, electrification, 22065, it goes on and on.

1036
01:15:36,776 --> 01:15:43,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I know like tonight was a lot of discussion about method, and I'm curious,

1037
01:15:44,067 --> 01:16:05,083
[SPEAKER_18]: When you guys discuss all this and you pass it and everything else, I mean, it seems to me a lot of this has to do with the state, national, I don't know, but they're going to the regulatory oversight commission, Pacheco, Cabral, joint committee on public safety, homeland security.

1038
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Timothy and Gonzalez.

1039
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:12,875
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I imagine some of them deal with Medford.

1040
01:16:13,276 --> 01:16:15,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I think some of them probably don't.

1041
01:16:15,457 --> 01:16:29,228
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I have them all here and I was just reading through them and I'm just curious, when you pass this or however you do it, does that reflect all of Medford or is it just the city council's point of view?

1042
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly reflects the opinion of the Medford City Council.

1043
01:16:34,272 --> 01:16:35,593
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just the city council.

1044
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,871
[SPEAKER_09]: as elected by the majority of the voters of the city.

1045
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:49,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so that's not my question is, when you send something like this in, okay, I know that we elected you, okay?

1046
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:51,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that.

1047
01:16:52,178 --> 01:16:56,940
[SPEAKER_18]: We elected you to take care of Medford, okay?

1048
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:02,023
[SPEAKER_18]: If I have a problem or I wanna do something with the state, I deal with,

1049
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:10,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I've dealt with Catherine Clark, she's helped me a few times, whatever, Paul Donato, I can go on and on.

1050
01:17:10,844 --> 01:17:17,068
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm trying to, I guess my question is, I'm a little confused, okay?

1051
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:17,949
[SPEAKER_18]: So bear with me.

1052
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:25,094
[SPEAKER_18]: My question is, when you send this into the state, are you representing me?

1053
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:28,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we represent the entire city of Medford and all of its residents.

1054
01:17:30,773 --> 01:17:37,777
[SPEAKER_18]: So if this goes into the state, if this goes into the Department of Homeland Security, you represent all of Medford.

1055
01:17:38,057 --> 01:17:40,799
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how democracy works, yes.

1056
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:43,941
[SPEAKER_18]: I know how democracy works.

1057
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:44,862
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't need a lesson.

1058
01:17:45,402 --> 01:17:46,483
[SPEAKER_09]: You said you were confused, sir.

1059
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,224
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, no, no.

1060
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:50,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just trying to figure out.

1061
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:54,323
[SPEAKER_18]: we elected you to represent method.

1062
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this just symbolism?

1063
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:57,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that what it is?

1064
01:17:57,303 --> 01:18:05,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, subject, if I may, you know, the way that the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts works, and I'm happy to get into it into a dialogue about it.

1065
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:15,268
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the powers delegated to cities and towns, municipalities in the Commonwealth are delegated by the Massachusetts Constitution, and subject to the Massachusetts general laws.

1066
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:16,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you know, the city charter of

1067
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:21,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford is pursuant to Massachusetts general law, chapter 43.

1068
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:35,844
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, this city and all of its powers are directly related to the laws and, and other regulations of the Commonwealth, you know, without the, you know,

1069
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:39,699
[SPEAKER_09]: the powers of this city are dictated by the state.

1070
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:49,263
[SPEAKER_09]: If we want to adjust those powers or request changes to those powers or otherwise ask the state to take action that supports the city of Menford, that's what we would be doing in those cases.

1071
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:51,464
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, you mentioned the electrification of buses.

1072
01:18:51,524 --> 01:18:56,206
[SPEAKER_09]: We have many MBTA bus routes spewing pollution throughout the community.

1073
01:18:56,286 --> 01:19:01,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, we may request of the state that they make changes to those things.

1074
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:03,989
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, I think you referenced House Bill

1075
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:17,758
[SPEAKER_09]: S1579H2418, which if I remember correctly is Safe Communities Act, you know, that would reflect on the many residents of this community who may otherwise be engaging with state and local authorities.

1076
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:25,699
[SPEAKER_09]: We also discussed something on pilots, which is about the city's home rule authority to regulate large tax exempt institutions.

1077
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:34,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it is the business of this city to advocate for what we believe is the best possible state legal framework that would allow us to represent the citizens of Medford.

1078
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:40,424
[SPEAKER_18]: So it carries, I don't mean to interrupt you, Zach, I apologize, but it carries weight then, that's what you're telling me.

1079
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:41,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we would hope so.

1080
01:19:44,186 --> 01:19:45,106
[SPEAKER_18]: It does carry weight.

1081
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:47,847
[SPEAKER_18]: You're representing all of us when you send this in.

1082
01:19:48,548 --> 01:19:55,551
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm trying to figure out, because I've talked to other people and it's this confusion about this, that's all.

1083
01:19:55,651 --> 01:19:58,453
[SPEAKER_18]: So it carries weight, if you send it in,

1084
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:07,178
[SPEAKER_18]: to the state, and you're telling the state, yeah, we love this and we want to do, you know, build H248, City of Methods, all four.

1085
01:20:07,618 --> 01:20:08,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it carries weight.

1086
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:10,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We would hope so, yes.

1087
01:20:11,283 --> 01:20:13,527
[SPEAKER_18]: You say you hope so, but either does or it doesn't.

1088
01:20:14,036 --> 01:20:20,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we don't know why the legislators make specific decisions that they make, but we hope that when they do, they consider the opinions of this council.

1089
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:27,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, I'm not looking, I was just looking for a couple of answers to that because- They can make a point to the gentleman.

1090
01:20:28,108 --> 01:20:30,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, actually Councilor Collins and then Councilor Caraviello.

1091
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:31,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

1092
01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:34,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, sorry, okay, Councilor Collins.

1093
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and thank you for coming to speak with us tonight.

1094
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:47,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you, you know, I think I was the one that put 22059 and some others directed at our state house delegations leaders in the state house on the agenda.

1095
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:54,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give you a window into my thinking, I want to see the council advocating for measures that I think would improve life for people.

1096
01:20:55,089 --> 01:21:05,718
[SPEAKER_01]: in Medford, in my view, and I know that not even all the other Councilors on this body feel the same way, but to me, part of my role as a Councilor is advocating for measures that will improve life for people who live at Medford.

1097
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:11,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Often that's going to include things that we can do within this body, within our purview, in the form of a resolution or an ordinance.

1098
01:21:12,223 --> 01:21:16,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times that's going to mean advocating for something that is the state's authority.

1099
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:19,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to me, I think it's analogous to, you know, when I call up

1100
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,920
[SPEAKER_01]: my representative, you know, and tell her how I think about a bill.

1101
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that she takes it into the count.

1102
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:30,625
[SPEAKER_01]: When we happen to send a letter that we vote in favor on to our state delegation, we might hope that they might take that into account.

1103
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:31,405
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.

1104
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:33,086
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no algorithm, but we hope so.

1105
01:21:33,626 --> 01:21:33,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1106
01:21:34,067 --> 01:21:36,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You answered the question.

1107
01:21:36,248 --> 01:21:41,651
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of that stuff we do, a lot of them never make it out of committee.

1108
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:54,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, we support things that, you know, maybe not everybody in the council, but again, some of that stuff, they go in, as Councilor Ntuk has mentioned in the past, the way they go in isn't the way they come out.

1109
01:21:54,842 --> 01:22:00,246
[SPEAKER_17]: But let's say there's a lot of stuff we support, never, let's say, never even makes it off the ground.

1110
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:09,314
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, you know, it does have meaning, some people, some of it is symbolic and some of it's not, but again, it's, you know,

1111
01:22:10,965 --> 01:22:23,777
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're not in favor of that you can you call your state, some that we vote on the call you state senator you state representative and you're not in favor, but again to say a lot of them just don't ever make it out of the committee.

1112
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:24,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1113
01:22:29,556 --> 01:22:32,997
[SPEAKER_16]: President Bears, Councilor Collins, and Councilor Caraviello put it very well.

1114
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:34,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to clear up the narrative.

1115
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:40,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I just checked 22-062 all the way to 22-065.

1116
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:43,042
[SPEAKER_16]: At least on my record, it's not for the state.

1117
01:22:43,122 --> 01:22:46,363
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all targeted for the city of Bedford.

1118
01:22:46,703 --> 01:22:47,824
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to clarify that.

1119
01:22:47,924 --> 01:22:48,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Sanders.

1120
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, not a problem.

1121
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:50,905
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with you.

1122
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:56,988
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, there was so many things going on and I was just wondering

1123
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:01,279
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I mean, there's a lot of things going on in method.

1124
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,082
[SPEAKER_18]: I just thought the focus was on method, but you answered my question, so I'm happy about that.

1125
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:17,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, you know, I'm just, another thing while I'm here and while we've been talking about legal work and everything else, I, you know, you hear all these things.

1126
01:23:17,807 --> 01:23:24,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very curious if someone can answer how many lawsuits, okay, have been filed

1127
01:23:26,552 --> 01:23:27,732
[SPEAKER_18]: against the city of Medford.

1128
01:23:27,772 --> 01:23:34,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone... I'm aware of at least 20 labor charges and three MCAD complaints pending at this point in time.

1129
01:23:35,195 --> 01:23:44,177
[SPEAKER_09]: There were also several judgments against the city for a number of pretty standard issues with roads and sidewalks as far as I could tell, but I don't have that number off the top of my head.

1130
01:23:45,217 --> 01:23:46,758
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're telling me that...

1131
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so you're telling me there's over 20.

1132
01:23:51,771 --> 01:24:01,416
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, all cities, and we know they have a few here in the air, someone fell on the sidewalk or whatever, but I'm sorry, can you repeat what you said, Adam?

1133
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:09,701
[SPEAKER_08]: There's over 20 labor charges filed anyway, for failure to negotiate, violation of rights and the like.

1134
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:15,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's my understanding there's at least three MCAD complaints that are pending.

1135
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:21,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Protello, I believe that you could contact the city solicitor and ask.

1136
01:24:22,485 --> 01:24:23,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no, I will.

1137
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:36,368
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just curious because you can't seem to, I mean, that just... And the city, the taxpayers, all of us, you guys, everybody is responsible for these.

1138
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, with the labor charges alone, the labor charge is not even litigation.

1139
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:42,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's pretty much just fighting with your employees.

1140
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:43,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1141
01:24:43,749 --> 01:24:45,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Those aren't lawsuits in court yet.

1142
01:24:47,745 --> 01:24:48,405
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not, yes?

1143
01:24:48,785 --> 01:24:49,466
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you mean?

1144
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:50,506
[SPEAKER_09]: They may or may not, yeah.

1145
01:24:50,826 --> 01:24:54,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It's currently with the Department of Labor Relations, if I understand the process correctly.

1146
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:57,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It's administrative law, though, so it's not like, you know what I mean?

1147
01:24:58,029 --> 01:25:00,150
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to go through the Administrative Tribunal first.

1148
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:00,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1149
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:07,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Just curious, you hear all this, and then my last question, and then I'll be on my way.

1150
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:16,257
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to, you know, you look on the city site and there's, you know, we all know what the council is responsible for, the mayor,

1151
01:25:17,289 --> 01:25:19,050
[SPEAKER_18]: school committee, and on and on and on.

1152
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:24,974
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a new position, Chief People Person.

1153
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:30,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Can anyone tell me what the description is, what the job description is, what it does?

1154
01:25:30,557 --> 01:25:30,937
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

1155
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:33,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that title is accurate.

1156
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:41,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the title was Chief People Officer, and Chief People Person may have become colloquialism.

1157
01:25:45,302 --> 01:25:57,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe there's a paper pending before this Council on the table waiting a legal opinion that would create a position of human resources director, which I believe is what the title has been adjusted to, which would direct the Department of Human Resources.

1158
01:25:59,474 --> 01:26:04,619
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so the person that's doing the job right now, it's going to end up being human resource director.

1159
01:26:07,437 --> 01:26:11,779
[SPEAKER_08]: John, let's not get the political data confused with the political reality, all right?

1160
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,021
[SPEAKER_08]: The name of the position was whenever they were going to call it to see what they could do to get it passed, all right?

1161
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:19,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the roles and responsibilities were going to be the same no matter what they were.

1162
01:26:20,183 --> 01:26:24,945
[SPEAKER_08]: But they just wanted to change the name to see if the name was going to change the temperature of the council to get it passed at the time.

1163
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:28,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you for being honest, Adam.

1164
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:31,108
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that.

1165
01:26:31,268 --> 01:26:32,388
[SPEAKER_18]: You answered my question.

1166
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:32,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1167
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:37,664
[SPEAKER_18]: So did, I mean, you guys approved it, obviously.

1168
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:41,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's currently on the table awaiting a legal opinion.

1169
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:47,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just gonna ask this then, because I don't know.

1170
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:54,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone's doing this job and we're paying him, but you haven't approved it yet.

1171
01:26:54,955 --> 01:26:55,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that what you're telling me?

1172
01:26:56,035 --> 01:26:56,576
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't get it.

1173
01:26:57,376 --> 01:26:58,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Therein lies the rub, my friend.

1174
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:03,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The council has funded the position in several budgets.

1175
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:12,286
[SPEAKER_09]: However, amendments to the personal ordinance have not been made, and that is subject of an ongoing dispute within the council and between the council and the mayor.

1176
01:27:13,447 --> 01:27:14,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a fair characterization.

1177
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:17,713
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so basically you guys agreed to fund it.

1178
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,262
[SPEAKER_09]: We approved the budget that included the position, yes.

1179
01:27:21,543 --> 01:27:22,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's all.

1180
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:23,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Just curious.

1181
01:27:23,284 --> 01:27:23,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Adam.

1182
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:25,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you all.

1183
01:27:25,066 --> 01:27:26,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate all the answers.

1184
01:27:26,748 --> 01:27:27,128
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

1185
01:27:27,489 --> 01:27:28,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1186
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:32,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further members of the public who would like to participate?

1187
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we will go to the records.

1188
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:45,483
[SPEAKER_09]: The records of the February 8th meeting, 2022 meeting were passed to Councilor Caraviello.

1189
01:27:45,943 --> 01:27:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello, I had one amendment to those records, if you don't mind.

1190
01:27:49,829 --> 01:27:52,112
[SPEAKER_09]: It was at the end of the meeting,

1191
01:27:53,013 --> 01:28:03,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to pull it up directly, but essentially it was, I believe I verbally said it was a motion of Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Knight to reconsider.

1192
01:28:04,202 --> 01:28:07,745
[SPEAKER_09]: It should have been a motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by President Morell.

1193
01:28:07,785 --> 01:28:09,687
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my misspeaking at the podium.

1194
01:28:10,247 --> 01:28:11,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the records could reflect that.

1195
01:28:12,129 --> 01:28:13,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1196
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:15,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Other than that, I find the record.

1197
01:28:15,451 --> 01:28:18,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there another motion for approval?

1198
01:28:18,974 --> 01:28:19,435
[SPEAKER_09]: She was not.

1199
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:22,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, there was a motion to approve as amended.

1200
01:28:23,237 --> 01:28:23,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1201
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Knight Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1202
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:37,586
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, for records to approve as amended.

1206
01:28:55,806 --> 01:28:56,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion adjourned.

1207
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:59,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion adjourned by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins.

Yes.

01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:11,472
