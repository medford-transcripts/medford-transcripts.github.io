Okay.

00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:33,312
Okay.

5
00:01:59,185 --> 00:01:59,385
No, she did.

6
00:01:59,405 --> 00:01:59,965
She made it to international.

7
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:00,125
So, look.

8
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:00,365
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,025
So, you have states, which is this.

10
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:01,625
She didn't, but she could have.

11
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:02,126
She just, I remember that.

12
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:02,626
Just one year last year.

13
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:03,106
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, we have three.

14
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first year, we went to the national team.

15
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:30,805
Yeah.

16
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,910

th th

25
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,236
I've been asking for two days.

26
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,340
My computer is on the same device.

27
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,920
The malfunction did not work.

28
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,761
So I've asked for some lights and for us to have a network connection all around the house.

29
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:11,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been asking for this all year.

30
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:11,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even acknowledging it.

31
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually do it through the help desk, you know, that I love.

32
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:13,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

[SPEAKER_07]: th th

Yeah.

38
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm gonna do it anyway though.

39
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:30,983
Okay.

40
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:31,603
Well, you know what he would do?

41
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:32,383
I would go to him and I would tell him.

42
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:33,244
I would tell him, you know what he would do?

43
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,004
Because I'm never supposed to do that.

44
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:34,344
He would do that.

45
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:34,684
He would do that.

46
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:35,684
And when I don't, and they get it, they're like, wow.

47
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:00,801
Yeah.

48
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:32,931
Okay.

49
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:03,258
th th

00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:29,378
Yeah.

00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:29,478
Yeah.

52
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,431
[SPEAKER_07]: but he wouldn't want to be in a relationship with that sort of thing.

53
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:00,011
[SPEAKER_07]: He would not want to do that.

54
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,591
[SPEAKER_07]: He would not want to do that.

55
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:27,752
th th

56
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:57,448
Yeah.

57
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,430
Thank you.

58
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:57,692
Okay.

00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:32,525

62
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,814
[SPEAKER_09]: A regular meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

63
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,055
[SPEAKER_09]: The secretary will call the roll.

64
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:54,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

65
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:22,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of the minutes of the February 11th 2019 meeting.

66
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

67
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:27,969
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

68
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:29,370
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

69
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

70
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of bills.

71
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:33,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Transfer of funds.

72
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:35,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

73
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:36,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

74
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:46,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you for submitting the bills.

75
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:57,107
[SPEAKER_08]: On page 5 of 11, halfway down, it says a person's name, Smith Lena, and it says foreign language textbooks.

76
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be a reimbursement for a purchase.

77
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:00,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

78
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense then.

79
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:14,482
[SPEAKER_08]: On page 7 of 11 and the beginning of 8 of 11, there is a repetitive payment to a person for professional services.

80
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:16,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw it throughout the billing thing.

81
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that an employee, or is that?

82
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:21,286
[SPEAKER_03]: That is for the adult evening school program.

83
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:25,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's paying for professional services in the evening school program.

84
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:29,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Which evening school program would that be?

85
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: The electrical adult learning.

86
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

87
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:46,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that similar with, on page 9 of 11, fourth one up, another employee by the last name of Kirby, and the amount is $1,538?

88
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:53,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That is professional services under a grant for the IDEA.

89
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are contractors, they are not employees.

90
00:22:57,398 --> 00:23:01,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my last question is the last page, second from the last.

91
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:10,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a large amount for McGlynn Middle School miscellaneous items for $5,900.

92
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, these are the student activity accounts that just go through as the warrants, so that is the student activity pass-through.

93
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, it just seems greater than it usually have for that amount.

94
00:23:23,713 --> 00:23:24,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the answers.

95
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:25,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

96
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

97
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:29,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

98
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:31,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote please.

99
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

100
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

101
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:36,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

102
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:38,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

103
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:39,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

104
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

105
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:41,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

106
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to recognize Mr. Rousseau for suspension of the rules.

107
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:46,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'd like to suspend the rules.

108
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:47,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Take a few items out of order.

109
00:23:48,215 --> 00:24:15,333
[SPEAKER_09]: motion for suspension is there a second second for the second on the floor by mr. Benedetto all those in favor aye all those opposed suspension is granted to take papers two and three is there additional and nine two three and nine out of order on the motion all those in favor and ten and ten nine and ten okay

110
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Item two, recognition of Tristan Howard for accomplishments in track and field.

111
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:21,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

112
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:23,794
[SPEAKER_09]: DeLinch, are you present?

113
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:24,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

114
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,699
[SPEAKER_09]: DeLinch, step up to the podium.

115
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:29,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, everybody.

116
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:33,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just myself, but this is Coach Donlan, of course.

117
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:38,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And Coach Dempsey is taking care of his mother-in-law in Florida, where we'd all like to be right now.

118
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:43,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't want to forget Coach Dempsey, who helped us out this year as well.

119
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:46,944
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very special young man here with us.

120
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:52,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been coaching and involved in track and field in Medford for close to 30 years now.

121
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:57,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it doesn't look it, but as an athlete and a coach,

122
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,589
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been very exciting, but it's also quite unique.

123
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:09,936
[SPEAKER_11]: We only have a state champion come through every few years, and we're very fortunate to have one just this past season, and Tristan Howard right here.

124
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:12,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Tristan Howard is here with his very supportive mom.

125
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: His very supportive mom will watch a two minute or three minutes of racing of Tristan on a weekly basis, but remains at the track meet for over six hours.

126
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:32,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Track meets can be quite difficult if you've never had a son or daughter or a younger person in a track meet.

127
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,292
[SPEAKER_11]: They're long, stretched out days, and I appreciate all the support you give Tristan.

128
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:39,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to make it quick.

129
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:43,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, state champions only come through once in a while.

130
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:45,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I've probably coached a dozen of them.

131
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:48,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And this young man is remarkable.

132
00:25:48,697 --> 00:26:01,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank Emily Lazzaro for being patient with our schedule, because once you hear a few things about Tristan, you realize how busy he's been and how difficult it is to get to something like this.

133
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:07,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Just this past, right after the holidays rolling into January, he competed in the East Coast

134
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,413
[SPEAKER_11]: invitational in Providence, Rhode Island.

135
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:15,776
[SPEAKER_11]: He placed second in the 55-meter dash, and he placed third in the 200-meter dash.

136
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:26,424
[SPEAKER_11]: A week later, he entered the Massachusetts State Coaches Association Lodge School invitational, and he placed second in the dash.

137
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:37,492
[SPEAKER_11]: A week later, he goes to our Northeast Conference meet, and not only did he win the dash, he set a new record, a new conference record in the long jump.

138
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

139
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:50,173
[SPEAKER_11]: And the funny thing is, as Coach Joe is reminding me, we only have an outdoor long jump pit.

140
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:51,914
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have an indoor long jump pit.

141
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:59,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's even more remarkable to be a conference champion and set a record in that event, because you can only practice that event outdoors.

142
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:01,776
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so that was wonderful to hear.

143
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:07,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the conclusion of that meet, he was nominated and named unanimously the Northeast

144
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:13,885
[SPEAKER_11]: MVP runner of the year, which is wonderful.

145
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:17,566
[SPEAKER_11]: A week later, he becomes division two state champion.

146
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:23,068
[SPEAKER_11]: He won the 300 meter dash, which he seems to think is a marathon, but it's not.

147
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:34,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Sprinters always try to compare 300 meter dashes and 400 meter dashes as if they're running a full marathon, a half marathon, but he's getting better and better at these distances and it's really remarkable.

148
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he moved on a week later, he went to the New England, just this past weekend.

149
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:51,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, he went to the all-state meet, which means everybody from the eastern part of Massachusetts to the western part of Massachusetts, all five divisions, he finished fourth place amongst everybody in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

150
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:54,387
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not done.

151
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:55,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

152
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:56,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be really quick, Joe.

153
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm almost done.

154
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And now he qualified for the New Englands.

155
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,690
[SPEAKER_11]: And he went on to all the New England states.

156
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,231
[SPEAKER_11]: And he finished eighth place out of all the New England athletes that qualified for the New Englands.

157
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations in the New Englands.

158
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:14,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Coach Joe has the honor of taking him to New York City this weekend for the Nationals.

159
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,174
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty impressive.

160
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:23,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And the best story I can relate it to is when you see a young guy like this or a young lady, and it's been a while.

161
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:28,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do think they make an impression on our community, our high school, our city as a whole.

162
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:35,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And the example I'll give you for that is my younger daughter who is eight and she's been in track and field since she was four.

163
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,156
[SPEAKER_11]: She goes, dad, why are you always at those track meets?

164
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,658
[SPEAKER_11]: You're there all day.

165
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I go, let me show you the kid that's on the team and how fast he is.

166
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So I show her the video clip and then I show her another video clip.

167
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:48,845
[SPEAKER_11]: She looks, she goes, I can beat him.

168
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Her older sister, who's nine, goes, no you can't.

169
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:55,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The cameraman can't even keep up with him.

170
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:56,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the truth.

171
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But I hope you all get to know him.

172
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe's going to add a few more things.

173
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:01,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Wish him luck this weekend.

174
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:03,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We wish you luck this weekend.

175
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:04,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And he'll be racing Friday night in New York City.

176
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,033
[SPEAKER_00]: As if that wasn't enough.

177
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,635
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, I want to talk about something a little bit different.

178
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:20,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I am his coach, but I've actually known Tristan a little bit longer than being his coach.

179
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had him as a student freshman year.

180
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:30,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to talk about why Tristan, in my mind, has been and continues to be one of the model student-athletes here at our school.

181
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:37,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And I firmly believe and have believed for a long time that he is an absolute symbol that we have here as what it means to be a Mustang.

182
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:55,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as proof, and I joked about this, but I think this actually does deserve to be read out loud, this is an email to Mr. Nick Tucci sitting in the back, and this was my nomination for Tristan Howard as a student of the quarter, his freshman year, which he received and won.

183
00:29:56,186 --> 00:30:02,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks a lot about him as a student, and from what I firmly believe, Tristan has stayed on this path ever since.

184
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hi Nick, this is the email.

185
00:30:06,448 --> 00:30:08,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I would like to nominate Tristan Howard as the next student of the month.

186
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:17,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Tristan has been a pleasure to have in my period six world history class, it's an honors class by the way, as well as an impressive leader on our indoor track and field team.

187
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:24,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Already throughout the season, he has shown many commendable qualities that a Mustang athlete should possess.

188
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:26,214
[SPEAKER_00]: He leads by example.

189
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:29,196
[SPEAKER_00]: He strives to overcome adversity.

190
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:32,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably added that because we make him run the relay at the end of our meets too.

191
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,903
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it's not enough that he wins his events, we also put him in other events because we need bodies and he's never said no to me ever.

192
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:46,711
[SPEAKER_00]: He manages his time between academics and athletics and a busy schedule outside of life.

193
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:50,616
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a social student and he works outside too.

194
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,458
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at the Capitol Theater in Arlington.

195
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:57,704
[SPEAKER_00]: So how he has the time to do these things and has continued to have the time to do these things is really impressive.

196
00:30:58,364 --> 00:31:00,485
[SPEAKER_00]: and he remains humble all the while doing so.

197
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:17,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also added, I know this award is recognized for students who excel in the classroom, but I believe that a student like Tristan can be motivation for other students who may see themselves as an athlete or as a student and not someone who can achieve both.

198
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe Tristan has achieved both.

199
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:27,626
[SPEAKER_00]: is continuing to achieve both and is something that we should absolutely recognize him as a student athlete of the highest order.

200
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you.

201
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so Tristan, we have a certificate of appreciation that we'd like to bestow upon you.

202
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:48,076
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Tristan Howard for accomplishments in track and field on behalf of the entire school committee.

203
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:52,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We wish you great success and certainly you're doing it the Mustang way, right Mr. Tucci?

204
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:54,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great work.

205
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,117
Thank you all so much.

206
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,477
Thank you.

207
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:24,148
[SPEAKER_11]: and a great role model for everybody in our community.

208
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:27,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Even my younger children, I can read them.

209
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:30,855
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets other kids, it gets his teammates working and highly motivated.

210
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:34,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot of fun to be around and we appreciate all your hard work.

211
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:35,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice, thank you so much.

212
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,661
[SPEAKER_11]: And his brother was a state champion too.

213
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,843
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you one more thing.

214
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,325
[SPEAKER_11]: He has an older brother, Marcus, he's a shot put thrower.

215
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:44,307
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably outweighs him by about 80 pounds.

216
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:46,889
[SPEAKER_11]: He throws a shot put farther than his older brother.

217
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Very talented man.

218
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:51,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Tristan, do you want to show them what you're going to be running in this weekend?

219
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:59,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So as promised, he can't wear his Medford High School uniform because this is technically a private event.

220
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,112
[SPEAKER_00]: But he still wants to make it known that he's from Medford.

221
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the uniform that he'll be running in.

222
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

223
00:33:04,553 --> 00:33:05,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Designed by his older brother.

224
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:09,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Wear it proudly.

225
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:10,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all very much.

226
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:11,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

227
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:12,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.

228
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:12,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

229
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Item three, report on ethics bowl competition.

230
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:25,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa and Eric, I'm sorry, Eric Asner.

231
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:28,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Eric here?

232
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, how are you?

233
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:51,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here tonight with Mr. Esner, who is a high school English teacher, and we're going to give you a brief description on the accomplishments that our Ethics Bowl team most recently had.

234
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:56,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you that aren't as familiar with the Ethics Bowl team, it is an after-school activity.

235
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,747
[SPEAKER_01]: It began through an initial partnership with the Tufts University Department of Philosophy and the Humanities Department.

236
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:11,051
[SPEAKER_01]: We began in 2013 under the leadership of Mr. Esner and have done very well over the years.

237
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:21,296
[SPEAKER_01]: The premise of an ethics team is designed to cultivate virtues that are central to democratic citizenship.

238
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:22,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the focus.

239
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:26,058
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much debating as it is that analytical piece.

240
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:34,338
[SPEAKER_01]: On February 2nd, our team participated in the New England Regional High School Ethics Bowl competition that Tufts University hosted.

241
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Mr. Esner's guidance, they did very well.

242
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:44,846
[SPEAKER_01]: They outperformed schools such as Phillips Exeter, Phillips Andover, Lexington High School, and beyond.

243
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,287
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fantastic.

244
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:54,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they won that, they were able to participate on February 24th in the semifinal ethics bowl playoff competition.

245
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:58,506
[SPEAKER_01]: they were once again very successful in winning that competition.

246
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:08,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on this victory, they are now invited to the National Ethics Bowl, which is held at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in early April.

247
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:13,639
[SPEAKER_01]: We went one other time, so we're quite excited for this opportunity.

248
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to personally thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work.

249
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:19,043
[SPEAKER_01]: He has come

250
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,352
[SPEAKER_01]: and gone above and beyond with working with the students.

251
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:27,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to also acknowledge the students who are involved.

252
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:32,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, after the national competition, we can invite them down to be recognized.

253
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:45,528
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it includes Maria Carmona, Joshua Kuno, Julia Gallabeck, Shane Ketty, Brendan Meager, Medha Menkerkar, Drexel Osborne, Katie Stephanie, and Jessica Tedito.

254
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:48,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I want to thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work.

255
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:48,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful job.

256
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

257
00:35:53,994 --> 00:36:02,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Also under suspension could someone move item three so we could also make the recommendation to approve the field trip for the Ethics Bowl competition.

258
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve the field trip.

259
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto.

260
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:07,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

261
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:07,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

262
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot?

263
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:08,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

264
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:09,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by Ms.

265
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:09,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot.

266
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:11,704
[SPEAKER_09]: All the roll call vote please.

267
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:12,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Member DiBenedetto.

268
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:16,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Member DiBenedetto.

269
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:16,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

270
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz.

271
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:18,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

272
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Mustone.

273
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:19,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

274
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:19,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruggiero.

275
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:19,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

276
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

277
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:22,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

278
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:23,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van der Kloot.

279
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:24,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

280
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:24,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burr.

281
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:25,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

282
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

283
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:27,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

284
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:28,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

285
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:30,024
[SPEAKER_09]: That's such an accomplishment.

286
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,925
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just so, so proud of you and the team.

287
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:33,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

288
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about the funding.

289
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:47,231
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time when the students went to the Ethics Bowl, we were able, if I recall, to get a contributor to cover the costs of the student's trip.

290
00:36:48,611 --> 00:37:03,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at this point, I would like to ask the mayor on behalf of the school committee if you could see if we could get a donor to cover the cost, as you've been successful in the past.

291
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:05,555
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

292
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:07,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make every attempt.

293
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:08,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

294
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be much appreciated.

295
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the approval as well.

296
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:11,657
[SPEAKER_09]: We wish you great success.

297
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:12,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

298
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:12,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

299
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:23,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, while under suspension, item nine, report on Scholastic Writing Awards.

300
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Chiesa?

301
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,421
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

302
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:31,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving to the English department, putting the English hat on for a minute.

303
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:34,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited to share with you

304
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,996
[SPEAKER_01]: the good news of our accomplishments with the Scholastic Writing Awards.

305
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:40,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you are familiar with this.

306
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:49,465
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, there were over 2,600 applicants, and I'm pleased to announce that Medford had three Scholastic Writing Awards silver key recipients.

307
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:52,268
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one middle school winner.

308
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:54,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her tonight how proud I was.

309
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,993
[SPEAKER_01]: She's representing all the middle schools, so competition was fierce.

310
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,873
[SPEAKER_01]: and Medford still prevailed very nicely.

311
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:12,730
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, the School of Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University was partnering with Boston Globe, which is a difference from the past, but still the awards were offered to grades seven through 12.

312
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:28,777
[SPEAKER_01]: The categories, as you can see from the report, included dramatic script, poetry, memoir, critical essay, and there were specific rubrics to grade those, including the use of voice, originality, and such.

313
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:40,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Every winner will receive a certificate for the award, and the silver key recipients will be honored at Tufts University, which is very exciting, at a later date in March.

314
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,143
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really proud of them for their hard work.

315
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:49,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to thank the teachers who wanted to be here tonight, but I know they had a few other commitments.

316
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mr. Ambrose, Ms.

317
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:53,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanford, Mr. Bowen Flynn, Ms.

318
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:58,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Zeckman at the middle school played a very large role in that as well.

319
00:38:58,662 --> 00:38:59,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to them.

320
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:03,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe you have the certificates to honor.

321
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:03,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

322
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:04,945
[SPEAKER_08]: DiBenedetto.

323
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:05,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

324
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:11,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if you could send us a copy of the winning essays and poems.

325
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,510
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to see those as well.

326
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:28,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I failed to mention that after we have the parents sign off a permission slip, and the student in case that the piece is personal to them, we like the sign offs from those, we also publish them on the English Department website.

327
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:31,619
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will try to email you as well your own copy of it.

328
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

329
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

330
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:33,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

331
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Certificate of Achievement, Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Isabelle Anglici for receiving the Scholastic Writing Award, Silver Key.

332
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,352
[SPEAKER_01]: She couldn't make it tonight.

333
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:45,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

334
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:51,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Laurel Baxter for receiving the Scholastic Writing Award, Silver Key.

335
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:09,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Danara Torres for receiving the Silver Key, Elastic Writing Award.

336
00:40:09,468 --> 00:40:10,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

337
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

338
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

339
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:23,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, while we're under suspension, the Scholastic Art Awards.

340
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:28,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Szczynski.

341
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

342
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:44,145
[SPEAKER_12]: In conjunction with the Scholastic Awards, we had three Medford High School students receive Scholastic Art Awards in recognition of their superior work in various media.

343
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:51,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Each year the Scholastic Program introduces the greater Boston community to a new generation of young artistic talent.

344
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:58,816
[SPEAKER_12]: These awards, recognizing the important educational value of the arts, send a significant message to these young people.

345
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:05,363
[SPEAKER_12]: They acknowledge that the creative achievement in the visual arts and the ideas of our students are valued and celebrated.

346
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,971
[SPEAKER_12]: The visual arts are judged in 17 categories with specific requirements for each.

347
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:18,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Judges look for work that demonstrates originality, technical skill, and the emergence of a personal voice or vision.

348
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:25,614
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Nicole mentioned, the regional awards are sponsored by the Boston Globe and the School of Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts.

349
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,054
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had three winners.

350
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:33,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Kylie Trong received two honorable mention awards for her photography.

351
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,798
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a senior, extremely talented young lady.

352
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:42,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only did she excel in art, she's in the high school orchestra, plays violin.

353
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:48,301
[SPEAKER_12]: She has done an incredible job working on the yearbook this year.

354
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:51,702
[SPEAKER_12]: When that comes out, I know everybody's gonna be impressed.

355
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's also on the swim team, which is where she is tonight.

356
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:55,763
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a swim team event.

357
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,203
[SPEAKER_12]: So, congratulations to her.

358
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Katherine Schmidt is here.

359
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:13,916
[SPEAKER_12]: And another very talented young lady, because she is not only a cellist in the high school orchestra, but she has great artistic skills, and she won a silver key in drawing and illustration.

360
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:18,799
[SPEAKER_12]: She's only a freshman, so gold key, I think, is in the future.

361
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:28,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And she will also be performing with the MMA Junior District Orchestra at the end of this month.

362
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:31,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So, again, another multi-talented person.

363
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:54,999
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, Cairo Keenan, who's a junior, received a Gold Key Award for his digital art entitled Greenhouse, and that will be on display at Tufts University starting on March 16th, and is currently being judged with the other Gold Key regional awards in New York on the national level.

364
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:59,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure Cairo was here either, but Catherine is here.

365
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:12,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also like to acknowledge, Catherine is a student of Ms.

366
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Van Aken, who is here tonight.

367
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:15,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And Cairo.

368
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And Cairo is a student of Ms.

369
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobrega, who is here tonight.

370
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:25,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

371
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

372
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

373
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

374
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:30,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to take these, Mr. Zigney?

375
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:31,155
[SPEAKER_09]: For these other two?

376
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:32,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

377
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:50,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there another recommendation?

378
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:56,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

379
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for item 8?

380
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

381
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to take item 8 while we're in suspension.

382
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

383
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:08,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve field trip, DECA vocational student trip to Boston.

384
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:16,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Madam Superintendent, Superintendent Maurice, and committee.

385
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having us.

386
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:24,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really going to leave it up to our instructor and our student who are here tonight, but we are seeking approval.

387
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:27,066
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be our third year attending this event.

388
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:29,748
[SPEAKER_13]: This is for the DECA state competition.

389
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,849
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be the third year that we have students qualifying for the nationals, so we're very proud of that.

390
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:39,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We're seeking approval for the trip, which will be in Boston, staying over Thursday night.

391
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we've done this in the past.

392
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so you have an idea, the total cost of the trip was just around $2,800.

393
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:50,413
[SPEAKER_13]: $600 was raised through fundraising events, and about $825 was contributed through students and their families towards payment of the hotel.

394
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:57,117
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'd like to do is introduce Ms.

395
00:44:57,157 --> 00:45:01,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Kristin Kuhlen, our senior student, Hunter Tognarelli.

396
00:45:02,524 --> 00:45:02,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

397
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:05,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Kuhlen is our business tech and marketing education instructor.

398
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:11,435
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been part of DECA during all of her time here, but this year she took on the role as the advisor full-time.

399
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,617
[SPEAKER_13]: It should also be mentioned that Ms.

400
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:19,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Coolen took on both programs, both business tech and marketing, as our other instructor resigned last year.

401
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,422
[SPEAKER_13]: She's done an amazing job.

402
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:28,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, we have the highest amount of freshmen this year who chose this program, so much so that we will be looking probably for another teacher next year or halfway through next year, depending on our numbers.

403
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:32,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Hunter Tognarelli is in grade 12.

404
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:33,914
[SPEAKER_13]: He's competing again.

405
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:37,677
[SPEAKER_13]: He is a student who's participating in our cooperative education program.

406
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:41,301
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the two of them could give you a short explanation of this event.

407
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,103
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to bring the two of these people up here now.

408
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:44,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

409
00:45:49,157 --> 00:45:49,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

410
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:53,200
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my first school committee, so I'm a little nervous.

411
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:57,724
[SPEAKER_06]: DECA is a competition for business students.

412
00:45:57,984 --> 00:46:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes role plays, written activities, presentations.

413
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:07,452
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our third year where we have international qualifiers in a row.

414
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:10,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite an accomplishment.

415
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:11,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We have

416
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:14,678
[SPEAKER_06]: teams that have been doing this competition for decades.

417
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:16,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are hundreds of members.

418
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So for our little group of 10 to make it not only to states, but to internationals each year has made our whole program very proud of each other.

419
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We've worked very hard.

420
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year, in order to qualify for internationals, the students had to build a 35 to 40 page

421
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:42,537
[SPEAKER_06]: student-based enterprise report.

422
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an operations manual.

423
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:48,322
[SPEAKER_06]: They spent many hours, many 2 a.m.

424
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:48,842
[SPEAKER_06]: emails.

425
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:57,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So we submitted with the hopes of at least getting bronze, and we ended up getting gold rating on our work.

426
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So the students did an excellent job on that.

427
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ready to present at States this year.

428
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:08,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll present on the market planning portion of the report.

429
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they're excited to be doing that.

430
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,063
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be doing that on Friday.

431
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is more of a test run.

432
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the states are asking the SBE qualifiers to present and kind of get a little bit of practice in before the internationals.

433
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:28,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're hoping.

434
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,563
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping to win one.

435
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,664
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping to win one.

436
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:48,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So Hunter's part of the team, not only did Hunter qualify for the SBE manual portion, but he also qualified making second place out of I think 25 competitors for his role play exercise as well.

437
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And another student who's participating, he not only worked tirelessly on the SBE manual, but he qualified as well.

438
00:47:59,265 --> 00:48:02,568
[SPEAKER_06]: second place, I think, too, as well, in his role play activity.

439
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're having some great success, and I'd like to keep that going.

440
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:12,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And the program is being recognized a lot for DECA.

441
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: The students are very, very engaged in this.

442
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:21,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're looking, they're, how do I want to say this?

443
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:28,527
[SPEAKER_06]: They're excited to join the business program because of the DECA competition.

444
00:48:28,587 --> 00:48:32,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would definitely like to see us there every year.

445
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

446
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job.

447
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:34,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

448
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:40,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like Hunter to say a few words on why he participates.

449
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:59,712

[SPEAKER_18]: Last year we all made it to states so that was an awesome experience and then this year we made it to states and we're making it to nationals and I think I've been saying this in class like every day it's like we're like the Patriots you know like we're like the Patriots like three straight years of going to nationals like that's unreal.

451
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:23,752
[SPEAKER_18]: We have like five or six people starting off, like my sophomore year we only had like four kids in DECA, and half of us made it to nationals.

452

[SPEAKER_18]: It's on me.

456
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:56,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone wants to do it because everyone knows that if you want to have a good experience and you want to have something to talk about when you're growing up,

457
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:03,836
[SPEAKER_18]: when you go for a job, right?

00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:14,122
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's also an amazing experience.

465
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:18,544
[SPEAKER_18]: How many high school kids can say, hey, I got to go to nationals for a business program.

466
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:21,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to do a presentation that I really care about.

467
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:25,408
[SPEAKER_18]: And we started this whole program last year, the actual SBE manual.

468
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:26,249
[SPEAKER_18]: We started it.

00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,450
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Mustang Travels.

470
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,531
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about how we rent out cars

[SPEAKER_18]: Vans, minibuses, little smaller vans as well.

473
00:50:37,558 --> 00:50:40,000
[SPEAKER_18]: And people can take it off for field trips and stuff like that.

474
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,444
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's really cool that like our hard work is kind of being appreciated.

475
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:45,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

476
00:50:45,954 --> 00:50:47,155

00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:56,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Not sure where.

482
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can imagine that the growth of DECA has something to do with you, too.

483
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:00,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

484
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,432

00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:20,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you remember.

491
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,940

00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I was shopping at the store and I took a long time.

493
00:51:25,943 --> 00:51:27,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I was posting pitches.

494
00:51:27,224 --> 00:51:29,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying on all different types of merchandise.

495
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:30,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember?

496
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:31,806

00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:34,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there and it was so great.

498
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:43,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage everybody in the community to buy some of the outfits that they have at the vocational school.

499
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I love them.

500
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:49,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I wear them every Saturday, everywhere I go.

501
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially the sweatpants with the little zip at the bottom.

502
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:55,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So comfy.

503
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:57,235
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like pajamas you can wear outside.

504
00:51:57,275 --> 00:52:04,497
[SPEAKER_08]: In the half zip pullover that says Medford, in the red t-shirt, because we had to search for the right color.

505
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And the red one really pops.

506
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't sure at first.

507
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:13,679
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm telling you, I spent a long, long time with Hunter and a wonderful teacher.

[SPEAKER_08]: I learned a lot.

510
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:19,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And the program is expanding.

[SPEAKER_08]: I have great ideas.

512
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:28,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Your number on my bulletin board at home, so that way I can tell everybody where to go and how to get there.

513
00:52:28,364 --> 00:52:30,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for all your service, and keep selling.

680
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:07,531
[SPEAKER_14]: As elected members of the school committee, we should always engage in civil discourse.

681
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:11,011

[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

715
01:03:59,178 --> 01:03:59,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz.

716
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:03,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, so we had another Rules Subcommittee on February 25th.

717
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:09,092
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of our meeting was to discuss the Medford Public Schools Responsible Use Policy.

718
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:11,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we did was we discussed

719
01:04:12,497 --> 01:04:29,537
[SPEAKER_14]: what items in the policy that maybe needed additional professional development, and we also asked Molly Ladin, who is the director of technology, if the rules that are posted on the website are officially

720
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:32,011
[SPEAKER_14]: updated and they are up to date.

721
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:39,737
[SPEAKER_14]: We did ask to switch out, there's a URL and the URL says acceptable use policy.

722
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:42,579
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the document says responsible use.

723
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,200
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've asked for that update.

724
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,922
[SPEAKER_14]: We did, Mr. Russo asked if

725
01:04:47,402 --> 01:04:50,985
[SPEAKER_14]: A blacklist could be imposed to block out social media networks.

726
01:04:52,626 --> 01:04:58,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Superintendent Edouard-Vincent cautioned that social media sites like YouTube can be educational.

727
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:02,955
[SPEAKER_14]: The district uses social media, so it's difficult to prohibit.

728
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:09,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also do a lot of updates to notify our community about what's happening in the community.

729
01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:13,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just need to use guidance versus restriction.

730
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:20,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, we just wanted to reiterate that Instagram is an account

731
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:29,637
[SPEAKER_14]: that should not be open for under, I'm sorry, I'm just tired, for account for 13 years under 13 years old.

732
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:32,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I'm getting tired.

733
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:34,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, Ms.

734
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:40,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladin, she mentioned that each year the responsible use policy is discussed with the new staff at the beginning of school.

735
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:45,747
[SPEAKER_14]: The Children's Internet Protection Act says that social media is not banned.

736
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:46,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

737
01:05:46,687 --> 01:05:49,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladin notes that there are no protections out there.

738
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,873
[SPEAKER_14]: We just need to educate and make whatever you're posting as private as you can.

739
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:58,737
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're under 13 years old, the students should not be using social media.

740
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,760
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the parents that attended, Ms.

741
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:08,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Todfeld, brought up some concerns about using Instagram for submitting homework assignments in middle school.

742
01:06:08,926 --> 01:06:13,570
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't safe because there is an explore button that cannot be turned off.

743
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:19,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo noted that Instagram can be accessed via the website or the app.

744
01:06:19,774 --> 01:06:25,018
[SPEAKER_14]: It's open to the worldwide web, and that's why it's a little dangerous for that, you know, that group of students.

745
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:25,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

746
01:06:25,758 --> 01:06:32,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Latin said that there must be an educational reason for, you know, teachers in classrooms to get the technology tool.

747
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:35,345
[SPEAKER_14]: All software must be approved by the technology department.

748
01:06:36,146 --> 01:06:38,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Google Classrooms is a safe product.

749
01:06:38,547 --> 01:06:41,589
[SPEAKER_14]: It's closed, and external emails are not allowed K to 8.

750
01:06:42,658 --> 01:06:47,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Superintendent Dr. Vincent noted that technology and education go hand in hand.

751
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:54,390
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to remind the middle school's administration and teachers social media sites like Instagram are not legal for students under 13.

752
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, we must consider students' access.

753
01:06:57,432 --> 01:07:02,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Some don't have computers or devices, so they can't access the material to submit their homework.

754
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:04,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

755
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:08,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Taubville would like to see more education for teachers and administrators.

756
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Social media is addictive by nature.

757
01:07:11,703 --> 01:07:16,086
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to be smart, savvy, and wait a little longer to introduce students to social media.

758
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:16,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

759
01:07:16,906 --> 01:07:24,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell noted that it's top priority to discuss with teachers and administrators at the upcoming meetings and provide additional professional development.

760
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:25,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

761
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:29,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladin informed us that everything in the building is monitored and archived.

762
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:31,455
[SPEAKER_14]: All emails can be recovered,

763
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:34,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Student logins begin at 6th grade.

764
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:38,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo asked if there's filtering to block sites, and there is.

765
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:39,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Ms.

766
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:40,718

767
01:07:41,238 --> 01:07:46,900
[SPEAKER_14]: The meeting ended with just adding a responsible use of, oh, with adding the date, left that word out.

768
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:53,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, there's just going to be a review every two years and currently is up to date, so there's no updates that are necessary.

769
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:54,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And our meeting adjourned.

770
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:55,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

771
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:56,343

790
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:17,114
[SPEAKER_16]: nine course meal, Japanese lunch, and learned about the Japanese culture today.

791
01:09:17,955 --> 01:09:20,578
[SPEAKER_16]: They could not have been more welcoming to all of us.

792
01:09:21,019 --> 01:09:23,582
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were very appreciative of that opportunity.

[SPEAKER_16]: The program is a big hit with the students.

806
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,928

[SPEAKER_16]: The McGlynn Middle School CCSR hosted a food drive the week of February 11th, led by 8th graders Sejean Maguire, Glorine Vixama, Saica Correales, and 7th grader Elijah Buttello.

808
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:12,866
[SPEAKER_16]: After researching local food pantries, they chose to send their donations to the Somerville Homeless Coalition.

809
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:22,634
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a local organization that provides homeless and near homeless individuals and families in the Somerville and Boston area with support.

814
01:11:53,356 --> 01:12:04,725
[SPEAKER_16]: So we just want to recognize that hard work and that Medford's now going to be banning plastic bags, which is important for our environment.

815
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,626

823
01:12:51,397 --> 01:13:01,387
[SPEAKER_16]: When coach Jason Nascimento decided not to return as a Mustang football coach to spend more time with his growing family, we established a committee to seek his replacement.

824
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:07,469
[SPEAKER_16]: That committee completed thorough screenings of 20 applicants for the position.

[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to extend a sincere thanks to Coach Nascimento for his 10 years of dedicated service to the football program.

832
01:14:17,978 --> 01:14:21,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Coach Nascimento, and welcome, Coach Curley.

833

834
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:39,461
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a flyer in the back of your packets.

835
01:14:40,462 --> 01:14:45,383
[SPEAKER_16]: As we are all aware, concussions are no longer a simple bump on the head or bell ringers.

836
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:53,725
[SPEAKER_16]: It is our job to keep young athletes protected by better understanding the symptoms, treatment, and prevention of concussions.

837
01:14:54,245 --> 01:15:06,468
[SPEAKER_16]: The Massachusetts Concussion Management Coalition, MCMC, will provide the training to learn more about the recognition, prevention, care, and management of sports-related concussions.

838
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,089
[SPEAKER_16]: So all are invited.

839
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:21,358
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford Vocational Technical High School sophomore cosmetology students are learning wet styling, which is featured on the Massachusetts State Board of Cosmetology licensing exam.

840
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:28,001
[SPEAKER_16]: This timeless method of hairstyling is commonly used to create big and glamorous Hollywood hair.

841
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:34,363
[SPEAKER_16]: So the students put their new skills to work by paying tribute to the Academy Awards.

842
01:15:35,183 --> 01:15:38,805
[SPEAKER_16]: The students were randomly assigned a celebrity hairstyle to recreate.

843
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:47,679
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition, combining academics with shop, they also wrote a short biography on their Academy Award winner.

844
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:55,588
[SPEAKER_16]: The graphics program produced the clapper board signs so students could record their projects for display.

845
01:15:57,317 --> 01:16:05,440
[SPEAKER_16]: The display was in the cosmetology program room on a red carpet covered table with Academy Award trophies in between the students' work.

846
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:22,606
[SPEAKER_16]: The students recreated the hairstyles of Julia Roberts, Joan Crawford, Betty Davis, Reese Witherspoon, Catherine Hepburn, Louise Fletcher, Elizabeth Taylor, Emma Stone, Julie Andrews, Viola Davis, Ginger Rogers, Cher,

848
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:33,248
[SPEAKER_16]: The students were very proud to show off their projects.

849
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:35,089
[SPEAKER_16]: And I went down to look at it.

850
01:16:35,309 --> 01:16:39,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And they had the pictures and the mannequin heads.

851
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:40,930
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were really excited.

852
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,811
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was wonderful.

853
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:48,832
[SPEAKER_16]: And other students were coming down to look at the work that the students had done.

854
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:50,592
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was a great project.

855
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,033
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was really proud of their work.

856
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:56,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, vocational side news.

857
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:58,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to announce that Ms.

858
01:16:58,977 --> 01:17:12,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Alice Beth Fitzpatrick has been appointed interim assistant director, principal for the Medford Vocational Technical High School, replacing Jill Sawyer, who left the district for another position.

859
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:17,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Alice Beth has been a guidance Councilor for the Medford Public Schools for the past 12 years.

860
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:21,571
[SPEAKER_16]: She will be at our next meeting, presenting with Principal Fallon,

861
01:17:21,991 --> 01:17:25,593
[SPEAKER_16]: We are excited to welcome her aboard onto the administrative team.

862
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:29,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, this is more vocational news.

863
01:17:30,456 --> 01:17:35,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week, I actually used the services offered by our automotive shop.

864
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:39,581
[SPEAKER_16]: My car's tire sensor light had to be adjusted.

865
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:44,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I was driving and the sensor had come on and I said, you know what?

866
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:47,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And everyone said, go bring it over to the vocational shop.

867
01:17:47,652 --> 01:17:48,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So I did.

868
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:54,119
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were able to inspect my car, change my inspection sticker,

869
01:17:55,531 --> 01:18:01,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And in addition, repair the sensor damage that I wasn't aware of.

870
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:03,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I just could see it showing up on the car.

871
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:07,039
[SPEAKER_16]: So while I was there, I got to spend time with the students.

872
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:13,964
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, the students at that time were asking me, why hadn't we had a snow day?

873
01:18:15,785 --> 01:18:18,888
[SPEAKER_16]: They were, the pressure was on.

874
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:31,341
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to say that when they did do the first check of my car, and they took care of the sticker, they did end up finding out that I also had a nail in my tire.

875
01:18:32,161 --> 01:18:47,721
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I was really surprised and so pleased that here on the Medford High School campus, you can bring your car for service, have it served by students, and they found a nail and they repaired the nail the following day.

876
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:50,765
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want the community to know, you know,

877
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Come to Medford Vocational High School.

878
01:18:54,168 --> 01:18:57,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Get your inspection sticker done for your car, your brakes.

879
01:18:57,811 --> 01:18:59,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Get nails taken out of your tires.

880
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:01,274
[SPEAKER_16]: They can fix sensors.

881
01:19:01,555 --> 01:19:02,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab some lunch.

882
01:19:02,736 --> 01:19:03,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

883
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Come and eat in the bistro and have a wonderful meal.

884
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,502
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot that we are offering.

885
01:19:09,562 --> 01:19:10,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your hair done.

886
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:12,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, you can.

887
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:14,907
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go to the Mustang Mall and go shopping.

888
01:19:14,987 --> 01:19:15,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

889
01:19:16,288 --> 01:19:20,152
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I owe them a visit, so I'll say that.

890
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:35,286
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to also just note that while I was in the automotive shop, I was pleased to see female students because normally it's traditionally a male pathway, or that's the way kind of society had set it up.

891
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:36,828
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were three students.

892
01:19:37,508 --> 01:19:41,992
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the students that I asked, Veronica, I said, well, what do you like doing on cars?

893
01:19:42,052 --> 01:19:43,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And she said, I like brakes.

894
01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:45,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So she likes changing brakes.

895
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought it was wonderful.

896
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:48,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was wonderful.

897
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:48,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

898
01:19:48,877 --> 01:19:49,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

899
01:19:50,058 --> 01:19:51,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Kindergarten registration.

900
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,841
[SPEAKER_16]: So our little ones are coming on board.

901
01:19:53,941 --> 01:19:56,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Kindergarten registration officially started yesterday.

902
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,925
[SPEAKER_16]: at the Parent Information Center.

903
01:19:59,445 --> 01:20:04,089
[SPEAKER_16]: So the forms can now be downloaded from our website.

904
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:07,492
[SPEAKER_16]: However, all registrations must be made in person.

905
01:20:08,113 --> 01:20:16,781
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first of three Building Bridges to Kindergarten informational presentations will be held this Thursday, tomorrow evening at 7 p.m.

906
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:18,863
[SPEAKER_16]: in the library of Medford High School.

907
01:20:20,522 --> 01:20:27,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, the If They Had Known presentation is being held on two different nights for parents.

908
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:34,111
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a 35-minute film that focuses on the risks of current party culture.

909
01:20:34,851 --> 01:20:36,732
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not a film about addiction.

910
01:20:37,553 --> 01:20:48,260
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a candid film spoken by kids, two kids, about the risks of recreationally mixing prescription drugs with alcohol.

911
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:52,581
[SPEAKER_16]: The film is an honest and emotional account of a real event.

912
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:58,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Parents of all schools are cordially invited to attend one of these presentations.

913
01:20:59,382 --> 01:21:02,142
[SPEAKER_16]: The film will be followed by a question and answer session.

914
01:21:02,843 --> 01:21:15,605
[SPEAKER_16]: It will be presented at the McGlynn Middle School tomorrow evening, Thursday, March 7th at 7 o'clock and next Thursday, March 14th at the Karen Theater at Medford High School.

915
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:30,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to thank Tony Vento, our director of health services, and Rachel Perry, our assistant director of health education, for bringing this important topic of discussion to our district.

916
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:35,811
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a great opportunity and I hope many families are able to take advantage of it.

917
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:44,009
[SPEAKER_16]: So both of our middle schools are now featuring lunch with the principals, and I just wanted to highlight that.

918
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:49,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Principal Downs hosts lunch each month with six students from each grade.

919
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:57,261
[SPEAKER_16]: These students are selected by their teachers and eat lunch with Mr. Downs in his conference room.

920
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:01,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Principal Downs believes it is a great way for him to learn more about his students.

921
01:22:03,506 --> 01:22:10,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Likewise, Principal Nick Tucci also hosts lunch each month with students who are Mustang Way role models.

922
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:15,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Tucci selects a student a week, and at the end of the month, they all have lunch together.

923
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:29,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I love this idea because the principals are reaching their students in all different ways, and rewarding their examples of leadership, responsibility, and respect, which is truly the Mustang Way.

924
01:22:32,086 --> 01:22:40,876
[SPEAKER_16]: A reminder again to save your dates, save the date, mark your calendars for Friday, April 5, 2019 from 8 a.m.

925
01:22:40,976 --> 01:22:41,797
[SPEAKER_16]: to 1 p.m.

926
01:22:42,197 --> 01:22:48,764
[SPEAKER_16]: That's our second annual Credit for Life Financial Literacy Fair, which will be held here in the gym.

927
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,347
[SPEAKER_16]: The fair is for the junior class.

928
01:22:52,428 --> 01:22:58,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And this fair began last year with a $5,000 grant from State Treasurer Deb Goldberg's office.

929
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:04,418
[SPEAKER_16]: The State Treasurer just approved Medford High for a $2,500 grant for this year's event.

930
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:15,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I have heard from many people that last year's event was a great success, and I can't wait to witness it this year.

931
01:23:16,584 --> 01:23:31,249
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee preparing the fair are Director of Curriculum, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Assistant Principal, Gail Trainor, and Medford Vocational Teacher, Marketing Teacher, Kristen Kulin, who was just here.

932
01:23:32,589 --> 01:23:37,031
[SPEAKER_16]: and our PR person, Lisa Evangelista, helping out with this event.

933
01:23:37,672 --> 01:23:46,076
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, math teachers have added financial literacy to their curriculum so students are even better prepared for the fair.

934
01:23:46,776 --> 01:23:50,378
[SPEAKER_16]: All of you are welcome to attend on April 5th, so please save that date.

935
01:23:51,099 --> 01:23:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: What time was it?

936
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:53,260
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from 8 a.m.

937
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,521
[SPEAKER_16]: to 1 p.m.

938
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:55,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

939
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:56,361
[SPEAKER_05]: On a Friday.

940
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:57,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Friday, April 5th, 2019.

941
01:24:01,844 --> 01:24:10,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, on last Friday, the West Medford Community Center, it hosts First Friday Words in Music.

942
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:19,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And with March being Women's History Month, I was asked to attend and participate in a Facebook Live program.

943
01:24:19,815 --> 01:24:23,598
[SPEAKER_16]: I was interviewed for about an hour about my childhood in Medford,

944
01:24:24,163 --> 01:24:28,304
[SPEAKER_16]: my educational background, and how I came to love the world of education.

945
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:34,646
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Mayor Burke and member Paulette Van der Kloot for attending last week.

946
01:24:35,366 --> 01:24:38,527
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are my updates from Medford, and thank you for listening.

947
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:39,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

948
01:24:39,428 --> 01:24:40,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Oshiro.

949
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:44,669
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd just like to know a little bit about the Massachusetts Coalition for the Management of Concussions.

950
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:45,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

951
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's going to, is there a neurologist going to be presenting at that event?

952
01:24:50,011 --> 01:24:52,972
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have, I'm sorry.

953
01:24:53,112 --> 01:24:53,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, excuse me.

954
01:24:55,048 --> 01:25:03,051
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't have who all of the presenters are going to be, but I can definitely get that information to you probably by tomorrow.

955
01:25:03,652 --> 01:25:04,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay?

956
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:12,155
[SPEAKER_16]: But it is an informative event, and I'm not sure if they'll have neurologists, but it will definitely be informative for us to learn more about that.

957
01:25:13,716 --> 01:25:14,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

958
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:16,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

959
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:19,578
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no real reports out yet.

960
01:25:20,038 --> 01:25:21,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, item five.

961
01:25:22,741 --> 01:25:25,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Ratification of Kids' Corner Memorandum of Agreement.

962
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:34,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an executive session two weeks ago.

963
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:40,774
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a motion for approval of the Kids' Corner Agreement and this is taking it to the floor to formally adopt it.

964
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Ms.

965
01:25:43,236 --> 01:25:45,036

[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rosero.

974
01:25:49,718 --> 01:25:49,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

976
01:25:50,799 --> 01:25:51,039

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

981
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,621
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

982
01:25:54,661 --> 01:25:55,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

983
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Ratification has occurred.

984
01:25:57,762 --> 01:26:00,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Also item 6, ratification of Secretary's Memorandum of Agreement.

985
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,084
[SPEAKER_09]: This was the same thing.

986
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:04,185
[SPEAKER_09]: This was in our executive session of the last meeting.

987
01:26:04,385 --> 01:26:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion of approval.

988
01:26:05,926 --> 01:26:06,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval, Ms.

989
01:26:06,826 --> 01:26:07,686

01:26:07,726 --> 01:26:08,026

[SPEAKER_04]: Member Di Benedetto.

993
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:10,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

994
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:20,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

995
01:26:20,411 --> 01:26:21,091
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 in the affirmative.

996
01:26:21,271 --> 01:26:21,752
[SPEAKER_09]: 0 in the negative.

997
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:22,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

998
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 7, review of MSBA statement of interest for April filing deadline.

999
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:27,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1000
01:26:27,694 --> 01:26:28,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson.

1001
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:31,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

1002
01:26:31,955 --> 01:26:36,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the same process that we went through last fiscal year.

1003
01:26:36,677 --> 01:26:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: They open up the accelerated projects.

1004
01:26:40,378 --> 01:27:04,808
[SPEAKER_03]: the first of the year in January and this is for a core project which we are applying for the high school building here and this is the wording that we administration has reviewed again for its content and to ensure that we have equal chance to be accepted into the MSBA program.

1005
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:19,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a time constraint where we do need to have this document, the wording that it is provided here, as well as getting City Council approval upon your approval, if you so desire.

1006
01:27:19,799 --> 01:27:20,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1007
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:23,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson, if I could just ask one question from the Chair.

1008
01:27:23,562 --> 01:27:27,765
[SPEAKER_09]: On page two, you mentioned the Everett Agreement.

1009
01:27:28,305 --> 01:27:28,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1010
01:27:29,186 --> 01:27:31,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And you project an increase in enrollment of 100.

1011
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:33,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you believe that that is still accurate?

1012
01:27:34,903 --> 01:27:36,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our initial projection.

1013
01:27:37,245 --> 01:27:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: We can certainly revise that before moving forward.

1014
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1015
01:27:40,668 --> 01:27:45,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should just reevaluate how that's looking and what you think the true numbers would be.

1016
01:27:45,613 --> 01:27:45,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1017
01:27:46,233 --> 01:28:01,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And also based upon our lunch today that we had with the Japanese consulate as well as members of the Japanese learning school that use our facility on Saturday, we spoke about this process and they were very excited about it as well and they thought if there's anything we can add to incorporate

1018
01:28:02,347 --> 01:28:10,214
[SPEAKER_09]: what their school does here as well, that could really beef up our application, that we should consider that as well.

1019
01:28:11,475 --> 01:28:14,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo?

1020
01:28:14,297 --> 01:28:23,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to see, and maybe I've missed it, but I see the mention of an improved cafeteria, but what about the library?

1021
01:28:25,415 --> 01:28:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So library spaces are not part of what the core program looks at in terms of renovation improvements.

1022
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:41,878
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at specific criteria, so that's why these are numbered and it's specific to the application itself.

1023
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:54,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did not include the library just as focusing on the urgent needs for HVAC systems, a roof, other areas that are

1024
01:28:56,515 --> 01:29:03,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdated in the context of security measures, leaks, roofs, things of that nature.

1025
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:08,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was not included as part of the original submittal.

1026
01:29:08,538 --> 01:29:12,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just were moving forward with what we had.

1027
01:29:12,799 --> 01:29:17,260
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was something specific for consideration, we can look to see if it may fit.

1028
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the core areas that are part of the application.

1029
01:29:21,741 --> 01:29:25,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But under number seven, the cafeteria is part?

1030
01:29:27,441 --> 01:29:43,712
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of enabling more students to be in the section at the same time, to be able to serve students in one area versus three, three different levels, that was the intent for this original submittal.

1031
01:29:44,127 --> 01:30:01,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm reflecting back a couple of years when we submitted but unfortunately were not chosen for renovation of the whole library area and that that's not a piece of either this or the funds we spoke about earlier this evening in subcommittee.

1032
01:30:02,327 --> 01:30:03,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there were other

1033
01:30:04,049 --> 01:30:08,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Other parts, I don't recall them off of hand, but they were very detailed at the time.

1034
01:30:09,172 --> 01:30:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was surprised not to see it as a piece of this.

1035
01:30:13,895 --> 01:30:26,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd sort of like to look back at some of the plans at that time to see where we are, because not to even be considering it at this point would seem unfortunate.

1036
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:32,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of what is acceptable, then I would make a motion for approval.

1037
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:54,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have to make those changes and That can we mend it to make sure that this paper reflects the amount of students from a proper number Yes, we make that as an amendment to approval of this item also

1038
01:30:56,469 --> 01:31:00,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to request an update on that fact.

1039
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,128
[SPEAKER_08]: How many outside students we actually have coming in from different districts?

1040
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:08,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please.

1041
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:23,362
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that miss Patterson amend this filing to incorporate actual projections for the Everett partnership and motion for approval I Don't think we needed to come back to us.

1042
01:31:23,402 --> 01:31:29,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we agreed that if she meant the number we're good to go So motion for approval has been offered roll call vote, please Yes Yes

1043
01:31:37,172 --> 01:31:39,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1044
01:31:40,014 --> 01:31:48,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, a B paper to this is to request a report that shows all of the outside enrollment at each of our schools.

1045
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would include Curtis Tufts Vocational School.

1046
01:31:51,262 --> 01:31:55,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe those would be the only two, but if there are any others, please incorporate that as well.

1047
01:31:56,366 --> 01:31:56,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1048
01:31:56,807 --> 01:31:57,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1049
01:31:57,307 --> 01:31:57,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1050
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:04,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation for budget discussions to take place in personnel subcommittee.

1051
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:06,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

1052
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:22,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I think while you're walking to the microphone, because the budget of the school department is so heavily focused on personnel, we're going to rename that committee personnel budget for future moving forward.

1053
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:39,762
[SPEAKER_16]: So this proposal that you received is an attempt to truly increase transparency and provide opportunities for greater conversation at the subcommittee level.

1054
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:42,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And you've received samples.

1055
01:32:43,444 --> 01:32:53,889
[SPEAKER_16]: So the attached documents represent a proposed timeline for the personnel budget subcommittee to hold working meetings for development of the 2020 budget.

1056
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:02,735
[SPEAKER_16]: As you can see, a sample of the document format that would be used during the budget development is attached.

1057
01:33:03,516 --> 01:33:07,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And the format is intended to inform of the past year's budget.

1058
01:33:09,462 --> 01:33:20,691
[SPEAKER_16]: fiscal year 18 compared to the current year budget fiscal year 19, as well as expenditures year to date in a proposed column for fiscal year 20.

1059
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:30,939
[SPEAKER_16]: So the proposed figures will be submitted by department heads, building principals and administrators that ultimately get presented to

1060
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:38,225
[SPEAKER_16]: the subcommittee, and eventually the full budget process will be presented to you as a whole group.

1061
01:33:39,085 --> 01:33:48,652
[SPEAKER_16]: So approval of a schedule is recommended in order to plan and notify all involved who are preparing to submit documents.

1062
01:33:54,654 --> 01:34:13,178
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I have no problem going for this to go to subcommittee because I happen to be on the subcommittee if I wasn't I Would want to be at all of these meetings because the budget is one of our main priorities as a school committee member We oversee the budget and we oversee the superintendent so

1063
01:34:15,078 --> 01:34:22,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I really feel like I'd support anybody who's not on this committee feeling necessary to attend these meetings.

1064
01:34:22,446 --> 01:34:26,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a problem with the date of April 4th and possibly some other dates.

1065
01:34:28,472 --> 01:34:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So, other than the exact dates, if that could be changed, I'd like to hear from other committee members and make sure that the scheduled time frame works for them as well.

1066
01:34:42,602 --> 01:34:59,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have a conflict with April 4th and I'm out of town on March 21st and one of the other dates is a school committee meeting night May 6 so if the meeting was 6 to 7 30 we would probably have to move the time up or have it at the at City Hall

1067
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:05,913
[SPEAKER_14]: and have it earlier and finish directly before the school committee meeting, that could work.

1068
01:35:05,993 --> 01:35:08,474
[SPEAKER_14]: We could keep it that night.

1069
01:35:08,654 --> 01:35:17,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure, but I'm happy to go to the meetings, and that's why I wanted to see if we can change the two dates and swap it out with another date.

1070
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:29,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if there's a vote for it to happen this way, then I think that the committee should be working on dates that are reasonable for them.

1071
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:34,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So that everyone can, I know Paula is the chair of that committee.

1072
01:35:34,504 --> 01:35:35,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the chair.

1073
01:35:35,364 --> 01:35:38,925
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, she will be in contact if it is voted on to go this route.

1074
01:35:39,685 --> 01:35:42,486
[SPEAKER_09]: She can certainly meet with the committee members to schedule.

1075
01:35:43,146 --> 01:35:43,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

1076
01:35:43,606 --> 01:35:46,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I thought we were, cause I, it said that we were,

1077
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:52,682
[SPEAKER_14]: approval of the schedules recommended to plan the meetings.

1078
01:35:54,804 --> 01:35:56,065
[SPEAKER_16]: No meetings have been planned.

1079
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:57,326
[SPEAKER_16]: So these aren't the dates?

1080
01:35:57,866 --> 01:36:01,109
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the proposed dates.

1081
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:06,473
[SPEAKER_16]: So once we receive confirmation from the body, then we'll be able to reach out.

1082
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:11,457
[SPEAKER_16]: to directors and principals, but the dates can be shifted.

1083
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:14,319
[SPEAKER_16]: We can work with that, but it was the process.

1084
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Paulette?

1085
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Burke?

1086
01:36:18,743 --> 01:36:29,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the one thing to keep in mind, the question is at some point we may not be able to accommodate every member's particular, as much as we want to.

1087
01:36:30,774 --> 01:36:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1088
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Patterson is available on Mondays and Thursdays.

1089
01:36:34,237 --> 01:36:37,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that, that's the first limitation that we have.

1090
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:50,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the, to me, it's important, it, um, that as many members as can possibly make whatever subcommittee, uh, meeting, make them because, you know, we want our full representation.

1091
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:58,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the advantage of putting it in the subcommittee is that, uh, we won't need a quorum if we can't get it, um, you know, or it's a smaller quorum.

1092
01:36:59,315 --> 01:37:01,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, personally, I believe that it's, um,

1093
01:37:02,337 --> 01:37:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: important for every committee member who can possibly make these committee to please do so.

1094
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:10,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1095
01:37:11,822 --> 01:37:12,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke.

1096
01:37:13,002 --> 01:37:14,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo.

1097
01:37:15,323 --> 01:37:30,331
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is really one I wish Howard was here, our attorney, because I seem to remember that non-subcommittee members attending was perfectly legal.

1098
01:37:31,035 --> 01:37:32,095
[SPEAKER_15]: under open meeting law.

1099
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:39,617
[SPEAKER_15]: But I seem to also remember the Attorney General's advice is that we should sit quietly and not be participants.

1100
01:37:40,237 --> 01:37:46,539
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody in this room believes that any of us who are not on the subcommittee are not going to participate, I got a bridge to sell.

1101
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:49,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, like, it's not going to happen.

1102
01:37:50,059 --> 01:38:00,262
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I think it would be useful to at least get the advice of Howard to say, if we all show up and we all can't keep our mouths closed because that's not going to happen,

1103
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:21,008
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not gonna get to vote on anything or deliberate but I Just want him to be saying this is okay Because I'm not gonna come to the meetings to sit and listen and hope that Paulette asks the right questions That seems really important to me

1104
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:29,288
[SPEAKER_09]: from Mr. Greenspan.

1105
01:38:29,328 --> 01:38:30,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Giro, next.

1106
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:31,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Burke, thank you.

1107
01:38:32,049 --> 01:38:38,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I stand in opposition to this plan for many of the reasons that Member Ruseau mentioned.

1108
01:38:38,931 --> 01:38:46,693
[SPEAKER_17]: First off, I think that it's part of my fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford to review these items in part of our working group.

1109
01:38:47,293 --> 01:38:53,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like this can be done as in committee of the whole and I dislike the idea that

1110
01:38:55,235 --> 01:38:58,077
[SPEAKER_17]: If I attend these meetings, it will be simply informational.

1111
01:38:59,718 --> 01:39:03,261
[SPEAKER_17]: With all due respect to members that are on this committee, I'm sure they do a great job.

1112
01:39:03,781 --> 01:39:10,906
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think I owe it to the citizens of Medford to be able to speak on these matters.

1113
01:39:10,926 --> 01:39:12,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And I dislike the idea.

1114
01:39:12,587 --> 01:39:15,430
[SPEAKER_17]: While I understand that items that come to us,

1115
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:19,593
[SPEAKER_17]: We would have the opportunity, it would come to us as an omnibus agreement.

1116
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:26,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, I think that this is the wrong direction while I understand the attempt and the idea.

1117
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:34,685
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that all of us should be present at these meetings and it's very possible perhaps we could schedule these from 6 to 7.30 before Monday or other times.

1118
01:39:39,832 --> 01:39:40,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1119
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:53,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in and of itself, apart from the fact that I happen to be the head of the committee, I personally need, you need to understand, I'm also happening to have a committee of the whole.

1120
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: The only question becomes the scheduling, and the scheduling is tough.

1121
01:39:59,305 --> 01:40:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you say you can't do Thursdays or, you know, majority of the committee, I mean, are we

1122
01:40:04,728 --> 01:40:06,050
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we handle the scheduling?

1123
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:10,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Already with these dates, people have said, I can't do that one, I can't do that one.

1124
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:16,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So that becomes the difficult part, is just a pure nuts and bolts, how do we schedule?

1125
01:40:16,881 --> 01:40:17,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of meetings.

1126
01:40:18,182 --> 01:40:21,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, while I completely understand your point.

1127
01:40:22,027 --> 01:40:22,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Azzaro.

1128
01:40:25,535 --> 01:40:27,076
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's part of my job.

1129
01:40:27,136 --> 01:40:31,839
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's difficult for me to, it was difficult for me to attend today's committee of the whole, but I made it.

1130
01:40:32,099 --> 01:40:35,081
[SPEAKER_17]: It was, other members couldn't come in at exactly the right time.

1131
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:36,421
[SPEAKER_17]: They were five or six minutes late.

1132
01:40:36,982 --> 01:40:37,722
[SPEAKER_17]: It's understandable.

1133
01:40:37,762 --> 01:40:41,364
[SPEAKER_17]: These are important matters, and I do believe that our entire meeting should deliberate.

1134
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1135
01:40:41,985 --> 01:40:51,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson, could you just elaborate, because I think this idea stemmed from the finance department on the purpose of these meetings, and what would they be taking the place of?

1136
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:52,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

1137
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is actually a much more

1138
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:01,323
[SPEAKER_03]: comprehensive, involved, and cohesive level of developing the budget.

1139
01:41:01,883 --> 01:41:08,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Previous budget preparation did not include a back and forth dialogue.

1140
01:41:08,687 --> 01:41:11,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It was presented by department heads at school committee level.

1141
01:41:12,689 --> 01:41:16,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I collected all of the data, put it into the budget document.

1142
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:20,653
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our allocation from City Hall on what we could do.

1143
01:41:21,193 --> 01:41:25,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And we reviewed and spared back from there to get to the bottom line.

1144
01:41:26,075 --> 01:41:41,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this is a much more comprehensive, transparent process that really does involve the dialogue and have every opportunity for the committee members to weigh in on items so that these are

1145
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the known budget developed based on the objectives and direction that the superintendent has identified with the goals that the committee has then approved and going into the new fiscal year.

1146
01:41:56,463 --> 01:42:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really a mechanism to show where we've been, where we're at now, and where we plan to go.

1147
01:42:04,565 --> 01:42:11,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are all on the same page of those goals, and we know that we are building a budget fiscally responsible to do that.

1148
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:13,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1149
01:42:13,403 --> 01:42:14,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Stone first and then Mr. Russo.

1150
01:42:15,843 --> 01:42:17,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sharing your proposal.

1151
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Member DiBenedetto and Member Ruggiero said it well.

1152
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:23,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have three roles, really.

1153
01:42:23,767 --> 01:42:28,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to set policy, oversee the budget, and to hire and supervise a superintendent.

1154
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this needs to be discussed with all of us.

1155
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:37,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you trying to streamline it with three of the committee members, but we all need to be part of it.

1156
01:42:37,313 --> 01:42:45,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciated last year during the meetings hearing from each department and hearing from the departments, but also hearing while I was at my children's schools

1157
01:42:45,717 --> 01:42:51,819
[SPEAKER_04]: what the teachers and the parents were seeing, and to be able to hear it and put it together in my mind of what the needs are.

1158
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:59,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate the proposal, but I do think we should stick with how we've done it in the past, that all seven of us are part of hearing from the departments.

1159
01:43:01,454 --> 01:43:01,754
[SPEAKER_19]: May I work?

1160
01:43:01,894 --> 01:43:09,041
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess my question was going to be then what is the purpose of the subcommittee?

1161
01:43:09,562 --> 01:43:20,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we have seven subcommittees and in subcommittee the premise would be that the representative members that are there

1162
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:32,466
[SPEAKER_16]: are given the authority to kind of think about the same way we've met with rules, we just met about the media technology, that was not the entire body.

1163
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:38,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of the decisions that are being made will, in the end, impact the entire district.

1164
01:43:40,015 --> 01:44:04,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like some of the conversations, even with the department heads, that this is just to kind of have it be a fairer process or the intention is to be more transparent with the budget personnel subcommittee so that when the actual budget, like our budget meetings are still going to happen, they're not going away, but when the actual budget meetings

1165
01:44:05,102 --> 01:44:19,363
[SPEAKER_16]: take place, that the subcommittee members would be able to speak more, in a more, I would say in greater detail, to some of, like the rationale, because I also am looking at it from

1166
01:44:20,064 --> 01:44:29,554
[SPEAKER_16]: the time perspective, that when you sit down and you have the budget, you can spend six hours, seven hours going through it and we meet in the evening.

1167
01:44:29,614 --> 01:44:37,982
[SPEAKER_16]: So just in terms of how sharp are we going to be, how much are we going to be able to authentically

1168
01:44:39,103 --> 01:44:39,564
[SPEAKER_16]: give that 110%.

1169
01:44:40,164 --> 01:44:53,836
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like in the subcommittee, with a group or if more people want to come, I'm willing to speak to Howard to get legal guidance on what can happen.

1170
01:44:54,316 --> 01:44:58,359
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just feel like by breaking it out this way, having

1171
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:27,646
[SPEAKER_16]: having the department heads and the school leaders say, these are the proposed things that I want to be able to purchase, but to be able to have it in a greater dialogue and a more meaningful conversation so that when we get our official allocation, it doesn't seem like we're pitting one school against another or we're picking favorites, that I feel like it will end up bringing about

1172
01:45:29,586 --> 01:45:36,952
[SPEAKER_16]: greater participation from the entire school community, but also greater transparency about the process.

1173
01:45:37,812 --> 01:45:38,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

1174
01:45:39,053 --> 01:45:49,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I want to be clear, I actually support this, even if I'm not allowed at these meetings, which is kind of crazy because I'm a details person and I have a thousand and one questions.

1175
01:45:49,702 --> 01:45:56,507
[SPEAKER_15]: And last year during our budget process, I had a thousand and one questions, all of which went unanswered because that was not a setting for that.

1176
01:45:58,178 --> 01:46:05,460
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding also is that a finance subcommittee does this in virtually every other school committee in the state of Massachusetts.

1177
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,101
[SPEAKER_15]: We are the weirdos here.

1178
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:23,966
[SPEAKER_15]: We're the ones who think that Mr. Zigny standing up there and reading from a one-page document for 20 minutes in some meeting every year gives us any input on the budget.

1179
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:29,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to know, so we have this many fine arts teachers at the high school.

1180
01:46:30,446 --> 01:46:32,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions I want to ask are hard questions.

1181
01:46:32,548 --> 01:46:33,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, how many should we have?

1182
01:46:33,969 --> 01:46:35,611
[SPEAKER_15]: How many are there at other schools?

1183
01:46:35,651 --> 01:46:36,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get into that detail.

1184
01:46:37,493 --> 01:46:40,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Our regular school committee meetings would go to 3 a.m.

1185
01:46:40,375 --> 01:46:47,082
[SPEAKER_15]: if we got into the detail we need to get into, and I would give up

1186
01:46:47,754 --> 01:47:05,390
[SPEAKER_15]: the option of digging in, since I'm not on the subcommittee, which I'll want to be on next time around, over what I felt last year was the waving of the wand and saying, we knew what the budget was, because we got this monstrous thing printed.

1187
01:47:07,271 --> 01:47:07,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So what?

1188
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:09,413
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the fine arts budget.

1189
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:10,915
[SPEAKER_15]: What should it be?

1190
01:47:12,295 --> 01:47:13,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the questions we're supposed to ask.

1191
01:47:14,716 --> 01:47:28,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can't go line by line through a gigantic document and interrogate the speaker who came with a presentation, a one-page presentation about the budget as to what's next year look like, what did last year look like.

1192
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:31,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, those meetings would go on forever.

1193
01:47:32,284 --> 01:47:34,825
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to get into that level of detail.

1194
01:47:35,346 --> 01:47:38,007
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think the regular school committee meeting is the right place for that.

1195
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:40,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1196
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:43,992
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that there's a number of items I wish to address.

1197
01:47:44,032 --> 01:47:48,677
[SPEAKER_17]: The first was the question, well, what's this personnel subcommittee for?

1198
01:47:48,737 --> 01:47:59,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, in my opinion, a great use for it would be to decide if we want a badminton coach and a conversation about a team or a new team and how that individual personnel should be hired.

1199
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:13,746
[SPEAKER_17]: The underlying premise that seven of us can't sit down together and have a thoughtful conversation about these topics is somewhat, for lack of a better word, almost offensive to me.

1200
01:48:13,866 --> 01:48:14,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we can do it.

1201
01:48:15,548 --> 01:48:17,790
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like seven of us can't get into a room.

1202
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:22,113
[SPEAKER_17]: A quorum of our subcommittee is four people, for God's sakes.

1203
01:48:22,694 --> 01:48:25,916
[SPEAKER_17]: If Kathy can't be there because of a family emergency, we'll survive.

1204
01:48:26,817 --> 01:48:29,118
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this body will continue.

1205
01:48:29,738 --> 01:48:40,861
[SPEAKER_17]: But in terms of questions of collaboration and conversation, I'm excited that our new superintendent wants to create a more transparent process, and I support the motivation.

1206
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:45,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And while I am very frustrated by this proposal, I understand where it comes from.

1207
01:48:46,203 --> 01:49:02,930
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I do not, we can all sit down in a committee of a whole or if we needed something less formalized, we could do something like a dialogue that we had earlier in the year where we can just sort of throw ideas on the board and see what sticks.

1208
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:05,411
[SPEAKER_17]: That is within our purview.

1209
01:49:06,251 --> 01:49:13,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also do believe with respect to member Rousseau that we are not the weirdo in this case.

1210
01:49:13,334 --> 01:49:14,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I think actually using,

1211
01:49:15,996 --> 01:49:24,304
[SPEAKER_17]: a process where the community has an opportunity to see what's going on in front of a camera versus a subcommittee meeting which might not.

1212
01:49:24,944 --> 01:49:29,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that that fosters added senses of transparency for the community.

1213
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:37,156
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, while I'm very frustrated by this proposal and I do believe it's the wrong direction,

1214
01:49:38,057 --> 01:49:50,783
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand the motivation, and I appreciate the idea that you want to create a more collaborative, a more transparent environment, but we have a forum to have collaborative conversations in a transparent environment, and this is it.

1215
01:49:51,103 --> 01:49:52,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you making a motion?

1216
01:49:52,284 --> 01:49:52,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Cathy?

1217
01:49:52,664 --> 01:49:55,246
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Member Van der Kloot and Member Benedetto.

1218
01:49:55,286 --> 01:49:56,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Cathy's going to cheer right now.

1219
01:49:57,487 --> 01:49:57,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1220
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:02,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathy, Paula and I both want to speak.

1221
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll yield to my colleague.

1222
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the idea of this process tremendously.

1223
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that having the back and forth, the spirit of it is excellent.

1224
01:50:24,858 --> 01:50:29,542
[SPEAKER_08]: It can just be executed instead of the subcommittee, but just do it as a committee of the whole.

1225
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:42,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Still do exactly what you're talking about with these dates or similar dates, you know, and just continue forward with this plan, but just increase the amount of members present.

1226
01:50:43,326 --> 01:50:45,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the idea is excellent.

1227
01:50:45,127 --> 01:50:49,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having knowledge about this and having that back and forth is wonderful.

1228
01:50:50,509 --> 01:50:54,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll appreciate having all that knowledge when we go to vote on this.

1229
01:50:55,210 --> 01:51:00,012
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think that, as an elected official, we're elected to do those small things.

1230
01:51:00,272 --> 01:51:04,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I wasn't on this committee, I would be upset by not being on it.

1231
01:51:04,593 --> 01:51:05,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Burke.

1232
01:51:05,114 --> 01:51:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1233
01:51:05,294 --> 01:51:05,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanden Heuvel.

1234
01:51:06,314 --> 01:51:11,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question I have is the first proposed date is March 14th.

1235
01:51:12,576 --> 01:51:28,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering if I could well, I don't think we should even don't even worry about the dates right now I think it's the principle well for me, and I'm the pragmatist For me the question is saying hey the first date is March 14th who can make it do we have a subcommittee?

1236
01:51:28,524 --> 01:51:34,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean do we have a quorum for a committee if I'll go I mean look I mean The chair right now

1237
01:51:36,168 --> 01:51:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so for me, I've got to be pragmatic at this.

1238
01:51:39,429 --> 01:51:48,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that there's been thinking that it might be easier if it were a smaller group.

1239
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, I listen to my colleagues, and I know that if I wasn't on the subcommittee, I'd be arguing the way that they were, and that's a problem for me.

1240
01:52:00,133 --> 01:52:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, part of me sort of says, hey, wait a second.

1241
01:52:02,976 --> 01:52:04,036
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the first meeting.

1242
01:52:04,116 --> 01:52:05,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nicely organized here.

1243
01:52:06,559 --> 01:52:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: The first meeting is proposed for March 14th.

1244
01:52:10,122 --> 01:52:14,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear other concerns about that particular date.

1245
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:17,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we see how it goes as a committee of the whole?

1246
01:52:18,369 --> 01:52:19,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try the committee of the whole.

1247
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: If it seems unwieldy after that date, we'll reconsider.

1248
01:52:22,992 --> 01:52:23,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't, you know.

1249
01:52:26,335 --> 01:52:35,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to support you, but at the same time, I sort of feel like if I was not on the committee, I would be arguing just the way my colleagues who are opposed to it are.

1250
01:52:36,638 --> 01:52:38,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rousseau.

1251
01:52:39,818 --> 01:52:47,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, I'm going to attend every one of these meetings, no matter what the dates are, because I prioritize the school committee above all other commitments.

1252
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:50,161
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will be at any date that you put down.

1253
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:53,502
[SPEAKER_15]: And that would have been the case even if I had to sit silently.

1254
01:52:54,195 --> 01:53:02,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I am fine with the Committee of the Whole if the scheduling is done in a rational way rather than reaching out to all seven of us.

1255
01:53:02,957 --> 01:53:03,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you do this date?

1256
01:53:03,797 --> 01:53:09,918
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for seven people to reply to a doodle poll and four days later nobody's replied or half of you have replied.

1257
01:53:10,918 --> 01:53:17,399
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to start these meetings until next year if we do scheduling like we schedule subcommittee meetings.

1258
01:53:18,339 --> 01:53:21,120
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I would vote for Committee of the Whole if

1259
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:28,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it would be the mayor, since she will say what the schedule is, and we'll make it, or we won't make it.

1260
01:53:28,886 --> 01:53:30,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're not going to argue about the dates.

1261
01:53:31,268 --> 01:53:32,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm fine with that.

1262
01:53:32,509 --> 01:53:35,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I just had a suggestion.

1263
01:53:36,453 --> 01:53:46,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the dates when we have the committee of holes on Monday before the school committee meetings, we're all attending the school committee meeting, and we can usually all make those meetings.

1264
01:53:47,242 --> 01:53:49,264
[SPEAKER_14]: If we had it, it would just probably be from 6 to 7.

1265
01:53:51,068 --> 01:53:58,510
[SPEAKER_09]: But we can't, in order to accomplish things we need to at least start that early or earlier.

1266
01:54:00,551 --> 01:54:12,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't, if I may Mayor Burke, I didn't understand why the first meeting March 14th, which is a week from tomorrow, was you said maybe it won't work.

1267
01:54:12,514 --> 01:54:14,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't it work date-wise?

1268
01:54:15,228 --> 01:54:28,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, we've kind of, our timeline keeps moving, and I'm just thinking about the turnaround for the administration to respond for the input into their respective areas, but we can certainly push on that.

1269
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:41,751
[SPEAKER_02]: If I made a motion that we had a committee of the whole meeting next week to, on March 14th, to discuss the items listed, guidance, English language cards, social studies, that can't happen at this point?

1270
01:54:44,717 --> 01:54:45,497
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're uncertain.

1271
01:54:45,577 --> 01:54:47,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have to review the schedules to see.

1272
01:54:49,518 --> 01:54:52,098
[SPEAKER_09]: March 14th may be good for you, but it may not be good for me.

1273
01:54:52,138 --> 01:54:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the chair, I'd probably want to schedule something that I could attend.

1274
01:54:56,659 --> 01:54:57,779
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to scheduling.

1275
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:00,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And the administrators probably for the.

1276
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:03,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And the administrators to prepare the document, I would imagine.

1277
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to take some time.

1278
01:55:04,361 --> 01:55:09,201
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think right now, we should probably just take a vote whether or not we want a subcommittee or a committee of the whole.

1279
01:55:09,241 --> 01:55:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can just move on and try to schedule things.

1280
01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to create a committee of the whole to have these proposed- There's a motion on the floor that a committee of the whole be held to conduct these pre-budget hearings.

1281
01:55:21,657 --> 01:55:25,139
[SPEAKER_17]: In the evening, if possible, at 6 o'clock, sometime around that.

1282
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:27,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be earlier than 6, though.

1283
01:55:27,241 --> 01:55:28,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It may have to be earlier than 6.

1284
01:55:28,402 --> 01:55:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1285
01:55:28,782 --> 01:55:29,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1286
01:55:29,443 --> 01:55:30,023
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion.

1287
01:55:30,043 --> 01:55:31,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

1288
01:55:31,484 --> 01:55:33,746
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do it in an hour.

1289
01:55:34,026 --> 01:55:35,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1290
01:55:35,407 --> 01:55:36,328

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:55:45,655 --> 01:55:45,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1321
01:56:07,747 --> 01:56:08,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1322
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:09,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

1323
01:56:10,011 --> 01:56:10,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Nicole.

1324
01:56:11,294 --> 01:56:12,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Wasn't she in earlier?

1325
01:56:12,476 --> 01:56:13,839
[SPEAKER_17]: I had her up at the podium.

1326
01:56:13,879 --> 01:56:17,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 12, report new standards for social studies.

1327
01:56:17,625 --> 01:56:18,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Chiesa.

1328
01:56:25,035 --> 01:56:25,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello again.

1329
01:56:25,735 --> 01:56:25,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1330
01:56:27,376 --> 01:56:34,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I am asked here tonight to update you on the new history and social science curriculum.

1331
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:52,268
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have heard bits and pieces about it and it is a significant change for my department that I want to make you aware of the work we've done thus far and the future steps that we will be encountering over the course of this school year and into next school year as well.

1332
01:56:53,275 --> 01:57:07,320
[SPEAKER_01]: The major changes that are impacting this framework and really our curriculum as a department, K-12, is obviously the new framework that DESE released, as well as Chapter 296 of the Acts of 2018.

1333
01:57:10,422 --> 01:57:22,913
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking at just the 2018 Massachusetts History and Social Science Curriculum framework, we see that there are significant changes to that framework compared to the older version.

1334
01:57:24,274 --> 01:57:33,763
[SPEAKER_01]: This was officially adopted in June 26, 2018, and there are several phases that are put in place before full implementation begins.

1335
01:57:34,303 --> 01:57:36,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have actually been working on this

1336
01:57:36,605 --> 01:57:42,611
[SPEAKER_01]: for not just this school year, but the prior school year as well, anticipating these changes.

1337
01:57:43,011 --> 01:57:47,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we did not have the final document until June 26 of this school year of 2018.

1338
01:57:51,843 --> 01:58:04,013
[SPEAKER_01]: The framework is guided with really two key goals, a significant emphasis on civic education and to deepen the understanding of history, civics, geography, and economics.

1339
01:58:04,714 --> 01:58:07,216
[SPEAKER_01]: There are six phases to implementation.

1340
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:11,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one was where they gathered recommendations for the vision and structure.

1341
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:17,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase two was where there was a draft and review of the proposed revisions.

1342
01:58:18,017 --> 01:58:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase three was where DESE presented the draft and allowed for the public to comment, which I will add, and I will mention in a minute, our entire faculty had the opportunity to comment.

1343
01:58:32,184 --> 01:58:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually carved out time in the department meetings at the secondary level so that they could participate in this public survey last school year, which was very important because these changes are

1344
01:58:44,257 --> 01:58:45,378
[SPEAKER_01]: quite an impact on them.

1345
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:55,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase four is where we are, and that is where they disseminated the new framework, and we are identifying support for implementation.

1346
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:05,089
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move along in the phases in this future years, we are going to see a state history and social science assessment and administration.

1347
01:59:06,538 --> 01:59:14,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get into that a little bit more, but I will tell you that grade 8 is the grade that they are targeting to have a state assessment.

1348
01:59:15,704 --> 01:59:20,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, they are piloting that in some extremely small pilot.

1349
01:59:21,148 --> 01:59:24,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like three neighboring districts at a PD that was held.

1350
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still very much in its infancy, but they are looking to do this at grade 8.

1351
01:59:31,395 --> 01:59:32,856
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not know yet.

1352
01:59:33,396 --> 01:59:38,559
[SPEAKER_01]: which grade it will be for the high school, but we do know it will be coming.

1353
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:47,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And that decision is going to impact some of the curriculum decisions that I make with the support of the superintendent and the input of the teachers.

1354
01:59:48,506 --> 01:59:54,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase six is what I just said, actually, that's that history and social science assessment for the competency determination.

1355
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:58,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I provide in the report an overview of Chapter 296 of the Acts of 2018.

1356
02:00:00,347 --> 02:00:03,288
[SPEAKER_01]: because that does affect our department as well.

1357
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:06,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great, it's terrific.

1358
02:00:06,588 --> 02:00:19,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Each public school with a grade eight and every single public high school is now by law going to have to have at least one student-led non-partisan civics project that is consistent with the history and social science framework.

1359
02:00:20,811 --> 02:00:27,132
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be something called a Commonwealth Civics Challenge that is going to be made available to grade eight students.

1360
02:00:27,713 --> 02:00:29,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a department meeting today and we were already

1361
02:00:30,253 --> 02:00:31,914
[SPEAKER_01]: very excited with this.

1362
02:00:32,354 --> 02:00:38,275
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some civics projects trust funds that we'll look into for support with this.

1363
02:00:39,156 --> 02:00:51,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be a significant, we're very good in Medford in terms of having our youths involved in a number of different projects and a number of different

1364
02:00:53,206 --> 02:01:05,259
[SPEAKER_01]: options for them, but the law now is going to offer even more opportunities for the youth to become involved in a variety of municipal boards, committees, and commissions.

1365
02:01:05,319 --> 02:01:07,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see more of that, which is great.

1366
02:01:09,433 --> 02:01:19,558
[SPEAKER_01]: If I switch gears back to the actual framework, so I'm going to move away from the law for a minute and move back to the framework, I have provided for you in the report a list of structural changes.

1367
02:01:19,638 --> 02:01:23,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So the staff is getting used to the way we're seeing the framework.

1368
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:24,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's huge.

1369
02:01:24,781 --> 02:01:27,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go through them all, but we have the addition of guiding principles.

1370
02:01:28,528 --> 02:01:39,053
[SPEAKER_01]: We have standards for reading, writing, speaking, and listening that are drawn from the ELA framework, which is great for us as a humanities department because there's a clear overlap.

1371
02:01:39,889 --> 02:01:42,750
[SPEAKER_01]: but now they are right in there, ready to go.

1372
02:01:43,831 --> 02:01:48,373
[SPEAKER_01]: We have embedded skills in each thematic unit and supporting questions.

1373
02:01:49,174 --> 02:01:58,338
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of content, which I would assume you may be even more interested in, is there is really an expanded history of diverse groups and people.

1374
02:01:58,438 --> 02:02:01,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we look at the different grade levels, we see

1375
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:04,623
[SPEAKER_01]: an expansion from what was in the original framework.

1376
02:02:05,203 --> 02:02:09,968
[SPEAKER_01]: There are new research standards that our students are going to be expected to achieve across the grade levels.

1377
02:02:10,669 --> 02:02:12,991
[SPEAKER_01]: There are those enhanced literacy standards.

1378
02:02:14,047 --> 02:02:17,589
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a significant change in our grade six and seven sequencing.

1379
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:24,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the sixth graders are taking now will change, and similarly with the seventh grade.

1380
02:02:25,355 --> 02:02:34,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And grade eight is really, the most impact is felt at grade eight, because it is moving away from what we currently offer, which is U.S.

1381
02:02:34,021 --> 02:02:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: History I, and it's civics.

1382
02:02:37,323 --> 02:02:40,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So that grade eight is now going to be civics.

1383
02:02:40,825 --> 02:02:42,686
[SPEAKER_01]: which is awesome, great.

1384
02:02:44,068 --> 02:02:49,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the transition, you know, we will, we will walk, we will get through it.

1385
02:02:50,052 --> 02:02:51,954
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are excited by that.

1386
02:02:52,714 --> 02:02:56,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to mention that there is a movement.

1387
02:02:56,938 --> 02:02:59,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So, grade eight currently is offering U.S.

1388
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:08,367
[SPEAKER_01]: History I. Now, the grades nine through 12 will have to offer World I, World II, which is what we offer in grades nine and 10, U.S.

1389
02:03:08,407 --> 02:03:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: History I, which pulls from the grade eight,

1390
02:03:10,612 --> 02:03:10,972
[SPEAKER_01]: and U.S.

1391
02:03:11,012 --> 02:03:11,632
[SPEAKER_01]: history too.

1392
02:03:12,353 --> 02:03:16,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been working very hard to phase out the sequencing for this to occur.

1393
02:03:18,034 --> 02:03:19,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the content changes.

1394
02:03:19,895 --> 02:03:26,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I may, I'd like to walk you through what we have currently done and what we plan to do as we move forward.

1395
02:03:26,777 --> 02:03:37,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So under the direction of myself, we have, and the superintendent and the associate superintendent, we have been working very actively over the past few years to prepare for the changes.

1396
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:38,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew they were coming.

1397
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: staff has looked at them before they were officially adopted, staff has given input, whether it was positive or negative, and now we have the framework.

1398
02:03:47,014 --> 02:03:58,399
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we are offering professional development for all teachers at the elementary level to receive an in-depth overview and analysis of the 2018 Massachusetts History and Social Science Framework.

1399
02:03:58,799 --> 02:04:03,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the end of the school year, every elementary school, led by myself and with the support of some

1400
02:04:03,901 --> 02:04:16,107
[SPEAKER_01]: lead teachers are going to have the opportunity to attend the PD to really understand the changes, which is important because at the elementary level they are dealing with numerous subject areas.

1401
02:04:16,287 --> 02:04:19,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're happy to have that opportunity to really present it.

1402
02:04:21,743 --> 02:04:23,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, work more with it.

1403
02:04:24,304 --> 02:04:36,670
[SPEAKER_01]: At the secondary level, every single one of our department meetings has been devoted at least in some way to really understanding the framework, mapping it out, looking through it, and going on.

1404
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:41,853
[SPEAKER_01]: We have looked at creating essential questions at each grade level to align with our district curriculum.

1405
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:46,463
[SPEAKER_01]: We have engaged in strategic planning for these significant changes that I've mentioned.

1406
02:04:47,164 --> 02:04:52,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a department meeting today where we were once again engaged in looking at this.

1407
02:04:52,688 --> 02:05:01,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And on our professional development day on March 12th, I will be able to work with the social studies teachers to delve even more deeply into this.

1408
02:05:01,455 --> 02:05:08,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, we are going to have the Department of Secondary Education Humanities Framework Revision lead

1409
02:05:09,024 --> 02:05:18,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Michelle Ryan, she's going to teleconference in with us for a portion of that PD day so that we can ask some burning questions, questions that all the districts have.

1410
02:05:18,531 --> 02:05:26,497
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been in close contact with the other districts as we move forward to see where they're going as well, since it's such an impact.

1411
02:05:27,237 --> 02:05:32,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Down the line, you will see a brand new current social studies district curriculum.

1412
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:40,062
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be formulating curriculum committees to make this transition methodical and thoughtful and purposeful.

1413
02:05:41,163 --> 02:05:48,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will be making some decisions on that scope and sequence with the support of the superintendent and our associate superintendent as well.

1414
02:05:49,306 --> 02:06:08,838
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be revising the elementary standards-based report cards, reviewing and applying for any grants that might be available to support these changes, selecting and piloting materials, particularly at that grade 8 level, but also at really the 6th and 7th, and certainly implementing that Commonwealth Civics Challenge, which I'm sure you'll all hear.

1415
02:06:09,277 --> 02:06:11,218
[SPEAKER_01]: more about as we move forward.

1416
02:06:11,238 --> 02:06:20,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been quite busy, and we are very clearly in control of a plan for what is really a huge impact.

1417
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:24,261
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not had a new framework in decades for social studies.

1418
02:06:24,321 --> 02:06:27,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting, but it's new.

1419
02:06:28,082 --> 02:06:33,284
[SPEAKER_01]: So having done the ELA framework and gone through those revisions back in 2011,

1420
02:06:35,084 --> 02:06:40,886
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking that same process of being methodical and thoughtful and collaborative as we move forward.

1421
02:06:41,606 --> 02:06:42,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

1422
02:06:43,447 --> 02:06:46,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1423
02:06:46,408 --> 02:06:46,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

1424
02:06:47,008 --> 02:06:47,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Giro?

1425
02:06:48,128 --> 02:06:55,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm interested in your mentioning about the assessment that's going to be at the graduation.

1426
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:57,831
[SPEAKER_17]: So is this an assessment similar to the MCAS?

1427
02:06:57,871 --> 02:06:59,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that going to be the design paradigm?

1428
02:06:59,572 --> 02:06:59,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1429
02:06:59,672 --> 02:07:01,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an MCAS design.

1430
02:07:04,492 --> 02:07:05,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's in pilot form.

1431
02:07:05,872 --> 02:07:10,794
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not decided what grade at the elementary, if at all, and what grade at the high school.

1432
02:07:11,354 --> 02:07:12,694
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been pretty clear.

1433
02:07:12,714 --> 02:07:17,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will be three actually, elementary, secondary, and high school.

1434
02:07:17,916 --> 02:07:22,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to science, where they do elementary, secondary, and high school, or middle school and high school.

1435
02:07:23,598 --> 02:07:28,562
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do, there's a lot of unanswered questions that DESE can't answer, and I've been in close contact with them.

1436
02:07:28,862 --> 02:07:35,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do know is out of elementary, middle, and high, we know grade eight is going to be one of those MCAS scores.

1437
02:07:36,468 --> 02:07:41,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in my opinion is a little bit unfortunate given that that year they also have science.

1438
02:07:42,022 --> 02:07:45,226
[SPEAKER_01]: English, math, that grade's going to have four.

1439
02:07:45,246 --> 02:07:47,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be curious to see where the state falls.

1440
02:07:47,409 --> 02:07:52,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But where there's such an emphasis on civics, I have a feeling the MCAS will stay for that.

1441
02:07:52,256 --> 02:07:54,799
[SPEAKER_17]: I also assume new educational materials will have to be purchased.

1442
02:07:55,317 --> 02:07:58,238
[SPEAKER_01]: For grade eight, we really are going, yes.

1443
02:07:58,619 --> 02:07:59,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say yes.

1444
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:00,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1445
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:02,000
[SPEAKER_01]: More budget.

1446
02:08:03,201 --> 02:08:06,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Has the state offered any financial support?

1447
02:08:06,242 --> 02:08:13,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet, but as one of the points in this report is looking at grants to support some of those materials.

1448
02:08:13,706 --> 02:08:19,128
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've learned having implemented that immense ELA framework changes, we don't want to be too quick.

1449
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:24,736
[SPEAKER_01]: in selecting materials, because right now I have a lot of people coming at me and saying, this is it, this is it, this is the best thing.

1450
02:08:25,137 --> 02:08:26,899
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going to be, again, methodical.

1451
02:08:26,939 --> 02:08:31,225
[SPEAKER_01]: We have criteria that we look at before we make any decisions.

1452
02:08:31,725 --> 02:08:36,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot coming out, but we won't see.

1453
02:08:36,872 --> 02:08:38,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, during budget, I am anticipating

1454
02:08:39,172 --> 02:08:46,414
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these needs popping up, but certainly we're gonna look for other areas that support through various grants and whatnot.

1455
02:08:46,714 --> 02:08:47,254
[SPEAKER_17]: One last question.

1456
02:08:47,274 --> 02:08:47,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1457
02:08:47,374 --> 02:08:49,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

1458
02:08:50,054 --> 02:08:59,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Have DESE published the core curriculum, the actual topics that will be tested on this exam, like the different modalities?

1459
02:08:59,516 --> 02:09:07,218
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just have told us, and they just told us at the most recent PD that it was grade eight, and it was news to everybody.

1460
02:09:08,018 --> 02:09:10,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have a lot of unanswered questions as well.

1461
02:09:12,519 --> 02:09:14,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll move slowly with them.

1462
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:15,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

1463
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But very carefully.

1464
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:17,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Please keep us up to date.

1465
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:17,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

1466
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:18,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

1467
02:09:18,821 --> 02:09:21,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting, but it's an impact.

1468
02:09:21,501 --> 02:09:24,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I told my staff today, I said, we're not going to be overwhelmed by this.

1469
02:09:24,322 --> 02:09:25,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take this step by step.

1470
02:09:26,042 --> 02:09:29,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at, really, the framework is beautifully written.

1471
02:09:29,623 --> 02:09:33,104
[SPEAKER_01]: That focus on civics is something I think we've all wanted for years.

1472
02:09:33,204 --> 02:09:33,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have.

1473
02:09:35,485 --> 02:09:39,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing, it's just there are certainly changes and we have it under control.

1474
02:09:40,388 --> 02:09:40,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1475
02:09:40,729 --> 02:09:43,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

1476
02:09:43,851 --> 02:09:44,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Mastone?

1477
02:09:45,232 --> 02:09:46,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

1478
02:09:46,693 --> 02:09:47,453
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1479
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:47,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

1480
02:09:48,054 --> 02:09:48,734
[SPEAKER_01]: All those opposed?

1481
02:09:48,834 --> 02:09:49,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion passes.

1482
02:09:49,635 --> 02:09:49,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1483
02:09:49,955 --> 02:09:50,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1484
02:09:50,956 --> 02:09:52,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Mayor Burke.

1485
02:09:53,057 --> 02:09:54,818
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a couple more items.

1486
02:09:54,999 --> 02:09:56,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an undersuspension.

1487
02:09:59,182 --> 02:10:08,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Under new business, under suspension, school committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Texera.

1488
02:10:08,529 --> 02:10:14,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosemary was the mother of Paul Texera, director of English Learners and Title III for the Medford Public Schools.

1489
02:10:15,234 --> 02:10:22,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of firefighter Steven Pena.

1490
02:10:22,459 --> 02:10:26,743
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a 43-year veteran of the Medford Fire Department.

1491
02:10:27,463 --> 02:10:35,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And he passed away last week, and he leaves behind his wife, Sydney Lynn Pena, and two daughters, Jasmine and Chloe, students in the Medford Public Schools.

1492
02:10:35,695 --> 02:10:37,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1493
02:10:47,708 --> 02:10:48,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1494
02:10:49,268 --> 02:10:49,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1495
02:10:49,989 --> 02:10:50,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1496
02:10:51,489 --> 02:10:57,910
[SPEAKER_08]: We received a report on the Manfred High School Student Activity Account.

1497
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:02,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we add this to the next agenda just so I could ask a few questions to it?

1498
02:11:02,371 --> 02:11:02,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly.

1499
02:11:02,992 --> 02:11:03,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1500
02:11:05,352 --> 02:11:08,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And seeing and hearing none, there's no executive session.

1501
02:11:08,853 --> 02:11:13,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Greenspan could not be in attendance, so that will be on the next agenda for our next meeting.

1502
02:11:14,814 --> 02:11:15,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

1503
02:11:16,375 --> 02:11:16,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1504
02:11:16,795 --> 02:11:17,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
