    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=122.646s">This</a>  year, we have three. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=123.126s">And</a>  the first year, we went to the national team.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=180.83s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=330.967s">th</a>  th <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=430.781s">I've</a>  been asking for this all year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=431.481s">Not</a>  even acknowledging it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=432.002s">I</a>  usually do it through the help desk, you know, that I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=433.182s">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=459.757s">th</a>  th <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=600.933s">Okay,</a>  I'm gonna do it anyway though. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=778.07s">but</a>  he wouldn't want to be in a relationship with that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=779.451s">He</a>  would not want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=780.031s">He</a>  would not want to do that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1241.032s">A</a>  regular meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1243.834s">The</a>  secretary will call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1246.012s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1278.885s">Approval</a>  of the minutes of the February 11th 2019 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1283.507s">Motion</a>  to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1287.209s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1288.669s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1289.93s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1291.33s">Approval</a>  of bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1292.211s">Transfer</a>  of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1294.232s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1295.692s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1303.509s">So,</a>  thank you for submitting the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1306.873s">On</a>  page 5 of 11, halfway down, it says a person's name, Smith Lena, and it says foreign language textbooks.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1318.012s">So</a>  that would be a reimbursement for a purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1320.854s">Oh,</a>  OK.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1321.014s">That</a>  makes sense then. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1323.395s">On</a>  page 7 of 11 and the beginning of 8 of 11, there is a repetitive payment to a person for professional services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1334.943s">And</a>  I saw it throughout the billing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1336.904s">Is</a>  that an employee, or is that?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1339.045s">That</a>  is for the adult evening school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1341.487s">So</a>  that's paying for professional services in the evening school program.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1347.775s">Which</a>  evening school program would that be?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1350.175s">The</a>  electrical adult learning.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1352.056s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1357.317s">Is</a>  that similar with, on page 9 of 11, fourth one up, another employee by the last name of Kirby, and the amount is $1,538?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1366.978s">That</a>  is professional services under a grant for the IDEA. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1373.96s">So</a>  these are contractors, they are not employees.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1377.398s">And</a>  then my last question is the last page, second from the last. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1382.9s">It's</a>  just a large amount for McGlynn Middle School miscellaneous items for $5,900.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1390.384s">Again,</a>  these are the student activity accounts that just go through as the warrants, so that is the student activity pass-through.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1399.43s">It</a>  just, it just seems greater than it usually have for that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1403.713s">Thank</a>  you for the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1404.794s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1405.434s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1406.335s">Motion</a>  to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1410.217s">Roll</a>  call vote please.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1412.339s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1413.48s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1416.662s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1417.942s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1419.063s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1419.624s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1421.205s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1421.865s">I'd</a>  like to recognize Mr. Rousseau for suspension of the rules.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1425.027s">Yes,</a>  I'd like to suspend the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1426.548s">Take</a>  a few items out of order.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1428.215s">motion</a>  for suspension is there a second second for the second on the floor by mr. Benedetto all those in favor aye all those opposed suspension is granted to take papers two and three is there additional and nine two three and nine out of order on the motion all those in favor and ten and ten nine and ten okay <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1457.122s">Item</a>  two, recognition of Tristan Howard for accomplishments in track and field. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1461.069s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1461.349s">DeLinch,</a>  are you present? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1464.255s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1464.475s">DeLinch,</a>  step up to the podium.</p>

    <p>[Lynch]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1469.371s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1470.752s">Not</a>  just myself, but this is Coach Donlan, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1473.814s">And</a>  Coach Dempsey is taking care of his mother-in-law in Florida, where we'd all like to be right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1478.998s">So</a>  I didn't want to forget Coach Dempsey, who helped us out this year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1484.302s">We</a>  have a very special young man here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1487.604s">I've</a>  been coaching and involved in track and field in Medford for close to 30 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1492.648s">And</a>  I know it doesn't look it, but as an athlete and a coach, <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1499.027s">It's</a>  been very exciting, but it's also quite unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1501.629s">We</a>  only have a state champion come through every few years, and we're very fortunate to have one just this past season, and Tristan Howard right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1510.516s">Tristan</a>  Howard is here with his very supportive mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1513.519s">His</a>  very supportive mom will watch a two minute or three minutes of racing of Tristan on a weekly basis, but remains at the track meet for over six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1525.124s">Track</a>  meets can be quite difficult if you've never had a son or daughter or a younger person in a track meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1532.69s">They're</a>  long, stretched out days, and I appreciate all the support you give Tristan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1538.554s">I'll</a>  try to make it quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1540.315s">Like</a>  I said, state champions only come through once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1543.558s">I've</a>  probably coached a dozen of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1545.895s">And</a>  this young man is remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1548.697s">And</a>  I want to thank Emily Lazzaro for being patient with our schedule, because once you hear a few things about Tristan, you realize how busy he's been and how difficult it is to get to something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1561.767s">Just</a>  this past, right after the holidays rolling into January, he competed in the East Coast <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1568.251s">invitational</a>  in Providence, Rhode Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1570.873s">He</a>  placed second in the 55-meter dash, and he placed third in the 200-meter dash. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1576.817s">A</a>  week later, he entered the Massachusetts State Coaches Association Lodge School invitational, and he placed second in the dash. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1587.445s">A</a>  week later, he goes to our Northeast Conference meet, and not only did he win the dash, he set a new record, a new conference record in the long jump. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1598.93s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1603.791s">And</a>  the funny thing is, as Coach Joe is reminding me, we only have an outdoor long jump pit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1610.353s">We</a>  do not have an indoor long jump pit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1611.934s">So</a>  it's even more remarkable to be a conference champion and set a record in that event, because you can only practice that event outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1620.276s">OK,</a>  so that was wonderful to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1622.136s">And</a>  at the conclusion of that meet, he was nominated and named unanimously the Northeast <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1628.524s">MVP</a>  runner of the year, which is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1633.905s">A</a>  week later, he becomes division two state champion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1638.947s">He</a>  won the 300 meter dash, which he seems to think is a marathon, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1643.088s">Sprinters</a>  always try to compare 300 meter dashes and 400 meter dashes as if they're running a full marathon, a half marathon, but he's getting better and better at these distances and it's really remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1655.94s">And</a>  then he moved on a week later, he went to the New England, just this past weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1660.583s">I'm</a>  sorry, he went to the all-state meet, which means everybody from the eastern part of Massachusetts to the western part of Massachusetts, all five divisions, he finished fourth place amongst everybody in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1673.787s">He's</a>  not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1674.987s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1675.788s">I'll</a>  be really quick, Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1676.728s">I'm</a>  almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1678.528s">And</a>  now he qualified for the New Englands. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1680.729s">And</a>  he went on to all the New England states. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1683.21s">And</a>  he finished eighth place out of all the New England athletes that qualified for the New Englands. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1688.271s">Congratulations</a>  in the New Englands. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1690.612s">Now</a>  Coach Joe has the honor of taking him to New York City this weekend for the Nationals. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1695.974s">It's</a>  pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1698.414s">And</a>  the best story I can relate it to is when you see a young guy like this or a young lady, and it's been a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1704.365s">I</a>  really do think they make an impression on our community, our high school, our city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1709.569s">And</a>  the example I'll give you for that is my younger daughter who is eight and she's been in track and field since she was four. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1716.115s">She</a>  goes, dad, why are you always at those track meets? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1718.677s">You're</a>  there all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1719.678s">I</a>  go, let me show you the kid that's on the team and how fast he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1724.141s">So</a>  I show her the video clip and then I show her another video clip. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1727.044s">She</a>  looks, she goes, I can beat him. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1730.872s">Her</a>  older sister, who's nine, goes, no you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1733.293s">The</a>  cameraman can't even keep up with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1735.975s">And</a>  that's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1737.275s">But</a>  I hope you all get to know him. <a

href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1741.937s">We</a>  wish you luck this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1743.218s">And</a>  he'll be racing Friday night in New York City.</p>

    <p>[Joe Donlon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1750.093s">As</a>  if that wasn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1752.534s">So</a>  actually, I want to talk about something a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1755.815s">I</a>  am his coach, but I've actually known Tristan a little bit longer than being his coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1760.977s">I</a>  actually had him as a student freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1763.418s">So</a>  I'm here to talk about why Tristan, in my mind, has been and continues to be one of the model student-athletes here at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1771.06s">And</a>  I firmly believe and have believed for a long time that he is an absolute symbol that we have here as what it means to be a Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1778.463s">So,</a>  as proof, and I joked about this, but I think this actually does deserve to be read out loud, this is an email to Mr. Nick Tucci sitting in the back, and this was my nomination for Tristan Howard as a student of the quarter, his freshman year, which he received and won. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1796.186s">It</a>  talks a lot about him as a student, and from what I firmly believe, Tristan has stayed on this path ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1802.227s">So,</a>  hi Nick, this is the email. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1806.448s">I</a>  said, I would like to nominate Tristan Howard as the next student of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1809.97s">Tristan</a>  has been a pleasure to have in my period six world history class, it's an honors class by the way, as well as an impressive leader on our indoor track and field team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1819.909s">Already</a>  throughout the season, he has shown many commendable qualities that a Mustang athlete should possess. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1825.393s">He</a>  leads by example. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1826.754s">He</a>  strives to overcome adversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1829.296s">I</a>  probably added that because we make him run the relay at the end of our meets too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1833.159s">See,</a>  it's not enough that he wins his events, we also put him in other events because we need bodies and he's never said no to me ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1840.825s">He</a>  manages his time between academics and athletics and a busy schedule outside of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1846.731s">He's</a>  a social student and he works outside too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1850.716s">He's</a>  at the Capitol Theater in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1852.518s">So</a>  how he has the time to do these things and has continued to have the time to do these things is really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1858.364s">and</a>  he remains humble all the while doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1860.925s">So</a>  I also added, I know this award is recognized for students who excel in the classroom, but I believe that a student like Tristan can be motivation for other students who may see themselves as an athlete or as a student and not someone who can achieve both. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1878.191s">So</a>  I believe Tristan has achieved both. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1880.812s">is</a>  continuing to achieve both and is something that we should absolutely recognize him as a student athlete of the highest order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1887.686s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1894.6s">Yes,</a>  so Tristan, we have a certificate of appreciation that we'd like to bestow upon you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1900.928s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Tristan Howard for accomplishments in track and field on behalf of the entire school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1908.116s">We</a>  wish you great success and certainly you're doing it the Mustang way, right Mr. Tucci? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1912.401s">Keep</a>  up the great work.</p>

    <p>[Lynch]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1941.746s">and</a>  a great role model for everybody in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1944.168s">Even</a>  my younger children, I can read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1947.832s">It</a>  gets other kids, it gets his teammates working and highly motivated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1950.895s">It's</a>  a lot of fun to be around and we appreciate all your hard work.</p>
