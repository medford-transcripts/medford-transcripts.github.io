Hi there, my name is Aaron Olopone, and I'm running for Medford School Committee because Medford deserves diversity and progress, and because representation matters. Why? Well, because affinity has a huge impact on our sense of belonging, and thus on our learning. When we identify with other humans, when they look like us, and when we share values and experiences, we are more likely to be engaged and enthusiastic.

We are motivated and persistent in our efforts when we connect with our teachers and fellow learners. When we share passions and goals with others, collaboration and innovation is more likely. And when we connect with others around shared experiences, there is an emotional connection that builds up community and a sense of trust and belonging. Like it or not, affinity happens with those who share our experiences, cultures, and contexts.

Everybody, everybody deserves to have curriculum, educators, mentors, coaches, and elected officials who represent them and with whom they can build an affinity. That's why representation matters. So I'm asking for your support.

Help our campaign bring my fresh, progressive voice to the school committee. I am the only candidate with the lived experience of being a recent graduate who understands the challenges of missing out on that representation. Donate, host a meet and greet, sign up to Canvas, and check out our website for more details about who I am, what I stand for, and what my top priorities are in the future. Visit electaronaldpade.com and let's do this together.
