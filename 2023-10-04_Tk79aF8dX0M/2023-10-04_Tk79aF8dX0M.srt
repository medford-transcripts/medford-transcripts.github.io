00:00:01,654 --> 00:00:12,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, my name is Aaron Olopone, and I'm running for Medford School Committee because Medford deserves diversity and progress, and because representation matters.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:12,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:19,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because affinity has a huge impact on our sense of belonging, and thus on our learning.

4
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:29,370
[SPEAKER_00]: When we identify with other humans, when they look like us, and when we share values and experiences, we are more likely to be engaged and enthusiastic.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,693
[SPEAKER_00]: We are motivated and persistent in our efforts when we connect with our teachers and fellow learners.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:41,956
[SPEAKER_00]: When we share passions and goals with others, collaboration and innovation is more likely.

7
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:52,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we connect with others around shared experiences, there is an emotional connection that builds up community and a sense of trust and belonging.

8
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:58,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it or not, affinity happens with those who share our experiences, cultures, and contexts.

9
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:11,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, everybody deserves to have curriculum, educators, mentors, coaches, and elected officials who represent them and with whom they can build an affinity.

10
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,707
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why representation matters.

11
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm asking for your support.

12
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Help our campaign bring my fresh, progressive voice to the school committee.

13
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:30,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the only candidate with the lived experience of being a recent graduate who understands the challenges of missing out on that representation.

14
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:42,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Donate, host a meet and greet, sign up to Canvas, and check out our website for more details about who I am, what I stand for, and what my top priorities are in the future.

15
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:46,378
