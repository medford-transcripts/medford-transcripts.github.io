[SPEAKER_04]: Present, seven present, zero absent.

22
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:36,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start by just saying Member Graham, myself, and Dr. Edward Vincent met again yesterday to review, Monday actually, to review the 208 pages again to come up with two additional alternates or non-voting members, I should say.

23
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I will turn it over to Member Graham.

24
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

25
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:45,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to share my screen, or I'm going to try to.

26
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you all see my screen?

27
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:57,463
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, good.

28
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:03,695
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so let me just try to put it in slideshow mode and see if that makes it a little easier to see.

29
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:21,340
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so just as a quick recap, on the 8th, we voted to seat the nine additional members, the nine additional voting members to the school building committee.

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And we took a vote to add member Rousseau as a non-voting member.

31
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: and to add two additional non-voting members to the committee.

32
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:46,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So this slide is a list of our 15 voting members, which includes all the folks that we appointed back in February and those folks that we appointed on the 8th.

33
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:51,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been in contact with every single one of these folks.

34
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:53,091
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all excited.

35
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:53,932
[SPEAKER_05]: They're ready to go.

36
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:59,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look forward to publishing some bios and information about the committee soon.

37
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are our voting members.

38
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing that we are doing to round out our committee is seating a number of folks as non-voting members of the committee.

39
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: So this helps us make sure we're in compliance with all the rules and the requirements around the formation of the school building committee and that the committee does not, the voting members of the committee do not get so large that holding meetings becomes impossible.

40
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the 8th, we agreed that we were going to add two additional members to the committee.

41
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:43,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So my recommendation and the recommendation of myself, the mayor, and the superintendent is that we add Larry Brown to the committee as a non-voting member.

42
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:48,735
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a recently retired teacher from the vocational school.

43
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I spoke to him, I hear he's being sort of pulled back in to support.

44
00:03:55,897 --> 00:04:00,080
[SPEAKER_05]: his program, so he's, I'll call him pseudo-retired in my language.

45
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:10,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other person that we're recommending is Philip Santos, and he is a civil engineer and a parent of young children.

46
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my two recommendations.

47
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to take any questions.

48
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve Larry Brown.

49
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of motioning.

50
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by member Mso, seconded by member Reinfeld.

51
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,399
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor to approve Larry Brown.

52
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to take a roll call.

53
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

54
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley?

55
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

56
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:37,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

57
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:38,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

58
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa?

59
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

60
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:42,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olopade?

61
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:49,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olopade?

62
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did we just lose?

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

64
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:57,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a yes from you, Member Olopade?

65
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:58,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

66
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:00,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rheinfeld?

67
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:01,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

68
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, Mayor Langelker?

69
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

70
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:08,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion is approved.

71
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion on the floor to recommend

72
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Philips Santos was a civil engineer.

73
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is a piece that we were missing, and also a parent of, I believe, two young children.

74
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:28,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, I had the motion to approve both of them, actually.

75
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you just did number nine.

76
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:30,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

77
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:31,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I heard.

78
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard number nine.

79
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:34,909
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's take one more vote, because that's what I heard, too.

80
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I only heard one name.

81
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, one second.

82
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will make the motion to approve Philips Santos.

83
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by

84
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:46,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olopade.

85
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:46,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I second.

86
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Two seconds we have on the floor.

87
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:52,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

88
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:54,137
[SPEAKER_02]: One moment.

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Bramley?

90
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:07,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

91
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:11,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

92
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:12,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

93
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olopade?

94
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

95
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ntapa, sorry, out of order.

96
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

97
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:22,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rheinfeld.

98
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:23,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

99
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:25,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rossa, yes.

100
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:25,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Longo, correct.

101
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:26,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

102
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:30,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.

104
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will get in touch with these folks, and the committee will meet for the first time on April 30th.

105
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:43,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are getting started on schedule.

106
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:47,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, everyone.

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

108
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:49,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

109
00:06:54,857 --> 00:07:04,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have on the agenda number two fiscal year 25 budget update, potential new revenue sources, budget development and positions.

110
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn it over to our superintendent and Jerry McHugh, our CFO.

111
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Mayor and members of the school committee.

112
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:19,619
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pleased this evening to present our third budget update to you.

113
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:30,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has been really working diligently, but I just want to thank Mr. Jerry McHugh in advance for all that he's been doing to really help us this year.

114
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this evening, he will be talking about potential new revenue sources,

115
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:42,466
[SPEAKER_03]: continued budget development process and positions that we're looking at.

116
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to pass the baton on to Jerry and thank you for this moment.

117
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:57,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry, you're on mute right now.

118
00:07:59,415 --> 00:07:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

119
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:11,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent, and good evening to the school committee.

120
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm attempting to share my screen.

121
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:23,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone see that now?

122
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

123
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:28,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

124
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:30,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight I'm mainly going to focus on some

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,142
[SPEAKER_01]: potential sources of new revenue that we could use to support the budget.

126
00:08:40,303 --> 00:09:00,673
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I wanted to talk about kind of where we're at as we're coming to the end of the budget development process or certainly the preliminary budget and getting ready for public hearing next month.

127
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:18,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We would continue to hone the budget for savings, and I use the term workable savings because we have to kind of make sense out of some of the things we're doing, how the work will get accomplished.

128
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:27,696
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to look at staffing to align to class size and class schedules.

129
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:30,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at

130
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: prior year spending to inform our budget needs in FY25.

131
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:43,966
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to reorganize certain support functions to gain efficiencies in that area.

132
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:54,935
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to ensure that we're eliminating any structural deficits that we're finding in the budget.

133
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:58,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked about this in prior meetings.

134
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:10,835
[SPEAKER_01]: The homeless transportation account is kind of the big one in this category, but those budgets really have to get right-sized.

135
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:20,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one-time spending that those budgets will just be more or less maintained in the future.

136
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:31,530
[SPEAKER_01]: We're managing a transition away from ESSA funding, which many school departments are facing in Massachusetts.

137
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:40,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will ensure that all our contractual obligations, collective bargaining agreements are fully funded.

138
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:49,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be proposing staffing that will allow us to manage

139
00:10:50,761 --> 00:11:15,716
[SPEAKER_01]: some of our cost centers, you'll see a proposal for a transportation coordinator, for example, that we, there are, in my view, there are savings to be made by being more strategic in procuring our transportation and kind of managing it through the end of the, through the fiscal year.

140
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:24,315
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure we're, you know, we have sufficient staff to meet our compliance and reporting our obligations.

141
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And one example of this is, you know, we have a lot of reporting to the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System, and it's very difficult to keep up with

142
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,352
[SPEAKER_01]: their informational needs.

143
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:55,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that we need to do so our teachers can have accurate information on file when it comes time for them to think about retirement.

144
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So that work will just continue right up to the time that we will

145
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:19,829
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a draft budget and be prepared to have a full description of how we're arriving at a balanced budget at the public hearing.

146
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some revenue sources, you know, we've talked about

147
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,832
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing a chargeback system for certain areas.

148
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:48,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have programs that use our facilities that are cleaned by us, that have heat and electricity provided by us for administrative purposes.

149
00:12:49,237 --> 00:13:09,431
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations, you know, our HR department and our payroll department processing time sheets and issuing checks and taking care of benefits that these individuals are provided that work in programs that charge a fee for their service.

150
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:12,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example of this would be our before and after school program.

151
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:18,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So we proposed three areas that would implement chargebacks for.

152
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:27,345
[SPEAKER_01]: food service program, just for utilities that they use, facilities.

153
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:33,751
[SPEAKER_01]: We developed a methodology around classrooms used.

154
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:41,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And for administrative, we're just looking at recouping the costs of our

155
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:49,059
[SPEAKER_01]: business office, HR department, and technology department.

156
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And those would be proportionally allocated to some of these programs.

157
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:03,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And that money would come back in to offset some of the expenses.

158
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:11,217
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the utility expense in our buildings and grounds department when it comes to the food service chargeback.

159
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:23,125
[SPEAKER_01]: The, I would propose to use the facilities chargeback account to help support our building repair account.

160
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:35,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And the administrative chargeback could go to fund some new positions we're gonna propose in FY25 for compliance and reporting.

161
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:41,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will help relieve the general fund budget

162
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,666
[SPEAKER_01]: from some of these expenses.

163
00:14:50,028 --> 00:15:01,517
[SPEAKER_01]: The other area I looked at was are there positions that we could legitimately charge to our revolving funds?

164
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:08,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was particularly targeting two revolving funds that have

165
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:13,996
[SPEAKER_01]: balances that had been underutilized in prior years.

166
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:26,001
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be more kind of a one-time opportunity, because once we draw down those balances, they'd no longer be available.

167
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:28,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd have to kind of bring these

168
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,536
[SPEAKER_01]: positions back into the general fund sometime in the future.

169
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:55,684
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would target salaries of approximately $100,000, one position in our vocational program and one position in the MedFed early education program, again, to provide some additional resources to our FY25 budget.

170
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:12,738
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor is looking for potential funding in her capital accounts for some of our needs.

171
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:26,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's already agreed to fund the recommissioning services for four elementary schools and two middle schools.

172
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:36,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I was proposing in our budget to have a recommissioning program for at least one school and kind of try to do it over time.

173
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:42,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really excellent if we can do all these schools at once.

174
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:47,760
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to provide a wealth of data to do some proper capital planning.

175
00:16:50,407 --> 00:17:04,080
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll be able to kind of reduce our proposal in this area by an amount that would be funded by the city's capital funds.

176
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:12,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mayor has told me she would also look to see if it's possible to fund some of our

177
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Chromebook and Apple device refresh proposal.

178
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:21,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's kind of a, to be determined right now.

179
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,573
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, we do have a lot of devices that were purchased.

180
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:32,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, I believe with opera money over, you know, during COVID.

181
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so we have a significant, you know, over, uh,

182
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:47,272
[SPEAKER_01]: about $2 million worth of devices that have to be replenished over five years.

183
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:51,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So our proposal is to kind of begin to do a refresh.

184
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:56,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have new devices, 20% of our inventories is brand new each year.

185
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:03,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that there could be additional resources from the city to help fund that.

186
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:12,280
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some good news on the Chapter 70 front.

187
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:23,189
[SPEAKER_01]: We were budgeted at the $30 minimum when the governor released her budget.

188
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,975
[SPEAKER_01]: The House right now began deliberations on their version of the budget today.

189
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,077
[SPEAKER_01]: But from news reports,

190
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:47,462
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership of the House of Representatives intends to increase that per pupil amount to $104 per student.

191
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:58,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's many districts in the Commonwealth that are only receiving minimum

192
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:09,473
[SPEAKER_01]: student aid, and so it's just not enough to kind of meet the challenges that school districts have.

193
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,434
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good that the legislature is trying to address that.

194
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:25,997
[SPEAKER_01]: This amount, I believe the Senate at a minimum would agree with this amount, and it's likely that they may also try to increase it beyond $104.

195
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:34,796
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to receive $104 per student in the final budget, that would be an increase in Chapter 70 of $470,000.

196
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:42,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would have to work that out with the city to be able to access that.

197
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:53,183
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a potential extra funding that will come into the city that could be put towards our budget.

198
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:56,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you add

199
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:04,420
[SPEAKER_01]: all this up, you get a little over a million dollars in support.

200
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:24,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And that combined with some increase in appropriation from the city and some savings that we'll be proposing at the public hearing, hopefully that will be sufficient to meet our needs in FY25.

201
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:39,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if anyone would have, we'll make this slide deck available on the school committee shared drive.

202
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:48,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if folks have any questions about these initiatives.

203
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau, then Member Graham.

204
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:03,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

205
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jerry.

206
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:09,463
[SPEAKER_02]: The $30,000 is to study a recommissioning, correct?

207
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to actually do recommissioning.

208
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:12,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

209
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:24,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the recommissioning, what they will do is they'll go back and look at the original system designs of the buildings, how it's supposed to work.

210
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:34,271
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's currently working and then there'll be recommendations that come out of that to, you know, take corrective action.

211
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:39,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Some may be things that, you know, are recommended to be done immediately.

212
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Some recommendations may be kind of more

213
00:21:44,598 --> 00:22:01,477
[SPEAKER_01]: to get on the radar for the next two or three years, but it will give us a lot of data around each school about the types of projects that we have to undertake to kind of bring them up to good operating condition.

214
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it is more of a study, but

215
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,135
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a study with recommendations.

216
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:16,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to an audit, you know, when you take a look at the books and then there's recommendations for improvement.

217
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:17,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

218
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:18,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

219
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:24,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our hearing is on the 6th, correct?

220
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:25,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that when our budget hearing?

221
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

222
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So the budget will be posted on our school website by 5 p.m.

223
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:34,516
[SPEAKER_02]: on May 2nd, Thursday, correct?

224
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

225
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:46,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the requirement is 48 hours prior to the meeting, but I think that would be good practice.

226
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:53,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of includes the weekend, but we could keep it to business days.

227
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:54,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

228
00:22:54,053 --> 00:23:04,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I read the statute, and it's 48 hours, but 48 hours in the superintendent's office, which to me seems like they really did not intend to include weekends because

229
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:11,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to make the superintendent stay open all weekend so that can come and view it.

230
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:15,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I do hope that it's up there by the 2nd, we've in the past.

231
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had years where.

232
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, we just didn't post it at all.

233
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at the meeting, the public had no access to the budget.

234
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure we don't make that mistake again.

235
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah.

236
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:34,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's also a requirement to publish it in the newspaper, and that's a seven-day window.

237
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:51,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So in talking to Thomas, he said, because we don't have a local paper of record, we would probably publish that in the Globe, but we'd certainly get it on the website too.

238
00:23:52,437 --> 00:24:14,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a question out to the MASC distribution list today, because a lot of communities have lost local newspapers, and I'm just asking them what they're doing, because, you know, if you're way out in Western Mass, publishing it in the Boston Globe, I mean, the language of the law is your local

239
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,821
[SPEAKER_02]: or district, I mean, newspapers.

240
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:26,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of hard to imagine anybody thinking you look in the Boston Globe for a Greenfield mass notice.

241
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:42,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I hear anything interesting back on that, I will certainly pass that along, because I do think somebody needs to update that statute, because the assumption that there's a newspaper everywhere is long gone.

242
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:42,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

243
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was written before

244
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:48,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Way before internet and technology.

245
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my final question is, and I think you did say this already, the Chapter 70 funds, those would go to the city and the city would decide whether to send them to the schools.

246
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get them directly, correct?

247
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:01,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

248
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:14,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the fact is that the city does provide more than the minimum contribution because they are paying for 100% of our health insurance

249
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:18,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay for charter school tuition.

250
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're meeting their minimum.

251
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:32,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, the history is that they're usually provided more than the minimum.

252
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:40,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put that caveat in because the city would have some kind of discretion

253
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,439
[SPEAKER_01]: to be willing to appropriate that.

254
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:54,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you look at the spirit of the SOA, we are teaching more English language learners.

255
00:25:56,228 --> 00:26:05,436
[SPEAKER_01]: The SOA is being increased every year to recognize the cost of teaching

256
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:13,247
[SPEAKER_01]: entire school population, but also like special population.

257
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:23,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, hopefully, we can access some of that money.

258
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

259
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:32,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Russo.

260
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Graham.

261
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

262
00:26:38,104 --> 00:26:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Two questions.

263
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:50,267
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is the use of capital funds for things like Chromebooks, that would be like a one-time fix, right?

264
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:54,009
[SPEAKER_05]: That would not be an ongoing way to replenish Chromebooks?

265
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:54,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

266
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:55,089
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

267
00:26:55,149 --> 00:27:05,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we still have to kind of push for building some capacity in the general fund budget for this particular item.

268
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:13,780
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, I'm grateful the mayor is kind of looking at, you know, what our needs are.

269
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:22,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And it so happens that she might have some more flexibility with capital money for this purpose than she does, you know, with the general fund.

270
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:30,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would, you know, but it would be, it would kind of be a one time thing.

271
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:34,524
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to be looking at the same proposal for FY 26.

272
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:37,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if I could too.

273
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:49,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're struggling now, obviously, because of the fiscal cliff, not only ESSER that ran out in September, that's past September, but ARPA that's running out in December.

274
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So you are seeing a big

275
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:52,923
[SPEAKER_04]: fiscal cliff.

276
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:59,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hope would be to have Chromebooks in the general fund budget every year, and that is a goal that I think we need to strive for.

277
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:16,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get through this year without using one-time funds would be a big accomplishment, and it would free up some ARPA funding to hopefully be able to do the recommissioning of, I think, $250,000 or so, plus some Chromebooks.

278
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're doing the same thing on the city side.

279
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:20,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's positions we've shifted

280
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:38,080
[SPEAKER_04]: to CDBG or positions we might be reducing a bit but we're trying to keep our refunded positions in the budget as we are trying to do on the school side so there's just some adjusting we're doing now knowing full well that in fiscal year 26 we're going to have to take that on full time and then

281
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:43,667
[SPEAKER_04]: the contracts we're paying through ARPA through 26 will have to come on the budget after that.

282
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are fully preparing to put more things into the budget over the next several years.

283
00:28:48,750 --> 00:29:01,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this budget is just extremely important to try to get by without any loss and shifting capital, including Chromebooks to one-time funding is just the way to get by this year.

284
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've made progress.

285
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:06,599
[SPEAKER_04]: First year of COVID, we spent 12 million in one-time

286
00:29:07,072 --> 00:29:11,938
[SPEAKER_04]: monies, and then I think I believe it was eight, then four, then last year, the school spent the three.

287
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So this year we're trying to clear out that one-time funding use, and then hopefully we'll be progressing further and doing more best practices as the years go on.

288
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

289
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:40,093
[SPEAKER_05]: The other question I had, the Chapter 70 money, is 470 the net gain, or is that what it would be if it was funded at $100?

290
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it 470 minus 135, or?

291
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:44,696
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it would be 470 over what we are receiving this year.

292
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:44,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

293
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:45,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

294
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:45,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

295
00:29:58,746 --> 00:29:59,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Graham.

296
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:00,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeldt?

297
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:03,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

298
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:09,528
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to the chargebacks and the revolving funds, we haven't seen the rate cards for some of the revolving funds that are coming up.

299
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:15,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be seeing that before the hearing so we know where roughly those rates are?

300
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

301
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:25,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's being worked on, and I think you may see it at the Monday night meeting.

302
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:27,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

303
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:32,386
[SPEAKER_00]: member Graham.

304
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I forgot to put my hand down.

305
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:40,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that was quick.

306
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:42,275
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry.

307
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

308
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:44,977
[SPEAKER_04]: You can continue, Jerry.

309
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:45,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

310
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's actually all I had tonight.

311
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it said positions on the agenda.

312
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:59,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more thinking of the positions we were trying to identify the charge to revolving funds, but

313
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:13,309
[SPEAKER_01]: If folks were interested in any kind of thing particular on that topic, I can respond.

314
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:13,369
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

315
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:21,069
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody else has any questions, it's okay to end early.

316
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We have long meetings on Monday, long meetings on Tuesday.

317
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:31,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no, we appreciate the update and the hard work you and the superintendent and the team are doing over at the schools.

318
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing the same hard work over on the city side, just trying to close the gap and not just close the gap from the city side budgets, but also close the gap so we can hopefully provide more to the schools.

319
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the goal on the city side.

320
00:31:48,502 --> 00:32:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: working throughout April vacation and continuing on this week, trying to balance the budget and make sure that our school committee and city council are happy with what's in it and we provide for our kids and staff.

321
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:04,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

322
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:10,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, I just wanted to confirm that we are working diligently on getting those rate cards

323
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:23,761
[SPEAKER_03]: as up to date as possible to present at Monday's meeting so that we can continue the conversation and hopefully increase some of the rates to help with the budget for next year.

324
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great, thank you.

325
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn?

326
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:32,583
