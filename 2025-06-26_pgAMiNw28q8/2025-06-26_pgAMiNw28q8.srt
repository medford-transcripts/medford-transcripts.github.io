[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Danielle.

30
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:01,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So our first agenda item is 400 Mystic Ave.

31
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a special permit and a site plan review.

32
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:28,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an application from Herb Chambers at 400 Mystic, and it's 400 Mystic LLC for the site plan review to permit the construction of a new three-story structure to replace the existing three-story structure, renovation of the existing five-story structure, along with modifications to the existing parking, vehicular circulation, landscape, and utilities associated with the proposed Herb Chambers-Toyota Boston.

33
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:34,015
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, the proposal requires special permits for the following motor vehicle-related uses.

34
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:45,445
[SPEAKER_07]: That's H3, motor vehicle sales or rental of new vehicles only, accessory storage entirely with an enclosed structure, H4, outdoor motor vehicle sales and storage accessory to H3.

35
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:49,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Commercial two, zoning district.

36
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:55,907
[SPEAKER_07]: This meeting is a, this is an actual continued public hearing from June 5th.

37
00:02:56,947 --> 00:03:00,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask the Medford City staff to do introductory comments.

38
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: before inviting the client to present a proposal.

39
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so as you recall, this was a public hearing that was opened on June 5th.

40
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:28,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The applicant gave a presentation of their initial plans and in response to some staff concerns and concern to the board, they made some revisions to the plans.

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Staff was able to review those and

42
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:44,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We are recommending approval with some conditions, primarily some engineering conditions and traffic, but we'll go into those later.

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can turn it over to the applicant team.

44
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:55,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Who will be presenting for the applicant?

45
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:59,847
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can introduce yourselves and you can begin your proposal or your presentation.

46
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on mute, Frank.

47
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And who's actually presenting?

48
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very sorry.

49
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Chairperson McPherson.

50
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:20,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank Marinelli, I'm Land Use Counsel for the Herb Chambers Companies.

51
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:24,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you all again since the hearing on June 5th.

52
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:33,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Danielle Evans pointed out, we have made and submitted plan revisions, which our engineering team, Gabe Crocker and Dave Newhall,

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,781
[SPEAKER_02]: will go through with the board.

54
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Also here tonight, just for recap, is John Welch, who's the director of construction for the Herb Chambers companies.

55
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:50,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I mentioned, the engineering team from Crocker Design, also our landscape architect,

56
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie Lucier of Ryan Associates.

57
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:58,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time, just briefly, we summarized, as Ms.

58
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:04,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Evans just recited to the board, the site is about 4.86 acres.

59
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the C2 zone.

60
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:14,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do need the special permits that the chair referenced in the legal notice, as well as the site plan review.

61
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:22,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We presented the last time that the existing five story building will be renovated.

62
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Four stories will be motor vehicle sales and showroom, as we've shown on the architectural plans.

63
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:35,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're replacing the current three story

64
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:43,172
[SPEAKER_02]: adjunct building with a brand new building, three stories, over 140,000 square feet.

65
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,734
[SPEAKER_02]: The first floor is about 40 service bays.

66
00:05:47,534 --> 00:06:03,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second and third floors are approximately 106 parking spaces interior on each floor is pretty robust landscaping as Julie went over the last time and the last time on June 5,

67
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: we did have the presentation of the architectural plans and also Gabe and Dave, our engineering team went through the site plan.

68
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:18,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that time, as Danielle has pointed out, there were suggestions to

69
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:27,692
[SPEAKER_02]: make on, and those plan revisions were made, and Dave and Gabe will cover those.

70
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:33,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, it was the handicap accessibility at the crosswalks of Mystic were improved.

71
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:39,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We shifted the curb cuts on Fulbright further away from Fulbright and Mystic intersection.

72
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:47,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We adjusted that intersection so that it forces a slower vehicle speed when approaching the intersection.

73
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We added a sidewalk along Fulbright Street.

74
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We achieved the 5% interior landscaping requirements.

75
00:06:55,292 --> 00:07:02,338
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be discussing with MassDOT the bus stop, which we'd like to enclosure across the street that we're proposing.

76
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have two solar-powered pedestrian signals.

77
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,942
[SPEAKER_02]: We've added pavers.

78
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:14,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It was suggested the last time that we match the design in front of Colonial Volkswagen.

79
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did that, we made that.

80
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,591
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a landscaped area between the sidewalk and Mystic Ave.

81
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,853
[SPEAKER_02]: We raised the concrete crosswalk across Mystic Ave.

82
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:31,775
[SPEAKER_02]: We reduced impervious area and the solar we did achieve.

83
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,337
[SPEAKER_02]: We're proposing a solar on the new addition.

84
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have about 57% solar coverage.

85
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:50,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, with the chair's permission, I'd like to turn it over to Dave Newhall and Gabe Crocker of Crockett Design, and they can further describe these plan revisions.

86
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're happy to answer any questions the board or the public may have.

87
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:56,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And we appreciate

88
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle Evans making herself available on July 2nd.

89
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:10,834
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a work session on June 4th with Todd Blake and Daniel Evans.

90
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:19,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had another work session on July 2nd and Danielle was on vacation out of state, but made herself available.

91
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:26,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that very much and hope that the plans we've submitted meet with the board's approval tonight.

92
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:26,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

93
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Frank, for the record.

94
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:37,450
[SPEAKER_01]: David Newhall with Crocker Design Group, Civil Engineers for the project.

95
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:46,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to take Frank's summary to the next level, give you a little bit more detail of the changes that we did make.

96
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:56,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with the handicap accessibility and overall pedestrian circulation on the site and the changes that we had made.

97
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously,

98
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,737
[SPEAKER_01]: We had shown modifications out front to the sidewalk and the curb cut on Mystic Ave.

99
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,297
[SPEAKER_01]: We've modified those changes.

100
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:21,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Main thing being for the sidewalk that was along Mystic Ave here, we added in the landscape buffer to match what is across the street in front of the Volkswagen dealership.

101
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:33,549
[SPEAKER_01]: The only spot in which it doesn't have the landscaping buffer is where the existing bus stop is that's going to remain as we had to show the concrete sidewalk going around that.

102
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we've added a raised concrete

103
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,272
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalk at the entrance.

104
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:47,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to, or it will be similar to all the existing curb cuts that are along Mystic Ave.

105
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be at grade.

106
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,815
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be a ramp down.

107
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll stay the same slope going across.

108
00:09:54,475 --> 00:10:06,558
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have detectable warning strips at each edge of the sidewalk, just so for anybody crossing the sidewalk, they know they're coming up to an intersection where cars will be

109
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_01]: accessing and leaving the site.

110
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:24,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we added in this crosswalk here so now if there's somebody who is coming to the dealership they drop off their vehicle to be serviced and they're going to leave it for the day and use public transportation.

111
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:33,325
[SPEAKER_01]: They can now exit the service area and come across using this crosswalk then we have a concrete sidewalk that will then

112
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:52,680
[SPEAKER_01]: bring you over to either this bus stop here or you can use the other crosswalk which we've added here at the Fulbright Street and Mystic Ave intersection and then come across Mystic Ave to access this second bus stop that's being proposed.

113
00:10:54,241 --> 00:11:00,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we've added in a crosswalk to the rear of the property so we had a concrete

114
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:06,541
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalk that wrapped around the entirety of the proposed addition on the last rendition.

115
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:28,679
[SPEAKER_01]: This one now takes it so if we have any service members who work at the dealership, their main area and locker rooms are back here, they can, they have now two options to walk to the bus stop, they can either come around the building along this crosswalk, which kind of leads them to not having the best ability here as this is more of an operational

116
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:37,644
[SPEAKER_01]: area or they can use this crosswalk here, come down our concrete sidewalk and then we have the added Fulbright Street crosswalk.

117
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:47,028
[SPEAKER_01]: We then have detectable warning strips and another crosswalk across this Fulbright Street curb cut that will bring you to the two bus stops that we had mentioned.

118
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:53,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we had the two curb cuts along Fulbright Street.

119
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,315
[SPEAKER_01]: We originally were opposing to keep those where they were.

120
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:04,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd Blake had some very good comments about seeing what we could do to push those further away from Mystic Ave and from that intersection.

121
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:12,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So we moved them as far as we could up the screen here and further away from this intersection.

122
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:19,185
[SPEAKER_01]: We also widened these curb cuts from where they are existing for better access onto the site.

123
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:26,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have car carriers access the site, they can come in, enter here, offload on site, and then be able to leave and exit.

124
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:34,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we aligned this curb cut as best we could with this back drive aisle, which mimics how

125
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:39,025
[SPEAKER_01]: the current site operates where the curb cut is more here and the drive aisle is here.

126
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:42,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a lot like how it is today.

127
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also wider.

128
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:48,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proposing there was a utility pole here.

129
00:12:48,270 --> 00:13:00,537
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just proposing to have two new utility poles that span across it to relocate that and be able to still have our power to our site come along here and route how it does today.

130
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:23,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, in terms of making this intersection safer by having this curb cut further away, we're proposing to have this be more of a T. So previously, this intersection, you could come around this corner fairly quickly just because of how it was just a smooth curb.

131
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:27,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's more of a 90 degree turn, so you have to slow down.

132
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:29,564
[SPEAKER_01]: to come and access this curb cut.

133
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:41,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So increasing the safety of pedestrians that might be using this crosswalk or vehicles leaving from this curb cut vehicle travel will be a lot slower than the existing condition is.

134
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:49,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, on the Fulbright Street, we have the added sidewalk.

135
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,400
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did that, we didn't put it in

136
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: leave the edge of pavement where it is.

137
00:13:55,153 --> 00:14:03,397
[SPEAKER_01]: We pushed it into the edge of pavement so that we could keep our landscape buffer along our parking here and on the back side of the sidewalk.

138
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:20,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we just continued this street edge down so then we gain some green space along the backhand side of this second curb cut, so reducing impervious within our site to add more green space as well than what we had previously proposed.

139
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:23,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally,

140
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,977
[SPEAKER_01]: for our landscaping.

141
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:30,765
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things we heard was about this area over here and the sea of parking.

142
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:36,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've added in two landscape islands here we had a break just

143
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:43,325
[SPEAKER_01]: our stormwater design to make sure we have water going where it needs to go as we're treating it and that's properly functioning.

144
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:48,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why there's two and there's a two foot break to allow stormwater to travel through one of our catch basins.

145
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:52,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we added a proposed paver walkway.

146
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding in to have better access for anybody looking to view the vehicles or in

147
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:04,870
[SPEAKER_01]: In case there is an emergency for fire safety, they have the landscape island plus the walkway.

148
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's double of what just the landscape area would be and help breaking up this area as well.

149
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:18,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we've added in landscape islands along the front parking area that is along the Mystic Ave area.

150
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:25,080
[SPEAKER_01]: These changes help allow us to now meet that 5% requirement for interior landscaping.

151
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:34,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have the amount of trees being proposed for the site per the landscaping requirement.

152
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:49,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, on our access around the site, the pedestrian crossing here, we added in two signals, they'll be solar powered signals so we don't have to do any trenching within Mystic Ave.

153
00:15:50,315 --> 00:16:00,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if somebody is coming to cross this parking lot, they'll just hit the button, it'll flash saying, hey, people are trying to cross and likewise on this side as well.

154
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:07,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we also added in pavers and another location on the site.

155
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So we added this paver walkway.

156
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:19,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We also added some pavers for parking across from where you have the showroom entrance, and then also from the main dealership entrance here.

157
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So, getting less pavement and adding in more pavers as well.

158
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:24,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And then,

159
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:38,183
[SPEAKER_01]: As Frank had mentioned, we provided the solar exhibit showing the proposed solar for the addition and for the total site to meet that solar requirement.

160
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:54,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we did explore that option B that was discussed of when we have to go, we have a number of items that are within Mystic Ave, within the right of way that need to have mass DOT approval.

161
00:16:55,051 --> 00:17:05,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did explore and did provide the exhibit for the option B, which would be a right in, right out for this parking here.

162
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for this to load.

163
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:11,188
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.

164
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:19,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here shows that option B that we were discussing.

165
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,860
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure we considered.

166
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,364
[SPEAKER_01]: So we heard the feedback that one of the applications had to come back because they were forced to have write-in, write-out.

167
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:44,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went back with our traffic engineers and this would be the option B for write-in, write-out if we're unable to have full access like we're proposing in the site plan set as it is now.

168
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:48,296
[SPEAKER_01]: We would keep this raised concrete sidewalk going across

169
00:17:49,527 --> 00:18:01,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would also add in a landscape island in the middle to enforce that nobody could be coming down Mystic Ave and try to make this left-hand turn or come out of the entrance and try to make this left.

170
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It forces the traffic to be right out and then to be right in.

171
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would cover the changes we've made.

172
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:14,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we'd like to turn it over to questions.

173
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

174
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:30,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a clarifying question on your plan B, if there was any feedback from Todd, the actual traffic engineer from the city.

175
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:33,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, do you have that information, if there was feedback on that?

176
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:42,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were in the meeting when this was shown to us, and I believe that Director Blake

177
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:52,339
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't have any concerns with this scenario plan B in the event that it's needed.

178
00:18:52,359 --> 00:19:03,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We could put in some language in the conditions that it could be tweaked slightly.

179
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:14,165
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's the scenario that's to be taken, and if it has to be moved slightly, that it would not require

180
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,868
[SPEAKER_06]: a trip back to the board, but I defer to you all.

181
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:20,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the language can just cover that.

182
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:32,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to be in coordination with director Blake and MassDOT to make sure that it was at the city and MassDOT's standards or something to that?

183
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:39,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think some language to that effect that covers in case there's something

184
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:44,960
[SPEAKER_06]: that would need to be slightly modified.

185
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:57,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't believe that Todd had any misgivings about this alternative access in the event that MassDOT requires it.

186
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:05,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make it as simple as possible, but at the same time, clarify it so that it can actually move forward easily.

187
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:05,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

188
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:16,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any clarifying questions from the board before I open it up to the public?

189
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Kelce?

190
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a question, but I think for

191
00:20:36,136 --> 00:21:02,721
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory reasons i need to attest that i did uh watch the hearing of the recording of the hearing of june 5th so as to be up to date on this project and be able to vote on it i just want to get that on the record before we move forward and forget about it thank you very much all right i'm going to go ahead and open it up for public comment um those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message danielle in the comments

192
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:07,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You can send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov.

193
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:18,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record and remind all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

194
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:24,804
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

195
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:30,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can you manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

196
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't look like we have any members on.

197
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:47,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam chair, I don't see any raised hands and I have not received any written comments from the public.

198
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:49,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

199
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:53,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we can officially close the public comment period for this meeting.

200
00:21:55,932 --> 00:22:03,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that brings us back to the draft recommendation and conditions so better understand what we are moving forward with.

201
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:19,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if there's any questions or comments from the board at this time, before I move to motion or approve, are you understanding what we are working with now?

202
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:41,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And Danielle, for clarifications on the conditions in the offsite, I am not sure what offsite conditions, Director Blake, that have not been addressed to include with the draft conditions.

203
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll defer to Peter.

204
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:57,632
[SPEAKER_06]: If we think that it was everything captured on the plans, because usually we would put things in writing if it doesn't appear on the plans.

205
00:22:57,872 --> 00:23:09,695
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I was looking at that, well, while the while the applicant was presenting, I was looking at the provided layout plans just to check it against Todd's comments from the

206
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:38,913
[SPEAKER_03]: uh last go around and it seems that everything off-site is captured i think we will have to put something uh daniel as you said something in the manner of like if in just authorization discussions with mastod that something comes up that has to be changed that that can be run through todd and through pds without having to come back to the board assuming it's not a major change but other than that uh

207
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:53,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, it looks like everything Todd mentioned in his... Everything Todd mentioned in his comments were, in fact, captured in the plans, both on-site and off-site.

208
00:23:56,213 --> 00:24:04,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have to include some language for the off-site ones just because of the MassDOT approval that's needed in case MassDOT needs any changes.

209
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like, at least in my view, that, I mean,

210
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:21,156
[SPEAKER_03]: The RFB, the pavement markings, sidewalk on Fulbright, the curb radius on the corner at Fulbright, the bus shelter, and the accessibility are all in there.

211
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So that covers the offsite stuff.

212
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:34,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for the draft recommendations from previously, these have been rectified for the most part as well.

213
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We had eight drafts.

214
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to make sure that we're on the same page with the proponent.

215
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:41,548
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the drafts?

216
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:44,009
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the remaining conditions?

217
00:24:46,189 --> 00:25:03,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Madam Chair, regarding the engineering comments, Director Hunt was able to connect with City Engineer today about whether one of the conditions or comments was addressed.

218
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:07,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this would be a question for the

219
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: engineering team here.

220
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:24,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's regarding the waterline service to the proposed hydrant located in the parking lot just south of the building, that the pipe should be reduced directly after the T and valve to limit the amount of stagnant water within the pipe.

221
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:28,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he also said the second gate is not necessary.

222
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that addressed or looked at?

223
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:38,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we did look at that and we've made the change in our plans.

224
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:41,874
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't resubmitted our utility plan yet.

225
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:46,975
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some other some minor comments on just the stormwater aspect of it.

226
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:51,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just working through just comprehensively addressing his comments.

227
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:52,976
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't received full comments.

228
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:58,217
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to make sure we got all the comments before we resubmitted but we have no issues with that.

229
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:00,438
[SPEAKER_01]: The comments regarding the water.

230
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:06,823
[SPEAKER_01]: and the hydrant line and the valves and addressing those as he had suggested.

231
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:12,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then I would, through the chair, I would suggest that we, that condition remain.

232
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, prior or the applicant, you know, shall submit an updated utility plan that addresses the city engineers' comments and concerns per

233
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: the email correspondence with myself.

234
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:41,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So beginning from condition one, that was highlighted with control plans.

235
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:45,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Plan modifications have been resubmitted but have control plans.

236
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So the revised plans that were submitted the other week,

237
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the plans should be updated, and I'll correlate.

238
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:24,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that we could, it sounds like one of the plans that needs to be submitted that hasn't been submitted yet is an updated utility plan.

239
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:29,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess this is a question for the applicant.

240
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:39,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the plans that were submitted, how many are outstanding that need to be updated so that we are referencing the correct plans?

241
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

242
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:59,246
[SPEAKER_01]: For our civil plans, we'll have a C5 and C6 are our grading and drainage and utility plans.

243
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's those two sheets.

244
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:09,720
[SPEAKER_01]: that will have some minor modifications just to address the comments received from Owen and the city engineering staff on our stormwater submission.

245
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:20,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think the control documents should be ones that we've received already.

246
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:27,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as modified by

247
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: the written conditions which would be incorporating the new utility plans when they come in.

248
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we'll be covered there.

249
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:58,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm just going to go through just to, so we're not, and then we came to number three on your end, requotation.

250
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,660
[SPEAKER_07]: of the builder permit?

251
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:14,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, so that's one of our standard conditions that the entire decision be recorded, the registry of deeds, evidence provided before they're able to pull a building permit.

252
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:26,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll have the traffic and transportation conditions regarding any of the off-site work, basically describing the

253
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Coordination with MassDOT and, you know, final approvals from Director Blake.

254
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:42,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we try to keep the approvals with the position, so the Director of Transportation or Traffic and Transportation.

255
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:48,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And then language regarding the Scenario 2.

256
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:54,319
[SPEAKER_06]: City engineers' conditions regarding the water line service.

257
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:04,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that is all of any special conditions that we would need.

258
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else would be required.

259
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:15,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we do call out that linkage, that this project is subject to linkage.

260
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:32,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Kirk house, are you taking down the new conditions or you, um, as we go along, I'm just curious.

261
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:49,228
[SPEAKER_03]: As we've been discussing, I've been, uh, writing out based on the, uh, draft conditions that, uh, city staff wrote up and things we're discussing to kind of have a running list of the, of the conditions we will actually need.

262
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:50,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

263
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:50,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

264
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:58,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And have we wordsmithed for that scenario?

265
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to decide on language regarding the MassDOT access permit for scenario two?

266
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:19,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I believe we can do some wordsmithing after the fact, as long as the gist of the condition is conveyed and agreed upon by the board.

267
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:22,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can work with the applicant's attorney

268
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:36,473
[SPEAKER_06]: sharpen up the language and make sure everything is correct and be interpreted by somebody who wasn't at the meeting.

269
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:49,264
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be one of my questions, probably my only remaining question about the traffic and transportation conditions.

270
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:51,105
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point,

271
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:11,934
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can do wordsmithing after the fact, as long as the general point gets across, what is the condition surrounding the, what's it called, the, yeah, the alternative, the scenario two?

272
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a separate condition for that right now, other than saying that should modifications be required due to mass-out approval that that,

273
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:35,341
[SPEAKER_03]: that further city approval of those changes would be delegated to the Director of Traffic and Transportation?

274
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:44,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Because would that not cover the offsite modifications as well as the scenario to modification to the driveway?

275
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:50,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'd be good to call it out as a separate condition regarding

276
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:56,152
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, in the event that the access permit isn't approved.

277
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

278
00:32:58,212 --> 00:32:59,673
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, an unrestricted approval.

279
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

280
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:01,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

281
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:02,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll write something up for that.

282
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so going over the conditions,

283
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:27,163
[SPEAKER_07]: want to take a shot at the conditions before right before I recommend the motion for special event and the site plan review.

284
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:47,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to take a shot to make sure that the board is okay with the conditions either the city or Peter

285
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:01,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one second to finish this sentence on our last thought.

286
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so this is what I have for draft conditions.

287
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:23,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Appliant shall comply with standard city conditions regarding control plans, modification approvals, and recordation.

288
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:31,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Applicant shall submit an updated utility plan that complies with engineering department comments as noted.

289
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: If MassDOT approval is denied for off-site improvements on Mystic Avenue, approval shall be delegated to the Director of Traffic and Transportation.

290
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And if MassDOT access permit is denied and

291
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:59,699
[SPEAKER_03]: The main driveway access is required to change to the scenario 2 access.

292
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: As noted, approval shall be delegated to the Director of Traffic and Transportation.

293
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:05,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I have.

294
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we want to keep the waterline here for now, Danielle, as well?

295
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:15,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

296
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:18,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

297
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an additional or is that covered under complies with engineering department comments as noted?

298
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,042
[SPEAKER_07]: With updated utilities, I think that covers- Yeah, that's the updated utility plan, right?

299
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:38,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

300
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

301
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:41,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

302
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:51,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will ask for a motion to approve first the special permit for 400 Mystic Ave.

303
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:59,613
[SPEAKER_07]: make the motion along with the conditions as read by clerk house.

304
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:03,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need to say that whole thing?

305
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:08,274
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to read that.

306
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need a motion and a second.

307
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll second.

308

[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney Baronelli, the design engineering teams, Mr. Hemingway, we appreciate you being here.

339
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:51,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Madam Chair, and on behalf of the Herb Chambers companies, we want to thank you, the board, and also the Planning and Sustainability Department, the Director Hunt and Daniel Evans and Dennis McDougal, who we work with on the zoning board approval.

340
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:54,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a pleasure to work with the city over the past

341
00:37:54,945 --> 00:38:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: here, and I know that Mr. Chambers looks forward to this investment in the city of Medford and to the redevelopment of the site.

342
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:04,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

343
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:05,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

344
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:06,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great evening.

345
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:07,594
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

346
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:08,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

347
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great night.

348
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:10,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:11,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

350
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:24,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So our next item is minutes, but we don't have any for approval as of right now.

351
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,814
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Madam Chair, they're not ready yet.

352
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the next meeting.

353
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

354
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:43,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So then unless there's anything else that anyone wants, for one, I believe this is Pam's last board meeting with us.

355
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to thank her for all of her help.

356
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:50,424
[SPEAKER_07]: and efforts.

357
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:52,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

358
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having me.

359
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:58,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for staying along with us as long as possible.

360
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish you well, personally.

361
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:01,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

362
00:39:01,394 --> 00:39:02,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

363
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

364
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:05,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Great working with you, Pam.

365
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

366
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:06,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

367
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

368
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:12,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will, with that, yes.

369
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Pam, but I also just wanted to give you all an update on another project, just as an FYI.

370
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:20,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

371
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:28,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The raising canes, which went through site plan review with this board, it's getting pretty close to being finished.

372
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:33,973
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pavements and markings that are not done yet.

373
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:35,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still waiting for a line from

374
00:39:37,615 --> 00:40:00,362
[SPEAKER_05]: uh national grid to come in but I did a preliminary walk through before signing the occupancy you know going through with the checklist from the conditions from this board and so I would just invite any of you if you want to take a look over there informally if you care to you know if you think I didn't see anything other than obviously not all the paving and markings are in yet um but I just

375
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:09,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I really dislike going to a company that thinks that they're 100% and finding things.

376
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been encouraging the department heads to take a look now and just see as they're hitting the last bits.

377
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:37,513
[SPEAKER_05]: there anything that we dislike or think isn't correct and I just thought I would share that with you all if you care to take a look if you do ever see anything in that site or any other site where you say that's not how I remember it like how I remember we approved it you are always welcome to reach out to us directly and say that.

378
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is much preferred that you do it before they actually open, because we still have authority before we give them the occupancy permit.

379
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks good.

380
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to take a closer look for the bike racks.

381
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But I go to that stop and shop all the time.

382
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been watching it go up.

383
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:53,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

384
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:54,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I go to that stop and shop.

385
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:55,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I go over there a lot.

386
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And my only question is, I mean, this has nothing.

387
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:00,445
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't take away from it at all.

388
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:01,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have fans.

389
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what's with all the fans in their driveway?

390
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:05,468
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

391
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:13,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, tell them, Gabe, because you went with me and you're familiar with their operations from other locations.

392
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

393
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:21,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's for like when it's the drive through a lot of the staff, they'll go there if it gets busy and just to keep them cool.

394
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:23,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

395
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:26,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that Apple stand out there with iPads.

396
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that when we were talking about when we were approving them, they were talking about their like congestion management.

397
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:37,290
[SPEAKER_03]: If the drive through gets really busy is they'll just send people out with iPads.

398
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty amazing.

399
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh, my husband is going to get a kick out of that.

400
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:45,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to know, what did you approve those fans for?

401
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't approve fans.

402
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:48,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that means.

403
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:57,406
[SPEAKER_03]: What is fun is obviously the national grid line isn't in, so they don't have electricity yet, but you do sometimes watch them just from convection, just kind of spinning on their own.

404
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have like temporary construction electricity, but not their, not their official reel.

405
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:10,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's certain things they can't do until their final connection is connected.

406
00:42:10,565 --> 00:42:11,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.

407
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I'm pretty sure these are just blowing in the wind slash circulating air because they're all going to different, they're all going different directions at different speeds.

408
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:20,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

409
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:24,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely thought that like sort of like a wind chime, chime, whatever.

410
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:24,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

411
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:36,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I was looking correctly, and I'm usually just there going back and forth to stop and shop, it looks like, in a very smart move for New England, it looks like they've got fans, and in between the fans are heat lamps.

412
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:41,151
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another whole year, right?

413
00:42:41,211 --> 00:43:04,490
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another very small project that I don't remember honestly, if this board provided guidance to the city council, because the energy and environment committee talked about it extensively is at stop and shop, putting in some electric chargers that are, will have video screens on them as like advertising to pedestrians.

414
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll be very close to the stop and shop.

415
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:15,874
[SPEAKER_05]: to the front entrance and that was actually approved by the city council a year ago or more than a year ago.

416
00:43:16,014 --> 00:43:20,135
[SPEAKER_05]: They've just come back around saying they want to install them now.

417
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:25,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly thought that project had gone away, but you'll also see that coming.

418
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:32,038
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be two vehicle charging stations for free at stop and shop.

419
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:35,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Add supported EV charging.

420
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:38,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Opportunity cost.

421
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:42,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's better than the gas pumps.

422
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:43,940
[SPEAKER_03]: They have ads on them, and you still have to pay for the gas.

423
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, the ads are already on the gas pumps, aren't they?

424
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:50,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about Stop and Shop, I can't remember, but I know they're everywhere else.

425
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:53,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're there.

426
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,887
[SPEAKER_08]: For future meetings, it'd be cool to hear updates on projects we've talked about.

427
00:43:56,907 --> 00:43:59,869
[SPEAKER_08]: This was really cool to hear, Alicia.

428
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:00,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for sharing this.

429
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:06,673
[SPEAKER_08]: But whether it's H-Mart, Bank of America, I'm trying to think of other projects that we've come through.

430
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:09,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, there's a ton on the agenda.

431
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you that those two are ones that I get asked a bunch about, and we haven't actually heard from those.

432
00:44:20,418 --> 00:44:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Bank of America is under construction, but they're not close enough to occupancy to be talking to us yet.

433
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think, last time I was over by Wegmans, I don't think they're above the fence line yet that I could see.

434
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:33,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I know the H Mart's not open.

435
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I drive up by it probably more than you all do.

436
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:42,535
[SPEAKER_07]: My dentist is right next door and I keep, that's the only thing I know and I go over there and I don't see it.

437
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,157
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still alive, they're still

438
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: moving forward.

439
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:48,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're busy.

440
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: They're popping up all over.

441
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:54,020
[SPEAKER_06]: They opened the Davis Square one already, but that was it.

442
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,562
[SPEAKER_03]: They're popping up all over the place because they took over the old Be Fresh in Davis Square.

443
00:44:58,102 --> 00:44:58,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

444
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:04,304
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was easier for them to move into that space since it already fit out as a food market.

445
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:05,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a gym.

446
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:11,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's taking more time, but the project is still very much alive and it's going forward.

447
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

448
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:22,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Our interns will be glad to hear that they were asking about HMART and that there's a rumor that it was not happening.

449
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But glad to hear that that's not true.

450
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:37,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're actually, they're telling us that tough students will be over the moon about the Raising Canes, that they're taking the T all the way into the city and back out to go to the one by BU.

451
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

452
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

453
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize college kids really love chicken, all kinds of chicken.

454
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,373
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one that we're working with is the Great American Beer Hall.

455
00:45:53,373 --> 00:46:03,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've actually compiled a list from all the departments of things that they were needed and sent that to them, which they found to be very helpful.

456
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:08,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are shooting for a mid-August opening.

457
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:16,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It is unclear from their construction schedule, their status, if that's actually going to hit that timeline.

458
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: That's optimistic, given what I last saw of their building.

459
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:24,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that they had a sign up in the rear today.

460
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:26,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

461
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:39,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you didn't see it on social media, they announced a chef, that the chef from Snappy Patties is going to be, is going to run a, basically a restaurant, food services at Great American Beer Hall.

462
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:41,314
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

463
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:50,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there had been a question when they came in front of us as to exactly how they were going to do food services and now the in-house show.

464
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:53,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember them saying they were going to do it, but they weren't sure exactly who and how.

465
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:55,198
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

466
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Very entrepreneurial.

467
00:46:59,573 --> 00:46:59,713
Yes.

468
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:13,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And Wackling Fort has applied for their first demolition permit to start taking down buildings so they can, and I wasn't 100% clear that they were, how close they were to actually doing demo, but they've applied for the permit.

469
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are moving along.

470
00:47:16,205 --> 00:47:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

471
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to hear that.

472
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:18,126
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I can't vote on.

473
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:21,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:24,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It started, it started just because Niche worked on it.

475
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:27,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I actually ended up writing a lot of that too.

476
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact,

477
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:33,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd had to let me into some cabinets.

478
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:36,894
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't come out of them.

479
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take anything out of them.

480
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:41,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very important.

481
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:44,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you want the intersection of Boston Ave and North Street to not work.

482
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:59,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's ever you want to like, if you want to email me in advance that you want updates for particular projects, we can also reach out where things stand.

483
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So a quiet night.

484
00:48:03,642 --> 00:48:04,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but thank you all.

485
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:09,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiet when it's a thunderstorm that's starting over here.

486
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:11,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really starting?

487
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on my bike tonight.

488
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:14,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you should probably go home.

489
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:16,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

490
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:17,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

491
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:21,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like I could at any moment, but I don't have anywhere.

492
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to be imminently.

493
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:30,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I finish that thought, Jackie, and answer your motion to adjourn?

494
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

495
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion.

496
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

497
00:48:35,943 --> 00:48:37,784
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Vice Chair Emily Hartman?

498
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:38,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

499
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:40,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Kiles?

500
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

501
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:42,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman.

502
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

503
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Pam Ariansky.

504
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:45,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

505
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:46,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki.

506
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:47,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

507
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:49,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

508
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an aye.

509
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:51,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

510
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

511
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:54,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

512
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:56,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get home safely, everyone.
