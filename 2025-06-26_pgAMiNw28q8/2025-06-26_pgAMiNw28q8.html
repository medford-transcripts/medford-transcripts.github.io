    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=115.191s">Thank</a>  you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=117.532s">So</a>  our first agenda item is 400 Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=122.095s">It's</a>  a special permit and a site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=125.982s">It's</a>  an application from Herb Chambers at 400 Mystic, and it's 400 Mystic LLC for the site plan review to permit the construction of a new three-story structure to replace the existing three-story structure, renovation of the existing five-story structure, along with modifications to the existing parking, vehicular circulation, landscape, and utilities associated with the proposed Herb Chambers-Toyota Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=149.333s">In</a>  addition, the proposal requires special permits for the following motor vehicle-related uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=154.663s">That's</a>  H3, motor vehicle sales or rental of new vehicles only, accessory storage entirely with an enclosed structure, H4, outdoor motor vehicle sales and storage accessory to H3. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=166.245s">Commercial</a>  two, zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=171.126s">This</a>  meeting is a, this is an actual continued public hearing from June 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=176.947s">I'm</a>  going to ask the Medford City staff to do introductory comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=182.392s">before</a>  inviting the client to present a proposal.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=189.625s">Yes,</a>  so as you recall, this was a public hearing that was opened on June 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=194.228s">The</a>  applicant gave a presentation of their initial plans and in response to some staff concerns and concern to the board, they made some revisions to the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=210.16s">Staff</a>  was able to review those and <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=214.554s">We</a>  are recommending approval with some conditions, primarily some engineering conditions and traffic, but we'll go into those later. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=225.66s">But</a>  we can turn it over to the applicant team.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=232.383s">Who</a>  will be presenting for the applicant? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=235.225s">If</a>  you can introduce yourselves and you can begin your proposal or your presentation.</p>

    <p>[JjIkY7Z2rzw_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=246.73s">You're</a>  on mute, Frank.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=250.111s">And</a>  who's actually presenting?</p>

    <p>[JjIkY7Z2rzw_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=253.172s">Very,</a>  very sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=255.293s">Good</a>  evening, Chairperson McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=257.394s">Frank</a>  Marinelli, I'm Land Use Counsel for the Herb Chambers Companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=260.935s">It's</a>  good to see you all again since the hearing on June 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=264.717s">And</a>  as Danielle Evans pointed out, we have made and submitted plan revisions, which our engineering team, Gabe Crocker and Dave Newhall, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=274.0s">will</a>  go through with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=276.882s">Also</a>  here tonight, just for recap, is John Welch, who's the director of construction for the Herb Chambers companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=284.306s">And</a>  as I mentioned, the engineering team from Crocker Design, also our landscape architect, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=290.83s">Julie</a>  Lucier of Ryan Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=294.292s">The</a>  last time, just briefly, we summarized, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=298.113s">Evans</a>  just recited to the board, the site is about 4.86 acres. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=304.916s">It's</a>  in the C2 zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=306.954s">And</a>  we do need the special permits that the chair referenced in the legal notice, as well as the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=315.381s">We</a>  presented the last time that the existing five story building will be renovated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=323.607s">Four</a>  stories will be motor vehicle sales and showroom, as we've shown on the architectural plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=332.273s">And</a>  then we're replacing the current three story <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=336.189s">adjunct</a>  building with a brand new building, three stories, over 140,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=343.793s">The</a>  first floor is about 40 service bays. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=347.534s">And</a>  then the second and third floors are approximately 106 parking spaces interior on each floor is pretty robust landscaping as Julie went over the last time and the last time on June 5, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=363.98s">we</a>  did have the presentation of the architectural plans and also Gabe and Dave, our engineering team went through the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=373.144s">So</a>  at that time, as Danielle has pointed out, there were suggestions to <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=380.507s">make</a>  on, and those plan revisions were made, and Dave and Gabe will cover those. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=387.772s">Essentially,</a>  it was the handicap accessibility at the crosswalks of Mystic were improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=393.876s">We</a>  shifted the curb cuts on Fulbright further away from Fulbright and Mystic intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=400.841s">We</a>  adjusted that intersection so that it forces a slower vehicle speed when approaching the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=407.685s">We</a>  added a sidewalk along Fulbright Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=410.868s">We</a>  achieved the 5% interior landscaping requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=415.292s">We're</a>  going to be discussing with MassDOT the bus stop, which we'd like to enclosure across the street that we're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=422.958s">And</a>  we have two solar-powered pedestrian signals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=426.861s">We've</a>  added pavers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=429.023s">It</a>  was suggested the last time that we match the design in front of Colonial Volkswagen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=435.668s">And</a>  we did that, we made that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=438.47s">We</a>  have a landscaped area between the sidewalk and Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=442.571s">We</a>  raised the concrete crosswalk across Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=445.953s">We</a>  reduced impervious area and the solar we did achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=452.776s">We're</a>  proposing a solar on the new addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=456.417s">And</a>  we have about 57% solar coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=459.9s">So</a>  with that, with the chair's permission, I'd like to turn it over to Dave Newhall and Gabe Crocker of Crockett Design, and they can further describe these plan revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=470.789s">And</a>  then we're happy to answer any questions the board or the public may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=475.613s">And</a>  we appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=478.41s">Danielle</a>  Evans making herself available on July 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=483.691s">We</a>  had a work session on June 4th with Todd Blake and Daniel Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=491.314s">And</a>  then we had another work session on July 2nd and Danielle was on vacation out of state, but made herself available. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=499.676s">We</a>  appreciate that very much and hope that the plans we've submitted meet with the board's approval tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=506.338s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=511.946s">Thank</a>  you, Frank, for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=513.567s">David</a>  Newhall with Crocker Design Group, Civil Engineers for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=518.27s">So</a>  just to take Frank's summary to the next level, give you a little bit more detail of the changes that we did make. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=527.196s">So</a>  starting with the handicap accessibility and overall pedestrian circulation on the site and the changes that we had made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=536.663s">So</a>  previously, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=540.415s">We</a>  had shown modifications out front to the sidewalk and the curb cut on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=547.677s">We've</a>  modified those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=550.798s">Main</a>  thing being for the sidewalk that was along Mystic Ave here, we added in the landscape buffer to match what is across the street in front of the Volkswagen dealership. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=562.023s">The</a>  only spot in which it doesn't have the landscaping buffer is where the existing bus stop is that's going to remain as we had to show the concrete sidewalk going around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=574.23s">Additionally,</a>  we've added a raised concrete <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=578.812s">sidewalk</a>  at the entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=580.332s">It's</a>  very similar to, or it will be similar to all the existing curb cuts that are along Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=587.534s">So</a>  this will be at grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=589.414s">There</a>  won't be a ramp down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=591.015s">It'll</a>  stay the same slope going across. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=594.475s">We</a>  do have detectable warning strips at each edge of the sidewalk, just so for anybody crossing the sidewalk, they know they're coming up to an intersection where cars will be <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=608.477s">accessing</a>  and leaving the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=611.558s">Additionally,</a>  we added in this crosswalk here so now if there's somebody who is coming to the dealership they drop off their vehicle to be serviced and they're going to leave it for the day and use public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=624.842s">They</a>  can now exit the service area and come across using this crosswalk then we have a concrete sidewalk that will then <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=635.654s">bring</a>  you over to either this bus stop here or you can use the other crosswalk which we've added here at the Fulbright Street and Mystic Ave intersection and then come across Mystic Ave to access this second bus stop that's being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=654.241s">Additionally,</a>  we've added in a crosswalk to the rear of the property so we had a concrete <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=661.597s">sidewalk</a>  that wrapped around the entirety of the proposed addition on the last rendition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=666.881s">This</a>  one now takes it so if we have any service members who work at the dealership, their main area and locker rooms are back here, they can, they have now two options to walk to the bus stop, they can either come around the building along this crosswalk, which kind of leads them to not having the best ability here as this is more of an operational <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=689.501s">area</a>  or they can use this crosswalk here, come down our concrete sidewalk and then we have the added Fulbright Street crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=698.184s">We</a>  then have detectable warning strips and another crosswalk across this Fulbright Street curb cut that will bring you to the two bus stops that we had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=709.053s">Additionally,</a>  we had the two curb cuts along Fulbright Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=713.874s">We</a>  originally were opposing to keep those where they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=717.555s">Todd</a>  Blake had some very good comments about seeing what we could do to push those further away from Mystic Ave and from that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=725.477s">So</a>  we moved them as far as we could up the screen here and further away from this intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=733.243s">We</a>  also widened these curb cuts from where they are existing for better access onto the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=739.325s">So</a>  when we have car carriers access the site, they can come in, enter here, offload on site, and then be able to leave and exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=747.748s">Additionally,</a>  we aligned this curb cut as best we could with this back drive aisle, which mimics how <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=754.603s">the</a>  current site operates where the curb cut is more here and the drive aisle is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=759.045s">So</a>  it is a lot like how it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=762.767s">It's</a>  also wider. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=764.448s">We're</a>  proposing there was a utility pole here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=768.27s">We're</a>  just proposing to have two new utility poles that span across it to relocate that and be able to still have our power to our site come along here and route how it does today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=781.821s">Additionally,</a>  in terms of making this intersection safer by having this curb cut further away, we're proposing to have this be more of a T. So previously, this intersection, you could come around this corner fairly quickly just because of how it was just a smooth curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=803.414s">Now</a>  it's more of a 90 degree turn, so you have to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=807.843s">to</a>  come and access this curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=809.604s">So</a>  increasing the safety of pedestrians that might be using this crosswalk or vehicles leaving from this curb cut vehicle travel will be a lot slower than the existing condition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=823.034s">Additionally,</a>  on the Fulbright Street, we have the added sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=829.379s">When</a>  we did that, we didn't put it in <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=833.472s">leave</a>  the edge of pavement where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=835.153s">We</a>  pushed it into the edge of pavement so that we could keep our landscape buffer along our parking here and on the back side of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=843.818s">Additionally,</a>  we just continued this street edge down so then we gain some green space along the backhand side of this second curb cut, so reducing impervious within our site to add more green space as well than what we had previously proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=862.588s">Additionally,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=863.795s">for</a>  our landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=865.477s">One</a>  of the main things we heard was about this area over here and the sea of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=871.205s">So</a>  we've added in two landscape islands here we had a break just <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=876.562s">our</a>  stormwater design to make sure we have water going where it needs to go as we're treating it and that's properly functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=883.365s">So</a>  that's why there's two and there's a two foot break to allow stormwater to travel through one of our catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=889.028s">Additionally,</a>  we added a proposed paver walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=892.61s">So</a>  adding in to have better access for anybody looking to view the vehicles or in <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=899.828s">In</a>  case there is an emergency for fire safety, they have the landscape island plus the walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=905.351s">So</a>  it's double of what just the landscape area would be and help breaking up this area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=911.293s">Additionally,</a>  we've added in landscape islands along the front parking area that is along the Mystic Ave area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=919.757s">These</a>  changes help allow us to now meet that 5% requirement for interior landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=926.267s">And</a>  we also have the amount of trees being proposed for the site per the landscaping requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=938.098s">Additionally,</a>  on our access around the site, the pedestrian crossing here, we added in two signals, they'll be solar powered signals so we don't have to do any trenching within Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=950.315s">So,</a>  if somebody is coming to cross this parking lot, they'll just hit the button, it'll flash saying, hey, people are trying to cross and likewise on this side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=963.451s">Additionally,</a>  we also added in pavers and another location on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=968.72s">So</a>  we added this paver walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=970.522s">We</a>  also added some pavers for parking across from where you have the showroom entrance, and then also from the main dealership entrance here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=980.41s">So,</a>  getting less pavement and adding in more pavers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=984.514s">And</a>  then, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=986.565s">As</a>  Frank had mentioned, we provided the solar exhibit showing the proposed solar for the addition and for the total site to meet that solar requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1000.183s">Additionally,</a>  we did explore that option B that was discussed of when we have to go, we have a number of items that are within Mystic Ave, within the right of way that need to have mass DOT approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1015.051s">So</a>  we did explore and did provide the exhibit for the option B, which would be a right in, right out for this parking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1029.085s">Wait</a>  for this to load. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1030.647s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1036.154s">So</a>  this here shows that option B that we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1041.599s">to</a>  make sure we considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1042.96s">So</a>  we heard the feedback that one of the applications had to come back because they were forced to have write-in, write-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1050.665s">So</a>  we went back with our traffic engineers and this would be the option B for write-in, write-out if we're unable to have full access like we're proposing in the site plan set as it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1065.554s">We</a>  would keep this raised concrete sidewalk going across <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1069.527s">And</a>  then we would also add in a landscape island in the middle to enforce that nobody could be coming down Mystic Ave and try to make this left-hand turn or come out of the entrance and try to make this left. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1081.732s">It</a>  forces the traffic to be right out and then to be right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1087.394s">I</a>  think that would cover the changes we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1090.836s">And</a>  with that, we'd like to turn it over to questions.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1097.77s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1099.59s">I</a>  have a clarifying question on your plan B, if there was any feedback from Todd, the actual traffic engineer from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1110.452s">Daniel,</a>  do you have that information, if there was feedback on that?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1115.973s">Yeah,</a>  we were in the meeting when this was shown to us, and I believe that Director Blake <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1125.077s">didn't</a>  have any concerns with this scenario plan B in the event that it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1132.359s">We</a>  could put in some language in the conditions that it could be tweaked slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1143.642s">If</a>  it's the scenario that's to be taken, and if it has to be moved slightly, that it would not require <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1155.087s">a</a>  trip back to the board, but I defer to you all.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1159.428s">Well,</a>  the language can just cover that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1161.089s">It</a>  would have to be in coordination with director Blake and MassDOT to make sure that it was at the city and MassDOT's standards or something to that?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1173.713s">Yeah,</a>  I think some language to that effect that covers in case there's something <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1182.499s">that</a>  would need to be slightly modified. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1184.98s">But</a>  I don't believe that Todd had any misgivings about this alternative access in the event that MassDOT requires it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1199.247s">I</a>  just want to make it as simple as possible, but at the same time, clarify it so that it can actually move forward easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1205.67s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1211.943s">Are</a>  there any clarifying questions from the board before I open it up to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1229.79s">Peter</a>  Kelce?</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1231.851s">I</a>  don't have a question, but I think for <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1236.136s">regulatory</a>  reasons i need to attest that i did uh watch the hearing of the recording of the hearing of june 5th so as to be up to date on this project and be able to vote on it i just want to get that on the record before we move forward and forget about it thank you very much all right i'm going to go ahead and open it up for public comment um those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message danielle in the comments</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1263.398s">You</a>  can send an email to ocdmedford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1268.339s">Before</a>  providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record and remind all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1278.523s">However,</a>  if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1286.305s">Danielle,</a>  can you manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1293.972s">It</a>  doesn't look like we have any members on.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1299.177s">Madam</a>  chair, I don't see any raised hands and I have not received any written comments from the public.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.207s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1309.868s">And</a>  I think we can officially close the public comment period for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1315.932s">And</a>  so that brings us back to the draft recommendation and conditions so better understand what we are moving forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1326.881s">Again,</a>  if there's any questions or comments from the board at this time, before I move to motion or approve, are you understanding what we are working with now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1345.487s">And</a>  Danielle, for clarifications on the conditions in the offsite, I am not sure what offsite conditions, Director Blake, that have not been addressed to include with the draft conditions.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1366.909s">Yeah,</a>  I'll defer to Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1368.349s">If</a>  we think that it was everything captured on the plans, because usually we would put things in writing if it doesn't appear on the plans.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1377.872s">But</a>  because I was looking at that, well, while the while the applicant was presenting, I was looking at the provided layout plans just to check it against Todd's comments from the <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1391.158s">uh</a>  last go around and it seems that everything off-site is captured i think we will have to put something uh daniel as you said something in the manner of like if in just authorization discussions with mastod that something comes up that has to be changed that that can be run through todd and through pds without having to come back to the board assuming it's not a major change but other than that uh <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1421.808s">Other</a>  than that, it looks like everything Todd mentioned in his... Everything Todd mentioned in his comments were, in fact, captured in the plans, both on-site and off-site. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1436.213s">We</a>  will have to include some language for the off-site ones just because of the MassDOT approval that's needed in case MassDOT needs any changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1444.776s">But</a>  it looks like, at least in my view, that, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1450.933s">The</a>  RFB, the pavement markings, sidewalk on Fulbright, the curb radius on the corner at Fulbright, the bus shelter, and the accessibility are all in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1461.216s">So</a>  that covers the offsite stuff.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1467.057s">And</a>  so for the draft recommendations from previously, these have been rectified for the most part as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1475.94s">We</a>  had eight drafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1477.58s">And</a>  I want to make sure that we're on the same page with the proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1480.788s">What</a>  are the drafts? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1482.128s">What's</a>  the remaining conditions?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1486.189s">So,</a>  Madam Chair, regarding the engineering comments, Director Hunt was able to connect with City Engineer today about whether one of the conditions or comments was addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1504.314s">I</a>  guess this would be a question for the <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1509.641s">engineering</a>  team here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1511.302s">It's</a>  regarding the waterline service to the proposed hydrant located in the parking lot just south of the building, that the pipe should be reduced directly after the T and valve to limit the amount of stagnant water within the pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1524.974s">And</a>  then he also said the second gate is not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1530.559s">Was</a>  that addressed or looked at?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1534.552s">Yes,</a>  we did look at that and we've made the change in our plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1538.873s">We</a>  haven't resubmitted our utility plan yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1542.614s">He</a>  had some other some minor comments on just the stormwater aspect of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1546.995s">So</a>  we're just working through just comprehensively addressing his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1551.296s">We</a>  haven't received full comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1553.016s">We</a>  just want to make sure we got all the comments before we resubmitted but we have no issues with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1559.198s">The</a>  comments regarding the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1561.258s">and</a>  the hydrant line and the valves and addressing those as he had suggested.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1568.745s">Okay,</a>  then I would, through the chair, I would suggest that we, that condition remain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1572.548s">And,</a>  you know, prior or the applicant, you know, shall submit an updated utility plan that addresses the city engineers' comments and concerns per <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1590.742s">the</a>  email correspondence with myself.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1597.624s">So</a>  beginning from condition one, that was highlighted with control plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1602.825s">Plan</a>  modifications have been resubmitted but have control plans.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1611.587s">So</a>  the revised plans that were submitted the other week, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1620.982s">So</a>  all the plans should be updated, and I'll correlate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1636.428s">But</a>  I think that we could, it sounds like one of the plans that needs to be submitted that hasn't been submitted yet is an updated utility plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1645.432s">So</a>  I guess this is a question for the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1650.857s">Of</a>  the plans that were submitted, how many are outstanding that need to be updated so that we are referencing the correct plans?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1665.081s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1669.403s">For</a>  our civil plans, we'll have a C5 and C6 are our grading and drainage and utility plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1679.286s">So</a>  it's those two sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1681.536s">that</a>  will have some minor modifications just to address the comments received from Owen and the city engineering staff on our stormwater submission.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1697.084s">Yes,</a>  I think the control documents should be ones that we've received already. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1702.506s">And</a>  then as modified by <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1708.455s">the</a>  written conditions which would be incorporating the new utility plans when they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1716.079s">So</a>  I think we'll be covered there.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1730.086s">And</a>  then I'm just going to go through just to, so we're not, and then we came to number three on your end, requotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1738.84s">of</a>  the builder permit?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1742.502s">Yep,</a>  so that's one of our standard conditions that the entire decision be recorded, the registry of deeds, evidence provided before they're able to pull a building permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1755.507s">Then</a>  we'll have the traffic and transportation conditions regarding any of the off-site work, basically describing the <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1767.458s">Coordination</a>  with MassDOT and, you know, final approvals from Director Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1774.123s">Or</a>  we try to keep the approvals with the position, so the Director of Transportation or Traffic and Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1785.072s">And</a>  then language regarding the Scenario 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1790.837s">City</a>  engineers' conditions regarding the water line service. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1798.237s">And</a>  I believe that is all of any special conditions that we would need. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1805.6s">Everything</a>  else would be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1810.102s">Sometimes</a>  we do call out that linkage, that this project is subject to linkage.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1825.018s">Kirk</a>  house, are you taking down the new conditions or you, um, as we go along, I'm just curious.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1835.783s">As</a>  we've been discussing, I've been, uh, writing out based on the, uh, draft conditions that, uh, city staff wrote up and things we're discussing to kind of have a running list of the, of the conditions we will actually need.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1849.829s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1850.189s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1854.012s">And</a>  have we wordsmithed for that scenario? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1860.674s">We</a>  have to decide on language regarding the MassDOT access permit for scenario two?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1869.998s">Madam</a>  Chair, I believe we can do some wordsmithing after the fact, as long as the gist of the condition is conveyed and agreed upon by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1879.101s">And</a>  then I can work with the applicant's attorney <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1884.263s">sharpen</a>  up the language and make sure everything is correct and be interpreted by somebody who wasn't at the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1896.493s">That's</a>  going to be one of my questions, probably my only remaining question about the traffic and transportation conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1909.984s">At</a>  this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1914.11s">If</a>  we can do wordsmithing after the fact, as long as the general point gets across, what is the condition surrounding the, what's it called, the, yeah, the alternative, the scenario two? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1932.994s">Is</a>  there a separate condition for that right now, other than saying that should modifications be required due to mass-out approval that that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1944.253s">that</a>  further city approval of those changes would be delegated to the Director of Traffic and Transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1955.401s">Because</a>  would that not cover the offsite modifications as well as the scenario to modification to the driveway?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1964.247s">I</a>  think it'd be good to call it out as a separate condition regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=1972.691s">you</a>  know, in the event that the access permit isn't approved.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2350.202s">And</a>  I will, with that, yes.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2354.16s">I</a>  want to thank Pam, but I also just wanted to give you all an update on another project, just as an FYI.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2360.464s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2362.105s">The</a>  raising canes, which went through site plan review with this board, it's getting pretty close to being finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2371.011s">There's</a>  some pavements and markings that are not done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2374.313s">They're</a>  still waiting for a line from <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2377.615s">uh</a>  national grid to come in but I did a preliminary walk through before signing the occupancy you know going through with the checklist from the conditions from this board and so I would just invite any of you if you want to take a look over there informally if you care to you know if you think I didn't see anything other than obviously not all the paving and markings are in yet um but I just <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2401.082s">I</a>  really dislike going to a company that thinks that they're 100% and finding things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2409.754s">So</a>  we've been encouraging the department heads to take a look now and just see as they're hitting the last bits. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2416.023s">there</a>  anything that we dislike or think isn't correct and I just thought I would share that with you all if you care to take a look if you do ever see anything in that site or any other site where you say that's not how I remember it like how I remember we approved it you are always welcome to reach out to us directly and say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2438.493s">And</a>  it is much preferred that you do it before they actually open, because we still have authority before we give them the occupancy permit.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2446.958s">It</a>  looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2447.578s">I</a>  have to take a closer look for the bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2449.239s">But</a>  I go to that stop and shop all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2450.64s">And</a>  I've been watching it go up.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2453.301s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2454.122s">I</a>  go to that stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2455.022s">I</a>  go over there a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2456.043s">And</a>  my only question is, I mean, this has nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2459.004s">This</a>  doesn't take away from it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2460.485s">But</a>  they have fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2462.006s">I'm</a>  like, what's with all the fans in their driveway? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2464.948s">What</a>  is that?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2468.178s">Oh,</a>  tell them, Gabe, because you went with me and you're familiar with their operations from other locations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2473.68s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2474.961s">Basically,</a>  it's for like when it's the drive through a lot of the staff, they'll go there if it gets busy and just to keep them cool.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2482.864s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2483.364s">I</a>  remember that Apple stand out there with iPads.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2487.826s">I</a>  remember that when we were talking about when we were approving them, they were talking about their like congestion management. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2493.848s">If</a>  the drive through gets really busy is they'll just send people out with iPads.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2499.07s">That</a>  is pretty amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2500.892s">Gosh,</a>  my husband is going to get a kick out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2503.574s">I</a>  just want to know, what did you approve those fans for? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2505.676s">We</a>  didn't approve fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2507.998s">I</a>  don't know what that means.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2510.18s">What</a>  is fun is obviously the national grid line isn't in, so they don't have electricity yet, but you do sometimes watch them just from convection, just kind of spinning on their own.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2520.659s">So</a>  they have like temporary construction electricity, but not their, not their official reel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2526.502s">And</a>  there's certain things they can't do until their final connection is connected.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2530.565s">I</a>  mean, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2531.305s">And</a>  I mean, I'm pretty sure these are just blowing in the wind slash circulating air because they're all going to different, they're all going different directions at different speeds.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2540.671s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2540.991s">I</a>  definitely thought that like sort of like a wind chime, chime, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2544.413s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2546.257s">I</a>  mean, if I was looking correctly, and I'm usually just there going back and forth to stop and shop, it looks like, in a very smart move for New England, it looks like they've got fans, and in between the fans are heat lamps.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2559.209s">There</a>  was another whole year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2561.211s">There</a>  was another very small project that I don't remember honestly, if this board provided guidance to the city council, because the energy and environment committee talked about it extensively is at stop and shop, putting in some electric chargers that are, will have video screens on them as like advertising to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2584.85s">And</a>  they'll be very close to the stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2588.252s">to</a>  the front entrance and that was actually approved by the city council a year ago or more than a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2596.014s">They've</a>  just come back around saying they want to install them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2601.015s">I</a>  honestly thought that project had gone away, but you'll also see that coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2607.037s">There'll</a>  be two vehicle charging stations for free at stop and shop.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2613.818s">Add</a>  supported EV charging.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2617.897s">Opportunity</a>  cost.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2619.878s">Well,</a>  I mean, it's better than the gas pumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2622.259s">They</a>  have ads on them, and you still have to pay for the gas.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2624.561s">I</a>  was going to say, the ads are already on the gas pumps, aren't they? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2628.063s">I</a>  don't know about Stop and Shop, I can't remember, but I know they're everywhere else.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2631.564s">Yeah,</a>  they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2633.365s">For</a>  future meetings, it'd be cool to hear updates on projects we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2636.907s">This</a>  was really cool to hear, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2639.949s">Thank</a>  you so much for sharing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2640.929s">But</a>  whether it's H-Mart, Bank of America, I'm trying to think of other projects that we've come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2648.347s">Obviously,</a>  there's a ton on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2652.891s">I</a>  will tell you that those two are ones that I get asked a bunch about, and we haven't actually heard from those. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2660.418s">Bank</a>  of America is under construction, but they're not close enough to occupancy to be talking to us yet.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2666.623s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think, last time I was over by Wegmans, I don't think they're above the fence line yet that I could see.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2672.227s">Yeah,</a>  and I know the H Mart's not open. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2674.529s">I</a>  drive up by it probably more than you all do.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2678.112s">My</a>  dentist is right next door and I keep, that's the only thing I know and I go over there and I don't see it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2682.555s">They're</a>  still alive, they're still <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2687.458s">moving</a>  forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2688.339s">Well,</a>  they're busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2688.939s">They're</a>  popping up all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2690.259s">They</a>  opened the Davis Square one already, but that was it.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2694.04s">They're</a>  popping up all over the place because they took over the old Be Fresh in Davis Square.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2698.102s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2699.062s">So</a>  that was easier for them to move into that space since it already fit out as a food market. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2704.564s">So</a>  this is a gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2705.564s">So</a>  it's taking more time, but the project is still very much alive and it's going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2713.427s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2715.176s">Our</a>  interns will be glad to hear that they were asking about HMART and that there's a rumor that it was not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2724.362s">But</a>  glad to hear that that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2726.203s">And</a>  they're actually, they're telling us that tough students will be over the moon about the Raising Canes, that they're taking the T all the way into the city and back out to go to the one by BU. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2737.71s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2738.27s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2744.045s">I</a>  realize college kids really love chicken, all kinds of chicken.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2748.55s">The</a>  other one that we're working with is the Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2753.373s">And</a>  we've actually compiled a list from all the departments of things that they were needed and sent that to them, which they found to be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2764.561s">And</a>  they are shooting for a mid-August opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2768.684s">It</a>  is unclear from their construction schedule, their status, if that's actually going to hit that timeline.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2778.29s">That's</a>  optimistic, given what I last saw of their building.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2781.594s">I</a>  saw that they had a sign up in the rear today.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2785.818s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2786.559s">And</a>  if you didn't see it on social media, they announced a chef, that the chef from Snappy Patties is going to be, is going to run a, basically a restaurant, food services at Great American Beer Hall.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2800.953s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2802.067s">Yeah,</a>  there had been a question when they came in front of us as to exactly how they were going to do food services and now the in-house show.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2810.034s">I</a>  remember them saying they were going to do it, but they weren't sure exactly who and how.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2813.036s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2816.339s">Very</a>  entrepreneurial.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2820.494s">And</a>  Wackling Fort has applied for their first demolition permit to start taking down buildings so they can, and I wasn't 100% clear that they were, how close they were to actually doing demo, but they've applied for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2834.364s">So</a>  they are moving along.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2836.205s">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2836.565s">Love</a>  to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2837.246s">The</a>  one I can't vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2840.989s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2841.829s">It</a>  started, it started just because Niche worked on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2844.611s">And</a>  then I actually ended up writing a lot of that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2847.593s">In</a>  fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2852.011s">Todd</a>  had to let me into some cabinets.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2855.954s">You</a>  can't come out of them.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2858.655s">I</a>  can't take anything out of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2860.396s">That's</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2861.517s">Unless</a>  you want the intersection of Boston Ave and North Street to not work.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2871.215s">And</a>  if there's ever you want to like, if you want to email me in advance that you want updates for particular projects, we can also reach out where things stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2879.92s">So</a>  a quiet night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2883.642s">But</a>  yeah, but thank you all.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2886.063s">Quiet</a>  when it's a thunderstorm that's starting over here.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2890.566s">Is</a>  it really starting? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2891.986s">I'm</a>  on my bike tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2893.687s">Yeah,</a>  you should probably go home.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2895.649s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2896.97s">I</a>  will.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2898.191s">It</a>  looks like I could at any moment, but I don't have anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2901.733s">I</a>  need to be imminently.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2906.816s">Can</a>  I finish that thought, Jackie, and answer your motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2910.679s">Motion</a>  to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2912.14s">I'll</a>  make the motion.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2913.621s">I'll</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2915.943s">So,</a>  Vice Chair Emily Hartman? <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2918.384s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2919.505s">Peter</a>  Kiles?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2920.866s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2921.494s">Ari</a>  Fishman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2922.776s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2923.416s">Pam</a>  Ariansky. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2924.358s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2925.819s">Sally</a>  Akiki. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2927.541s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2928.222s">And</a>  myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2929.644s">I'm</a>  an aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2930.585s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2931.466s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2933.469s">Good</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pgAMiNw28q8&t=2935.571s">Let's</a>  get home safely, everyone.</p>
