    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=0.291s">And</a>  this is really one of the most important things, when they went in to do what they said they were going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=6.257s">And</a>  this is a problem that I have seen many times, that there's some, you know, when you walk through the doors of the statehouse, they hit you with some kind of electric voltage, so you forget what it is you wanted to do, and you become <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=21.788s">dominated</a>  by the idea like how do I not piss off the speaker or how do I, you know, all these internal things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=28.595s">And</a>  frankly, I've had many conversations with progressives who got elected and then they tell me things like, well, I can't really do it because I would annoy the speaker and I have to bring home some goodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=40.067s">for</a>  my district, well, I think reps should serve their district, but more than anything, they should serve our state and serve our country and our ideals. <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=49.022s">And</a>  I would much rather that somebody did that than they came home and they told me they got, you know, $85,000 for a streetlight somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/fnlPUPfwqrQ&t=56.975s">We</a>  need streetlights, but we need our values a lot more.</p>
