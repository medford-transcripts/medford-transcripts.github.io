1
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:08,353
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one of the participants is asked that we sign in with what our relationship is to the project.

2
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:13,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 602 Peter Quinn is here.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,791
[SPEAKER_01]: We can start the presentation for you.

4
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:30,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And then any questions that you have, we can answer them after the fact.

5
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:34,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Kathleen Desmond, I'm with Touchstone Law Offices in Redding.

6
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent the owners of the property located at 421-423 High Street in Medford.

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyril Hughes is the manager of 417-423 High Street LLC.

8
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:51,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's here with me this evening, Galena Penlova may be joining us but we can get started.

9
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're all on the call.

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,294
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the owners of the members of the development team team are here as well.

11
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:07,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Sullivan was solving engineering from Woburn Peter Quinn of Quinn architects and Milton you as well of Quinn architects in some of all.

12
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:15,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a, as a plenary, this meeting is being recorded, um, so that it will be available on the website.

13
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:22,069
[SPEAKER_01]: If you folks want to refer to it at any time, um, there was just to preface it.

14
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:31,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had sent out notices on December 31st to the post office, went down to the post office and I hand delivered them, um, to the post office clerk.

15
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:35,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, um, they were placed in the wrong bin.

16
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:42,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And the notices weren't delivered I happened to get them back today and I notified the city of that.

17
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it was on the website and I understand that they did do a robo call in my letter actually I think was posted on the city calendar as well, but the meeting will be available for those who, who want to share it with others.

18
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:11,513
[SPEAKER_01]: By way of background, for those of you who might not be familiar with the project site, 421-423 Hyde Street is a location of the former Sincota Funeral Home and includes the parking area located behind it.

19
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:15,334
[SPEAKER_01]: The existing structure is a two-story mixed-use building.

20
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:20,936
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the funeral home, the structure did include a second floor residence.

21
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:24,937
[SPEAKER_01]: The combined parcels provide an area of approximately 11,420 square feet of land,

22
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:35,741
[SPEAKER_01]: The portion of the parcel on which the funeral home currently sits is situated in the C1 commercial district that allows for mixed use.

23
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:44,305
[SPEAKER_01]: The back portion of the lot is also the parking area that was used by Sincada that is located in a single family district.

24
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:54,916
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the project proposes to construct a four story mixed use building in place of the existing structure with a gross floor area of approximately 13,882 square feet.

25
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:05,729
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial space will be located on the first floor and as well as one of the nine bedroom nine residential units.

26
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,929
[SPEAKER_01]: The units will be two bedroom units of varying square footage.

27
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,371
[SPEAKER_01]: As most of you know the site is located within walking distance to the West Medford commuter rail.

28
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close to shops and parks and also some of the elementary schools.

29
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the developers excited about this project and

30
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:40,672
[SPEAKER_01]: believes it will be a nice fit for the neighborhood, bringing in some commercial use, increasing the flow of traffic to and from businesses, and also providing necessary housing in the city.

31
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:49,277
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I will turn the project over to Peter Quinn, and he can run through the plans for you.

32
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter.

33
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.

34
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:59,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Quinn, Peter Quinn Architects in Davis Square, Somerville.

35
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been with this project for a very long time.

36
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you I recognize from the many hearings we had with the historic commission in order to get demolition approval.

37
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is substantially the same building that I showed them after a lot of work trying to alter it to their

38
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:30,965
[SPEAKER_05]: design comments and so if it looks familiar that's the reason.

39
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:42,918
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've done is provided a mixed-use building where the ground floor has a retail space facing the street and then in the back of the first floor

40
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:50,236
[SPEAKER_05]: and particularly we have nine residential units.

41
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:53,597
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all two bedrooms, some are two baths, some are one.

42
00:04:54,657 --> 00:05:04,260
[SPEAKER_05]: They're mostly on the small side, you know, 875 square feet to about 1200, which is substantial, but most of them are smaller than that.

43
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And three of them have decks or porches, the rest do not.

44
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:11,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're

45
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: They're nice units front and rear so you know you get a lot of windows, as you can see in this in this image and way we laid this site out, we are using.

46
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:34,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The land that the funeral home sits on right now, there is a right of way between us and our neighbor to the left that gains access to the parking lot in the rear.

47
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's being reused.

48
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only one way in for us.

49
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:45,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other way out is on the other side of the building, which you can see a little bit of pink driveway.

50
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,933
[SPEAKER_05]: or give you an idea how it feels on the street.

51
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:07,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a nice substantial base with brick columns and behind that storefront windows and doors.

52
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:13,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And then above that sits our block, which is the residential units.

53
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:20,402
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get into the building for residential purposes at the corner on the right.

54
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you see this cove in the back on the left

55
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,628
[SPEAKER_05]: that comes from the parking area.

56
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:29,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So between those two areas, you can get anywhere into the building.

57
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the middle, there's a core that takes you up to the building.

58
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:38,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And another 3D view here.

59
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:45,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a little bit higher than the buildings around it, but not substantially.

60
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:52,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of that is because we are introducing kind of a breakup of the massing

61
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:17,164
[SPEAKER_05]: with the historic commission and a very nice storefront window and openness on the front, trying to add a good retail feature and some texture to the streetscape along the high street.

62
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:28,273
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more or less the last commercial retail building along the whole high street strip in West Memphis.

63
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:43,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you later, I have a shadow study, which I can show you.

64
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:47,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, first, I just want to continue with the streetscape.

65
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:51,688
[SPEAKER_05]: This gives you an idea of how these look in two dimensions in relationship to each other.

66
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:55,589
[SPEAKER_05]: The upper one has a couple of buildings in each direction.

67
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Our building is right here.

68
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:01,704
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's quite a variety of buildings.

69
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:05,347
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go up and down the street, there are all kinds.

70
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:09,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of them, you know, meet with two to three stories, a few four stories.

71
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,794
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, there's a surprisingly large number of four stories in the area.

72
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We just mapped them out on this.

73
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:21,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them are clustered around the train station, but not all.

74
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:26,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see what else.

75
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:34,122
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the layout, just to give you an idea, first with the cyclone, we did engage in a landscape architect.

76
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:45,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're looking at here, the sort of blue barbell shape in the lower part of the page is the footprint of the building at the ground floor.

77
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,193
[SPEAKER_05]: And around it is a pool of water.

78
00:08:52,798 --> 00:09:00,322
[SPEAKER_05]: have a driveway around it to the purpose of fire access, as well as that's our egress out back onto the street from the parking lot.

79
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:11,827
[SPEAKER_05]: In the parking lot itself, we made an effort to really enclose that with a landscape buffer in all directions facing our residential neighbors.

80
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:22,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's quite a few plantings, both on this right-hand side where we have about five feet, six feet of planting space.

81
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,140
[SPEAKER_05]: and then on the other we'll have more.

82
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:32,243
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a bike storage area, which is enclosed also by landscape on the left-hand side here.

83
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:45,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And the usual way people come in if they park here would be to place their car in their parking spot and then walk into the building on the side of the cove that I mentioned before.

84
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems to work pretty well.

85
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:49,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And when people will leave here,

86
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:53,389
[SPEAKER_05]: go right out through here and go right back out into the street.

87
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:57,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Street has good visibility in all directions.

88
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:01,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We have introduced a street tree that is not there now in the front.

89
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the city would like us to do more, we certainly could do that.

90
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point, this is what we're proposing.

91
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:18,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And this does show somewhat lightly some of the other trees in the area that our neighbors have.

92
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:25,751
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, the whole parking area I think will be pretty well landscaped and enclosed.

93
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:30,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, going on to the floor plans.

94
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:36,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a small commercial space in the front, which is this dark blue area.

95
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about 785 square feet.

96
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,024
[SPEAKER_05]: To give you a sense of what that could be, would be like a small personal trainer or, you know,

97
00:10:50,393 --> 00:11:03,567
[SPEAKER_05]: craft or retail sales type place, not suitable really for a high volume by pedestrian traffic kind of retail store.

98
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:12,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the back, as I mentioned, there is a two-bedroom, two-bath, and it has its own

99
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:26,397
[SPEAKER_05]: one bath each.

100
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:32,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally on the fourth floor, as you can imagine, these are premium units.

101
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:40,188
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two bedrooms with two baths each, and they have substantial roof decks for their use as well.

102
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are quite nice premium units.

103
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:54,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Elevations and materials, we use a clapboard, as I mentioned, we have brick on the base, fiber cement, a metal panel or equal type system on the roof,

104
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:06,353
[SPEAKER_05]: home windows, along with casements and transoms throughout the building.

105
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Traditional kind of detailing.

106
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll see how that moves around the building.

107
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:20,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually are retaining some of the stained glass from the existing funeral home and inserting that in our stairway.

108
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:25,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And back in the building, again,

109
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:31,287
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this has to withstand traffic in the light, so we have a brick base back there as well.

110
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:44,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, the side where the cove entry is, bookings and windows, you know, kind of an orderly pattern for those residences on that side.

111
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:46,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I showed you this earlier.

112
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:54,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, now I know some of you want to be concerned about lighting,

113
00:12:55,169 --> 00:13:00,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have two primary lights around the building.

114
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:06,239
[SPEAKER_05]: We have building wall sconces that are dark sky compliant.

115
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those are mounted on the side of the building.

116
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:15,226
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't cast light out toward neighbors, only to the ground.

117
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's done intentionally.

118
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do need to light it so that people can get around the building safely.

119
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,083
[SPEAKER_05]: In the parking area itself, we have bollards.

120
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:32,928
[SPEAKER_05]: They're approximately three feet high, and they are also all down light.

121
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll create pools of light around these parking spaces.

122
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no large light canopy that's casting light into the yards.

123
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all kept underground intentionally.

124
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,942
[SPEAKER_05]: In the front, we have more substantial light to light that.

125
00:13:53,517 --> 00:14:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: arcade that we have in the front between the columns and the retail building.

126
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's appropriate for the street light.

127
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Now onto the shadow study.

128
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:11,744
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a little hard to read, but I'm happy to send this to people if they want to look at it further.

129
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:16,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way we do the shadow studies is first we look at the impact of the existing building.

130
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:19,207
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the shadow that it creates?

131
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And then

132
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:29,792
[SPEAKER_05]: we look at what does the new building change, and those changes in shadow are done in the yellow.

133
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:35,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So to orient you, the building to the left, the three-story is over here, right there at that location.

134
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the right is 417 High Street, the two-family.

135
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And then back here is 10 Park.

136
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:53,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So this first study is what you would see either in middle March or middle September when we have the equinox.

137
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a medium case scenario.

138
00:14:56,736 --> 00:15:02,478
[SPEAKER_05]: In the morning, we do cast shadows out toward our parking lot and toward our commercial neighbors.

139
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:10,920
[SPEAKER_05]: A tiny bit goes into the backyard, I think the first residential building.

140
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:16,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Then by midday, that has completely rotated and is almost all

141
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:33,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the late afternoon, three o'clock, or beginning of the late afternoon, where all the shadow is directed toward 417 High Street.

142
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:37,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be a typical spring or fall situation.

143
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:43,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there certainly is, it's impossible not to have some impact, but you know, I think

144
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,636
[SPEAKER_05]: the building but also because of the orientation where it sits on the street.

145
00:15:54,937 --> 00:16:09,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Now in the summer, as you would expect with sun as high as it is, at those same times there's very very little shadow and almost all of it is on site except for a little bit early in the morning and late in the day.

146
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty straightforward.

147
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: In the winter, when you know so much is in shadow anyways,

148
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:25,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We do create a shadow early in the morning that heads out over the parking lot and then goes into the landscape in the back of some of the yards there.

149
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And then midday, we have the shadow rotates around.

150
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:35,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It does go into 10 Hammond's backyard.

151
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that will rotate around by 3 o'clock.

152
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:38,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost all on 417.

153
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:58,980
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also quite a bit of shadow everywhere at that time.

154
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I've covered everything pretty well.

155
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:12,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you may wonder where the building sits in relationship to the existing funeral home.

156
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:18,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So here is a survey which shows you the existing funeral home.

157
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:26,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're coming up much closer to that driveway on that side.

158
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:42,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And on this right-hand side, we actually, to the right, we are up against that as well.

159
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:49,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we occupy between these two property lines.

160
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:56,540
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an easement on 417 for this driveway that allows us to get out to the street.

161
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,061
[SPEAKER_05]: That was when the lots were split, that's what the agreement was.

162
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:09,724
[SPEAKER_05]: This gives me a sense of the texture of the landscape, the landscape architecture.

163
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:13,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Selected a lot of native plants.

164
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,744
[SPEAKER_05]: which we have to think about these days.

165
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:27,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And so let's just say that is it.

166
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

167
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:35,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathleen, I pass it back to you.

168
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:43,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do you want to, while Peter has his screen up, Peter, maybe you could go to the engineering pages.

169
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

170
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:48,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack, do you just want to give an overview of the engineering on it?

171
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:49,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

172
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:53,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, if you don't mind going to sheet two, the proposed site plan.

173
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

174
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone, my name is Jack Sullivan.

175
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm owner of the Sullivan Engineering Group.

176
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:04,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Peter covered pretty well the site circulation, what we're looking to achieve.

177
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one way circulation around the building.

178
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:17,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone knows we're basically utilizing how the previous use was utilized with parking to the rear.

179
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:29,211
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a total of eight conventional parking spaces at the back of the lot, six compact car spaces, and we're providing one handicap parking space which will be van accessible.

180
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: The building will be serviced with a new domestic water line, and we'll also have a fire protection line servicing this building.

181
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:44,267
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to reutilize the existing sewer service.

182
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be video inspected.

183
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's structurally sound, the size of it is sufficient to handle the retail use of the nine two-bedroom units.

184
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,092
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as drainage, we look to do a low impact

185
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,552
[SPEAKER_02]: low impact drainage analysis for this site.

186
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a redevelopment project.

187
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, we were looking to remove about 666 square feet of pavement.

188
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:21,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be almost a 7% reduction in impervious surfaces from what's existing today to what will be built.

189
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:30,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in removing the pavement areas off of the rear parking lot

190
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:34,983
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting in a bioretention cell, which is basically a rain garden.

191
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:36,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a planted area.

192
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:49,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Stormwater can filter off the parking lot, go into that bioretention area, and then there'll be an overflow out into what presently is a stormwater basin.

193
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:54,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some investigation to the back left corner of this property.

194
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,171
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a drainage area there that consists of

195
00:20:58,834 --> 00:20:59,735
[SPEAKER_02]: riprap stone.

196
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,416
[SPEAKER_02]: We dug down about five feet deep.

197
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:02,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all stone.

198
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I was out there during a heavy rain event.

199
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,199
[SPEAKER_02]: All the water is getting to that area now.

200
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:10,961
[SPEAKER_02]: There's good soils, but there is a high groundwater table.

201
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:25,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking to utilize that location and by removing some impervious surfaces, putting back grass, some crushed stone where the bike spaces are going to go in the bioretention cell.

202
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:32,863
[SPEAKER_02]: We're providing some treatment to any of the water coming off the parking lot before it gets to that storage basin.

203
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see, yep, thank you, Peter.

204
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna be the bioretention cell.

205
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:55,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, that's just a shallow depression that's planted so that when water moves through, anything collected like sediment, any impurities can be filtered out

206
00:21:56,702 --> 00:22:01,463
[SPEAKER_02]: through that area, and then before it moves off for final discharge to the basin.

207
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:06,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as site grading, there's really no site grading changes.

208
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:15,325
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to look to pulverize the parking lot, repave it and restripe it.

209
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: There's existing curbing in place, so water that moves off is collected and channeled along that curbing, then moves towards our drainage area.

210
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a net reduction of water moving off the site.

211
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:39,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, really no regrading, but just basically be a glorified repaving and restriping project.

212
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it from the civil side.

213
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:46,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it back to Kathleen if there's any questions after I can try to answer them.

214
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:55,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I now have a huge appreciation for Dennis McDougall and doing this there's a couple of people who are in the waiting room that just came in so let me admit them.

215
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:05,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I have received some questions on the chat and certainly people are more than welcome to, to ask their questions.

216
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:09,277
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, verbally.

217
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:18,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But with regard to the chat questions, the two questions I have, three questions I have, what percentage of footprint is occupied by the building?

218
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can answer that.

219
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,281
[SPEAKER_01]: The lot coverage is 29%.

220
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe looking at the zoning, the existing Sincota building.

221
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:33,516
[SPEAKER_01]: was 28%, so it's clearly within the lot coverage requirements.

222
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:40,577
[SPEAKER_01]: The second question by Tom Lincoln was why are no solar panels on flat roof?

223
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:47,219
[SPEAKER_01]: This project is subject to the solar panel ordinance and an evaluation will be done.

224
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:54,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's being calculated into what's gonna move forward and, you know,

225
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,945
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be, it will follow the process it's a building that that has to comply with the solar ordinance.

226
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:07,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last question he had was, is this a lead building led.

227
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,832
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, why not, and how many.

228
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,594
[SPEAKER_01]: How many trees are being being cut down.

229
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:19,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the distance to the nearest residents house in terms of the last question which is five, the distance.

230
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:32,833
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a right of way on the right side of the building which is essentially 20 feet, and that that doesn't touch the house so you're more than you're probably 2122 feet away from the existing house on the.

231
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,731
[SPEAKER_01]: on the right.

232
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:43,456
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to the house on the left, there's a 10 foot right away, which runs here, and that's 10 feet.

233
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:49,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably 11 or 12 away from this structure, which is office space.

234
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:57,728
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the residences, I think, Peter, what was the measure on this particular number 10?

235
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:03,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So the red lines that you see are all 100 foot radius.

236
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:06,189
[SPEAKER_05]: radio.

237
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:12,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of the houses, you know, this our new building would be kind of in this location.

238
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:17,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is showing two L shaped structures in the parking area.

239
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,560
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what used to be there.

240
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a single family to at one point, those were torn down some years ago.

241
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:33,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But from this location right here, to any other residential structures, you know, we're probably

242
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:37,515
[SPEAKER_05]: just using this as a scale, this hundred foot right here.

243
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I can actually do that.

244
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:40,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give me a minute.

245
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to get a sense of the dimensions.

246
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: From our new building to this neighbor at 417, that's going to be about 40 feet.

247
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:23,138
[SPEAKER_05]: From, we're about at this corner right back here to 10 Hammond.

248
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,843
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about 60, 60 feet at the closest corner to 14 Hammond.

249
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Over 100.

250
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the other direction.

251
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:43,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And our building ends approximately right here.

252
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:45,830
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an outbuilding, so just go to the main building.

253
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,151
[SPEAKER_05]: This is showing 150 feet.

254
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at 9, more than 146 feet.

255
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:50,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So substantial distance.

256
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:07,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And then to address Mr. Lincoln's question as to whether this is an LED building.

257
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have, we have not.

258
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursue that, but you know, I would do the buildings all the time, gold, platinum, and others, and we also do passive house projects.

259
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,434
[SPEAKER_05]: This would easily qualify for LEED gold.

260
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:40,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really just a matter of paperwork and cost involved on the administrative side.

261
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:48,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But because it's a redevelopment site in an area that's transit rich, you know, it would actually

262
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:58,549
[SPEAKER_01]: last question was how many trees are being cut down?

263
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:04,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hang on just a sec.

264
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:08,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look at that landscape plan.

265
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:09,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's the record of it.

266
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:16,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see any cut here.

267
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:17,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it goes to them.

268
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:22,785
[SPEAKER_05]: All the trees that you see back there are actually off property.

269
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,651
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't see any getting torn down, getting cut down.

270
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:32,231
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think everything stays.

271
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:47,194
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, you know, we took the approach that there are some very nice trees back here that we wanted to supplement, but we're not doing anything that would jeopardize them.

272
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:53,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think we do kind of working with those existing trees

273
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:57,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you can see that it's like an existing Norway maple that's right off site.

274
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:03,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually considered invasive, but of course it's not on our property.

275
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, I know, a lot of people don't believe that.

276
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:16,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's other trees, fruit trees and so forth.

277
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:18,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that- The answer is zero.

278
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:28,320
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's what I have in the chat for questions.

279
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to navigate.

280
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:34,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So you folks can all unmute yourselves.

281
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:39,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Paul Spielman, I think, had some questions that he wanted to ask.

282
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:47,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if you just give me a note in the chat that you want to ask questions, and then we can just kind of do it that way.

283
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,827
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're muting.

284
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Tom, you can.

285
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:52,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

286
00:29:54,733 --> 00:30:00,155
[SPEAKER_06]: If he could undo his screen share maybe each other would be great.

287
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:07,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it might be that he wants to use the screen share to to answer some questions.

288
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:09,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, let's see where it goes.

289
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:18,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know if there was, you know, the views that we see from the front include the look of the building.

290
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,340
[SPEAKER_06]: The rear one was just a architectural drawing.

291
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a picture of the rear of the building?

292
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what I would see from my house on Hammond Place.

293
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:31,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the one that's number 14 Hammond Place.

294
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

295
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:35,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have rear elevations.

296
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do a 3D model.

297
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have a 3D model of the rear?

298
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

299
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:43,151
[SPEAKER_06]: You showed a rear elevation already.

300
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I could get that to you.

302
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:47,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to.

303
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what I'm going to see.

304
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:52,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pleased.

305
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pleased with the lighting that you're talking about.

306
00:30:56,684 --> 00:31:14,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very displeased with the lighting that's on the back of the Armand glass building, which when the parking lot was originally proposed, we were promised by Sinkati that there wouldn't be additional lighting shining into our yards from the back of the Armand glass building.

307
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is a huge bright light right now.

308
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a really polluting light.

309
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:26,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize that has nothing to do with your project, but that's something that I want the neighbors to hear that we're not happy with.

310
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:35,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want you to know that we spent a lot of time working with a lighting consultant and have actually done calculations of all the foot candles on all the spots on the site.

311
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're very confident that we don't have any substantial off lighting on the other properties.

312
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:45,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you'll be happy with the lighting scheme.

313
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:53,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet, if you're walking around the building, you'll feel safe because of the light on the ground, shining on the ground where it belongs.

314
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim seems to, what's the height and depth of, is that a lighting question, Tim?

315
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Height and depth of the street level arcade.

316
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, let's get to that at another time.

317
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:19,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, how much higher you said it's not much, not much higher than the than the accompanying buildings, how much higher in the other company buildings are always peaked roofs.

318
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:22,146
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a block structure.

319
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:23,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

320
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:30,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you take it, you know if you take it at the lowest okay so you're, you're here you're looking at.

321
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's that the placement of your cross your horizontal line.

322
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:44,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, is what the view kind of is above that is what's being diminished.

323
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now this fourth stories does step back.

324
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:53,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, this chorus line here be more dominant.

325
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's intentionally done.

326
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:58,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that in the 3d view.

327
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:13,717
[SPEAKER_05]: a cornice line, similar to what, you know, the yellow building has.

328
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:25,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, almost all the buildings up and down the street, as you look, have some sort of cornice line along the second or third story.

329
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:27,103
[SPEAKER_05]: This is second here, second here.

330
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:37,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here, I mean, this is, couldn't get a plainer building, but basically it's three stories plus a very generic low slope roof.

331
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:43,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it seems like most of the other buildings, even the ones you pointed out as four story buildings, have a three story.

332
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:44,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

333
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:52,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Inhabitants and then the rest is just a peak truth, except for that for that one box across the street.

334
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:53,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

335
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not gonna say that was our model.

336
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

337
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, we don't want to commit the sins of the past but yeah,

338
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:19,255
[SPEAKER_05]: crown right at the top, but next to it, this old mansard, you know, has a real nice cornice in great shape.

339
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, you know, this is kind of our model right here.

340
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a very ugly building, actually.

341
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:26,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

342
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:33,881
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see that it had some nice bones at one point, you know, it's got a beautiful dormers up there.

343
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are actually arch windows.

344
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they've been taken out, but you can imagine what they

345
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:42,817
[SPEAKER_05]: during the century.

346
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:45,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And this whole bottom has just been filled in.

347
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:50,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's something to be done here at some point.

348
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any affordable housing units coming?

349
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:57,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathleen, you know the answer.

350
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:57,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's one, right?

351
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:02,434
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable housing units in this particular structure?

352
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:03,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

353
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:07,759
[SPEAKER_01]: The requirement is, I don't believe that there is an affordable unit.

354
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:10,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, because we don't cross the threshold.

355
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,543
[SPEAKER_01]: The requirement is 10 units that affordable units are.

356
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

357
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:24,572
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I will say is that given the size of the units, I think they'll probably be a really attractive price point if they're for sale units.

358
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:29,729
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're not too large and not too small.

359
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Two bedrooms is a professional building with easy access to the team.

360
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:51,336
[SPEAKER_06]: The fence that now exists, a fairly new chain link fence in between 417, is that the property line currently?

361
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:53,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mark where you're

362
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That marks the easement line.

363
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:04,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, go back to this example.

364
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The property line is this area plus the back.

365
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a granted easement on the 417 property of 18 feet width.

366
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:23,353
[SPEAKER_01]: When the property was conveyed, that easement area was reserved.

367
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:32,380
[SPEAKER_01]: to 421 High Street so that they can use that for all uses that are associated with parking and driveway and landscaping and buffer.

368
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:39,065
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only restriction is there's no temporary or permanent structure that can be placed on that easement area.

369
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So the chain link fence does mark the end of the easement?

370
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:45,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

371
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:45,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

372
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

373
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:49,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give somebody else a chance, please.

374
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, do you wanna?

375
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:55,149
[SPEAKER_01]: You're unmuted, so.

376
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,310
[SPEAKER_01]: In my what?

377
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,152
[SPEAKER_01]: You're unmuted, so you can speak if you'd like.

378
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:02,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm a little new to this.

379
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:03,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I live up the hill.

380
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:11,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, this building looks like every other new apartment building built in Bedford in the last five years.

381
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the brick.

382
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:15,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's way too big.

383
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:21,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got a flat roof because you're maximizing the number of units here.

384
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:25,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the units ought to be cut down to about six, in my opinion.

385
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:38,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little skeptical of the traffic with those narrow alleyways coming onto a very, very busy high street, which is already a kind of a death trap for pedestrians.

386
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:44,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Going there myself many, many times a week.

387
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:50,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I worry about what a building like this will look like in 50 years.

388
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'll be here, but somebody else will be.

389
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the brick will look fine, but I wonder about the other materials.

390
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:09,709
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at the apartments being built or have been built along the Malden River, Lumiere, over by the Wegmans, et cetera.

391
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:11,970
[SPEAKER_04]: They look okay now, but

392
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:13,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

393
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder about the aesthetics.

394
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,844
[SPEAKER_04]: This building kind of looks like it was dropped from the sky into West Medford in terms of scale.

395
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be permitted with our archaic zoning system here in Medford, but I don't think it really does much justice to the site.

396
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:38,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing I was wondering about

397
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly no expert on drainage, et cetera, but if you plan on improving the drainage, why aren't you using a pervious surface rather than just slabbing the parking lot with traditional asphalt?

398
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:59,723
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, in fact, using pervious pavement.

399
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:03,144
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what all this kind of pinkish look is.

400
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:04,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me just ask this.

401
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:14,894
[SPEAKER_04]: My assumption is that this building has, it's none of my business, but my guess is this building has a tremendous return on investment.

402
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:31,168
[SPEAKER_04]: With nine units, given the fact the property was sold for a couple of million dollars, but half of it was already recovered, or maybe a little less than half with the sale of two family house, you know, it looks,

403
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:34,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a big leap to me here.

404
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm certainly in favor of additional housing, but I think this building is too big.

405
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:47,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You can show all the shadow studies you want, but psychologically, it looks really very large.

406
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:55,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very different, looks very untraditional, and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me.

407
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:25,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure in terms of questions I understand you know what your opinion is with respect to the building but with respect to the questions that you have as as to the building is it what why there's any pavement I mean the only area of pavement is the 24 foot access in and out of the driveway parking spaces.

408
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:34,340
[SPEAKER_01]: of the size of the building, it's within what's permitted in the zone.

409
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,861
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly isn't anything more than what is.

410
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:46,566
[SPEAKER_01]: The units are a mix that provide both small units that people can afford and a few larger units.

411
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:50,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also very close to rail, which I think mitigates.

412
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:54,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And the traffic study, when they did the traffic impact study, didn't take into account what

413
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:05,887
[SPEAKER_01]: what the rail being in close proximity would mean to the project and it still fit within the parameters.

414
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:12,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not something that was going to create an inordinate amount of traffic on on high street.

415
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:15,912
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small variety commercial space.

416
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something larger you're going to have.

417
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:20,578
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic in and out.

418
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:32,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the traffic study found that it would be less traffic than you would have with a funeral home where it's residences and people are, it's basically overnight use.

419
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,368
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't people going out on day trips.

420
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:40,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was maybe four trips during peak hours that they anticipated coming in and out.

421
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:46,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Also with the driveway, it's a one-way drive.

422
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not gonna have

423
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:56,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little reluctant, if you could hold on one second.

424
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:59,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I have this view and I'm not sure.

425
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:01,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anyone familiar with an Okie's iPad?

426
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I want to allow that in.

427
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:12,829
[SPEAKER_01]: It popped up on my screen earlier and it's kind of late in the meeting to allow that in.

428
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone know anyone who would have that?

429
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,806
[SPEAKER_01]: tag, I'm kind of inclined not to admit.

430
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I think it may be spam.

431
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:42,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, you know, I don't know what beyond that you have questions concerning, I understand what your, your position is on on on what you think of the look of the building.

432
00:42:49,468 --> 00:43:00,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will get those rear views out to the neighborhood the next day or two.

433
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:08,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Pompeo asked the question, how do vehicles behind 425, 427 High Street exit?

434
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And now will they now go behind the proposed building and out over the row of the two-family house yet?

435
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite

436
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:18,453
[SPEAKER_01]: certain.

437
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:29,322
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, I think, yeah, they have the use of this driveway in both directions.

438
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:39,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would violate the one way rule of that going in?

439
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the one way rule is imposed on the residents of this building, our building.

440
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,714
[SPEAKER_05]: not to exit that way, but to go around the building the other way.

441
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:53,695
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't make somebody else do that as well.

442
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:59,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's relatively low use, but it's a good point.

443
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:03,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask another question?

444
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:12,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, the people from Almond Glass use the parking lot a lot.

445
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:15,108
[SPEAKER_06]: They park their vehicles there.

446
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:16,248
[SPEAKER_06]: They do work there.

447
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: They make a lot of noise there.

448
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Would they be restricted from this parking area 100%?

449
00:44:21,853 --> 00:44:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably using it because no one's telling them they can't at this point, right?

450
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:40,948
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm saying is I'd like somebody to tell them that when this project happens, I'd like somebody to be telling them that they cannot because they take advantage of us.

451
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:45,418
[SPEAKER_06]: They take significant advantage of us as residents.

452
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:49,160
[SPEAKER_06]: My property is diagonally touching the parking lot.

453
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:58,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're there at seven o'clock in the morning with loud voices out in the parking lot, foul language.

454
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:04,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really appalling the amount of noise we get from our Montglass people.

455
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:11,188
[SPEAKER_01]: We can probably send out a notice sooner rather than later in that respect.

456
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:15,804
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't have any legal right to use that parking lot.

457
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:19,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I would encourage you to please do that, please.

458
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the lawyer, right Kathleen?

459
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,150
I am.

460
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, I'll follow up with you.

461
00:45:27,614 --> 00:45:29,996
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have your contact information, I'd love to have it.

462
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:32,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I can put it in the chat.

463
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:33,779
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great, thank you.

464
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:44,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone else have any, at least it can be.

465
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,290
[SPEAKER_01]: The parking lot is zoned residential.

466
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is zoned residential.

467
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:53,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will require zoning relief.

468
00:45:56,575 --> 00:46:01,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we know who controls the lighting behind the Arlmont Glass building?

469
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that is significantly affecting our property.

470
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.

471
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:21,805
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big bright light right in the middle of that building that illuminates the whole parking lot at this point.

472
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:28,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any knowledge as to.

473
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:33,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't either.

474
00:46:33,435 --> 00:46:40,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

475
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.

476
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:41,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Tim Conant.

477
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:54,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, could you just tell me the height of the arcade and the depth from the sidewalk, uh, from the, from the front of the arcade to the, um, the entry doors on the arcade.

478
00:46:54,705 --> 00:47:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

479
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the front of the arcade to the storefront is the sum of one, six and three, four.

480
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:12,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, four, 10, almost five feet.

481
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then the height of it.

482
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:46,252
[SPEAKER_08]: 9-7.

483
00:47:49,853 --> 00:48:01,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any plans for planters or anything to sort of soften that arcade a little bit and make it a little more pedestrian friendly?

484
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:02,716
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea.

485
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:06,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have that in the plan.

486
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:08,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought there were some in the landscape plan.

487
00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:09,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just check.

488
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be mistaken, but I thought there were.

489
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:19,533
[SPEAKER_05]: see seasonal planners.

490
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:21,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

491
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:27,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Which can take a whole range of things.

492
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:34,879
[SPEAKER_06]: There's currently a plastic fence around the parking lot side and rear.

493
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:36,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my property.

494
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a cheesy looking fence.

495
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:43,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, a piece of it fell down for a while.

496
00:48:43,193 --> 00:48:44,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It took a long time to get replaced.

497
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that fence going to be maintained or is it going to be a nicer fence?

498
00:48:48,396 --> 00:48:59,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's something that could be, you know, we could work with our landscape architect on and try to come to some agreement.

499
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:06,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we call for it to be, to remain because I think it's unclear exactly on which property it is.

500
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:12,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, looking at that.

501
00:49:14,863 --> 00:49:15,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

502
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: That impacts my property, particularly in that I'm the abutter all along the back side of the property.

503
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:24,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

504
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:27,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

505
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:31,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just understand which one.

506
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 14 Hammond Place.

507
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

508
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:35,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

509
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:37,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

510
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:39,052
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got this big chunk right here.

511
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:39,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

512
00:49:41,877 --> 00:50:09,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter with respect to that initial question about was it was it this property in particular they were asking where the access was on the right of way or was it 17 because there's also a passageway here if that was the question I wasn't clear I'd ask the question and maybe I had the number wrong was he referring to 417

513
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a passageway.

514
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:16,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

515
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

516
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:21,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they have access through that passageway as well, but they may.

517
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:24,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

518
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:28,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is for force for force or 25 for 27.

519
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:30,708
[SPEAKER_06]: For them to be passing on the left side of their building.

520
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:32,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

521
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're saying?

522
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:34,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

523
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to drive by and look at it.

524
00:50:37,878 --> 00:50:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a fence there now, but they park their trucks in that space in between the two buildings.

525
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:50,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the right way prohibits that, but I'll take a look.

526
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:58,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, could you talk a bit about the materials on the exterior of the building?

527
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:00,128
Yeah.

528
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be a brick veneer with cast stone detailing.

529
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:28,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have fiber-spread panels with some detailing on it, creating a place for sideboards or any retail space.

530
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:33,672
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of the building has a variety of

531
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:43,520
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber cement clapboard, which is the substantial blue area.

532
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:50,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And then to the right at the corner and near the entry, we have a fiber cement paneling system.

533
00:51:52,767 --> 00:52:06,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the roof, we call for either a metal or similar type of aged look, you know, maybe with copper patina or something like that up on the fourth floor level.

534
00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:16,512
[SPEAKER_05]: The windows themselves are double-hung, probably fiberglass with transoms.

535
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a few locations where we use a casement window or awning.

536
00:52:24,456 --> 00:52:27,718
[SPEAKER_05]: The windows down below are also storefront windows.

537
00:52:27,738 --> 00:52:34,201
[SPEAKER_05]: They could also be fiberglass as well in this kind of sizing, but the entry itself would be aluminum.

538
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Two entries.

539
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:42,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the basic materials.

540
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:43,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

541
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:44,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

542
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:54,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to mention metal railing as well.

543
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:56,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Steel railing.

544
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, probably aluminum.

545
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:04,489
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question.

546
00:53:04,629 --> 00:53:10,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Tom Lincoln had another question concerning the landscaping, and I think it's the building, how that will be maintained.

547
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:22,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, there's requirements in the documents with the special permit that require that the association maintain those documents.

548
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:30,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I would anticipate that it would be a requirement.

549
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:31,746
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to the building,

550
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:48,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're gonna be owned by people who have an interest in maintaining them and there'll be an association and I would imagine that there would be a schedule of maintenance associated with that.

551
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:59,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Stephanie had a question and Stephanie, I'm not sure if you were here at the beginning of the meeting when I extended my apologies for

552
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:00,896
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mailing.

553
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:06,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I had mailed and stamped 100 letters to go out to abutters.

554
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:13,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually delivered them to the post office in Reading on December 31st in the morning.

555
00:54:13,546 --> 00:54:20,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And today they were delivered back to my office with attempted not delivered, no forwarding address.

556
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:26,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my assistant go down to the post office today and ask,

557
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:39,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Why that happened, I think in retrospect, I probably would have been better off not mailing them on December 31st and not actually going down to the post office and handing them to someone because they ended up in the wrong bin.

558
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:44,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently when they get sorted, they got sorted out and rejected.

559
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:45,272
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he told me.

560
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:54,320
[SPEAKER_01]: He also indicated that we could rip the peel off of them, but as it was three hours, four hours before the meeting, there wasn't much that we could do in that regard.

561
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,102
[SPEAKER_01]: The letter was posted on the Medford calendar.

562
00:54:57,723 --> 00:55:00,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that robo calls went out as well.

563
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:04,328
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my 30 years of practice that hasn't happened, but it happened.

564
00:55:04,408 --> 00:55:06,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not, you know, much I can do about it.

565
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I took every precaution to try and get them in the mail early.

566
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:13,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And I handed them off to the post office didn't throw them in a in a mailbox.

567
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:15,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize for that.

568
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,863
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to the notice in concerning demolition, I believe the building department has a requirement that we notify

569
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:37,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Before demolition is a whole number of steps that have to be taken before commercial building is demolished so I'm, I'm certain that you will get notice of that it's not something that I do something that's required through the building department.

570
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,861
[SPEAKER_01]: and I may have one new message.

571
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:53,684
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of variances that will be needed, currently I think Steve Pompeo has that question.

572
00:55:55,804 --> 00:56:05,147
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it may to some extent be determinative of where we are in the recodification of the zoning code.

573
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:06,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently we have

574
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:17,887
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 parking spaces, the requirement is 20, 18 associated with the residential units and two related to the commercial space.

575
00:56:18,988 --> 00:56:31,435
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some request or some possible modification of how many parking spaces are gonna be required per dwelling unit.

576
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:33,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may change.

577
00:56:34,056 --> 00:57:01,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if the project is at the zoning board level after recodification, it may very well be that parking is not a variance request, it's a special permit request taking into certain factors, such as how close in proximity you are to public transportation, what you have in terms of public friendly uses, such as bike racks and things of that nature, commuter passes.

578
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:10,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So the parking may or may not be required, will probably require a special permit in any event.

579
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:17,838
[SPEAKER_01]: The front yard setback and the side yard setbacks are also required.

580
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Those areas don't include the easement areas.

581
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:28,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Peter showed you before, when he outlined what the lot was, those easement areas are not taken into account on the side yard.

582
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:48,215
[SPEAKER_01]: There is 10 feet on one side and I think 20 feet on the right hand side when the requirement being, I believe, 21 feet because of where the lot lines are, the side yard will need relief from side yard setbacks and also front yard setbacks.

583
00:57:48,596 --> 00:58:00,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Open space is also another required variance and that is a function of what the requirements of open space are.

584
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:11,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this project exceeds the landscape requirements, but open space requires that you have a 15 by 15 plot of land that you can call open.

585
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:14,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also is determinative of grade.

586
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:21,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the main variances that we'll be looking for.

587
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:30,106
[SPEAKER_01]: There also may be a variance required on that back lot as to use this parking lot, but I've got to look at that a little more closely.

588
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:33,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers your question.

589
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Paul.

590
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:43,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we as butters get notified of the hearings on those variances?

591
00:58:44,414 --> 00:58:45,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

592
00:58:45,654 --> 00:58:59,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So the requirement is that when we get to the Zoning Board of Appeals, there's no requirement that notices go out on the Community Development Board hearing, but they are on the calendar.

593
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:03,689
[SPEAKER_01]: the city calendar as to when those meetings move forward.

594
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:08,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can certainly notify you if you send me an email as to when that hearing is going to take place.

595
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:13,551
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to the zoning and the special permit hearing, that's a public hearing that requires notice.

596
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:18,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So all abutters within 400 feet will obtain notice of that hearing.

597
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:27,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, there's a requirement that a sign be placed in front of the property indicating the date, time, hearing, and what relief is being sought.

598
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I have further questions about that plastic fence and the border between my property and the parking lot, who would I address those questions to?

599
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:44,512
[SPEAKER_06]: You can address the questions to me.

600
00:59:45,073 --> 00:59:54,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter indicated that the landscape architect would be taking that into consideration, but I'd like to get more than taking that into consideration as far as a response.

601
00:59:54,776 --> 00:59:56,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

602
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:58,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you want to direct

603
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:09,575
[SPEAKER_01]: To direct questions to me, I can take those questions and send them on to the team and get you responses to those questions.

604
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:18,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathleen, there's a difference between questions and assurances.

605
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:28,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to get assurances that the border between my property and the back of the parking lot is gonna be more attractive than it is now.

606
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:40,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, any plans that we submit to the Community Development Board and anything that is ultimately determined by plans is set forth on the plans.

607
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:44,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And any variant special permit that's granted is subject to those plans that are submitted.

608
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:53,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can certainly have discussions about that and what works and what doesn't work and incorporate that within the plan.

609
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're required to go by what the plans are.

610
01:00:56,011 --> 01:00:59,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I was saying was,

611
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: and this may be helpful, Paul, I think at some point it would be a good idea to meet with the landscape architect and the owner and just kind of walk the edges and talk about, you know, the impact landscape-wise and what, you know, making sure, you know, showing you how we're enhancing the landscape there.

612
01:01:23,595 --> 01:01:26,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And this subject to this, you know, fence can come up at that time as well.

613
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's appreciated.

614
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:31,152
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a right time for that.

615
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:34,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm going to get anybody out there in the middle of winter, in the middle of COVID.

616
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:38,036
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will keep that in mind.

617
01:01:38,136 --> 01:01:42,278
[SPEAKER_05]: On most of the projects that we do, this happens as a matter of course.

618
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:45,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's appreciated.

619
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Good fences make good neighbors, some poets said once.

620
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:52,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a time frame on this, Peter?

621
01:01:54,543 --> 01:02:03,627
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of filing, we'll probably be filing within the month for the Community Development Board and Zoning Board of Appeals hearing.

622
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:14,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the filing occurs, there's then a 35-day period where the department heads weigh in from the city as to what their requirements are.

623
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:20,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that's met, and it really depends at that point on the Community Development Board schedule,

624
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:26,379
[SPEAKER_01]: when we meet, but it's probably a month and a half, 45 days from the filing.

625
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:33,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the Community Development Board hearing, it then goes to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

626
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:39,703
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the special permit grantor in addition to providing the various variances that you needed.

627
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:47,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how many meetings the Community Development Board goes, generally those meetings can occur in the same month.

628
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:51,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Community Development Board has been meeting at the beginning of the month.

629
01:02:52,775 --> 01:02:58,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ZBA meets on the last Thursday of the month, at least I should say at least that's how they've met.

630
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:04,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new board going from a five member board from a three member board.

631
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,383
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may vary a little.

632
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:10,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I answer your question?

633
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:11,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

634
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:14,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's probably... Is it next summer?

635
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:15,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it next fall?

636
01:03:15,648 --> 01:03:24,592
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's probably... Well, in terms of construction, that's different than hopefully the permitting process, three to four months.

637
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:28,994
[SPEAKER_01]: to get out of out of the zoning board hearings.

638
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:34,577
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're successful to get a decision, move the appeal period.

639
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:48,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that point, you know, building plans have to be submitted, I would think, you know, probably year to 18 months is probably the, you know, if everything goes according to plan is probably where you'd end up with shovels in the ground.

640
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:49,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

641
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:01,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, someone had a question as to who the landscape designer is, and I started on it.

642
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:07,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's Verdant out of Brooklyn, V-E-R-D-A-N-T.

643
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, Steve, with regard to your question,

644
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:22,291
[SPEAKER_01]: as to the right, the common way right, we have to look at that.

645
01:04:22,331 --> 01:04:24,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe so.

646
01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:44,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some variances that, there is an entrance exit drive variance that's gonna be required based on the, it's 10 feet and 20 feet on one side, but whether that, you know, that will be something we'll have to look at a little more, I'll have to look at a little more closely.

647
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone else have any other questions?

648
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one question.

649
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:07,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be any parking for that retail location at the ground floor?

650
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they have one or two spots behind the building?

651
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:20,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way we discussed this with the building official,

652
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:30,899
[SPEAKER_05]: you're allowed to make an accommodation for a small retail, up to one and two spaces, using the same spot that a residential would.

653
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:40,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a manner of management that, you know, because we have quite a few normal residential spaces, probably not all of them will actually be used.

654
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:46,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the retail can use it during the day on assignment.

655
01:05:47,446 --> 01:05:51,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a possibility of providing some limited parking, especially for

656
01:05:51,862 --> 01:05:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: employees.

657
01:05:53,563 --> 01:06:09,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, honestly, the people who would frequent this retail spot, for instance, if it were a personal trainer, would probably be parking on the street for 45 minutes and then moving on.

658
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:26,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that's typically also vetted through the process, you know, with the Community Development Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals as to how they want to treat those spaces.

659
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:34,626
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think that will be certainly most of them will be dedicated to residential use.

660
01:06:35,486 --> 01:06:43,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is some flexibility under the code, as Peter indicated, for shared spaces where one uses primarily overnight and one uses during the day.

661
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

662
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:57,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone else?

663
01:06:59,337 --> 01:07:00,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we all set, folks?

664
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:04,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I appreciate your attendance.

665
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really, really.

666
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And great questions.

667
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:09,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that a lot.

668
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:13,224
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions that you want us to respond to, I put my email in the chat.

669
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can send me the questions and then I'll send them off to the appropriate party to provide you with an answer.

670
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:23,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And feel free to give me your email addresses as well if you want notice of things.

671
01:07:26,263 --> 01:07:26,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

672
01:07:27,249 --> 01:07:27,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

673
01:07:27,852 --> 01:07:28,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night folks.

674
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:29,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay warm.

675
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:30,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

676
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

677
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:31,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.
