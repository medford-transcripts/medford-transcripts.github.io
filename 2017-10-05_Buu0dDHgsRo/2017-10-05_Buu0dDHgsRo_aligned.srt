1
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,869
Nineteenth regular meeting of the Memphis City Council.

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,570
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,551
Councilor DelaRusso?

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,111
Present.

5
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:15,532
Councilor Falco?

6
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:15,952
Present.

7
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:17,053
Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:17,933
Present.

9
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:18,853
Councilor McKernan?

10
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:19,734
Present.

11
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:20,674
Vice President Marks?

12
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:21,394
Present.

13
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:22,815
Councilor Scarpelli?

14
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:23,255
Present.

15
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:24,496
President Caviello?

16
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:25,456
Present.

17
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,617
Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:59,259
17-419, offered by Vice President Michael Mox, accommodation for Mae Marbrek, 25 years of recognition as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gym.

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,720
Vice President Mox.

20
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:25,882
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:35,949
It's an honor and a pleasure to represent this council accommodation to what I refer to as a dear friend of mine for a number of years.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:46,377
I met Mae probably back some, and I don't want to date you Mae, back some 25 years ago through different city organizations.

23
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:54,202
And I think it's only appropriate after all these years and all the different organizations that Mae has belonged to,

24
00:01:54,824 --> 00:02:01,886
that she received the recognition, not that she'd want, because May, if you know May, May never looks for recognition.

25
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,967
May's always behind the scenes.

26
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:11,289
She's the engine driving what goes on in this community, and never once looked for any type of praise or accolades.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:19,572
And even tonight, I want to thank Council President Caviello for making the phone call to say, hey May, can you come down to Tuesday's meeting?

28
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:20,473
Multiple phone calls.

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,593
Multiple phone calls.

30
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,362
Can you come down to Tuesday's meeting?

31
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:28,203
And I think May may have had an idea or not, I'm not quite sure.

32
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:45,771
But needless to say, I would at this point, I'd like to recognize, I served the last few years on the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium, alongside May and a number of other real activists in the community.

33
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:51,634
And at this point, I would just like to recognize the board in which we sat on

34
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,087
Cindy Watson, co-president.

35
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,409
Mike Cerullo, co-president.

36
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,671
Keith Barry, member of the board.

37
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,113
Representative Paul Donato, member of the board.

38
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,555
Susan Fairchild, member of the board.

39
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,857
Ken Kraus, member of the board.

40
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,399
May Makibrek, member of the board.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,603
And Russ Rossetti, member of the Friends of Chevalier board of directors.

42
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:20,028
You know, May, little known fact, was a Mustang Hall of Famer.

43
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:21,896
back some years ago.

44
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:22,776
Right, May?

45
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,037
Where is May?

46
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:24,677
May, where are you?

47
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:25,858
You're up over here.

48
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,620
Mustang Hall of Famer.

49
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:34,183
May was the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gymnasium.

50
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:36,064
Cachet.

51
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:47,331
It was the brainchild of May, meeting with a few people in the community regarding the arts, that put together Cachet, the Coalition for Art, Culture, and Healthy Economy.

52
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,233
And, you know, May won't say it, but

53
00:03:51,056 --> 00:04:04,164
Those were May's ideas originally back many, many years ago to put organizations together, to link the community up, and pull in all different backgrounds in order to move this community forward.

54
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:13,889
While promoting the arts is a main goal of CACHE, it also aims to bolster the local economy at the same time.

55
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:20,593
Looking ahead, we are hoping to create a more vibrant arts and cultural scene in Method, which in turn

56
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,931
will promote economic development, May Makibrek said.

57
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,975
That part of it cannot be overlooked and it is what we feel sets the group apart.

58
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:36,158
We all work together as equals with one big exception, John Anderson said.

59
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:43,763
May Makibrek is really the driving force and she has been so enthusiastic and youthful and full of ideas.

60
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:49,827
You need a person like that if a coalition such as this has any chance of surviving, which it is

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,191
a good sign for us.

62
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,694
May served as the President of Springstep.

63
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:03,618
She also served on the Board of Directors for Brooks Estate's Land Trust.

64
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:08,622
May was recognized by the Chamber of Commerce as Citizen of the Year.

65
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:31,269
Who can forget May's article which appeared in the March 14, 2014 edition of the Method transcript honoring Method Olympic champion Mary Carew Armstrong for National Women's History Month, or the countless letters to the editor in which May offered support to local organizations.

66
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,093
As we all know, May was part of a lot of different civic groups, but she was also very vocal on the issues.

67
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,729
And May, she wasn't a wallflower.

68
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,069
She let it be known.

69
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,790
She let it be known where she stood in an issue.

70
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:55,554
And if there was an issue that was confronting the residents of this community, you better believe May was at that podium.

71
00:05:56,614 --> 00:06:00,736
I remember the night the Medford Public Library was experiencing roof leaks.

72
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:02,757
And guess who was at the podium?

73
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:21,772
We have very, very dedicated people who are here tonight, members of the staff of the library, just hoping that the ceiling tiles in the building that they're working wouldn't fall in on their head, said Mae Mockeybrook, president of the Medford Coalition for the Arts at the council meeting.

74
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:23,212
This is disgraceful.

75
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:29,054
We often remember the debate with art funding in the budget.

76
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:38,470
The city never funded arts in the budget, and a few years ago, this council offered a resolution to put arts in the budget, and May was at the podium once again.

77
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,934
I think it's fair to say we're in an arts revolution, said May Makibrek.

78
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:44,335
Medford has changed.

79
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,717
We are no longer a streetcar suburb.

80
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,498
We're a vibrant community.

81
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,243
We have a great deal to offer, and there is an arts movement going on at the present time.

82
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:01,019
Several years back, we had the Brooks Estates bond proposal that was before us.

83
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,600
Quite a contentious issue for some.

84
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,582
May, again, was at the podium.

85
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:12,865
The Brooks Estates has been treated by the city like an orphan, said Meffitt resident May Marky-Brick.

86
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:19,469
In 2010, community leaders were pushing to build up the Chevalier Theater.

87
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,132
May stated, now that the problem is not so much the condition of the theater,

88
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:31,472
which like any property requires ongoing maintenance, but the underutilization of the Chevalier Theater, she said.

89
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:44,419
How much longer are we going to talk, continue to see a valuable asset in our community be underutilized and waste the opportunity to have Chevalier Theater become an engine of economic development in Medford Square?

90
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,503
These are just a few of the things that I recall May working on over the years.

91
00:07:53,076 --> 00:08:01,099
as a community activist, as someone who wholeheartedly cared about the children of this community.

92
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:09,343
You couldn't find anyone more responsive to the needs of the Boys and Girls Club, which is on Forest Street, than May.

93
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:15,205
The arts movement, I think, May was the art movement for a number of years.

94
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,248
And it's only appropriate tonight that we take the time to

95
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,853
And I see this audience is filled.

96
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,634
It's not many times that this audience gets filled.

97
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:39,237
And it's my distinct honor and pleasure to thank my friend, May Makibrek, for her many years of dedicated service.

98
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,858
And I know some members of the council want to speak.

99
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:44,838
I'd just like to read the citation.

100
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,639
And May, we have a few more speeches, if you don't mind.

101
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,100
There's a nice comfy seat next to you if you want to sit down.

102
00:08:53,028 --> 00:09:11,281
It says the Meffitt City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Mae Makibrek in recognition of her 25 years of distinguished service as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gymnasium, signed May 16th by Council President Richard Caviello and Vice President Michael J. Mox.

103
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,248
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

104
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:57,694
I'm just going to do a little word checking and make sure that I did say all those things.

105
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:06,219
Well, this is a very special moment, and I appreciate all of you have come here this evening.

106
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,761
When President Carviello called me,

107
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,193
about coming here tonight.

108
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:15,195
I thought he was going to ask me to be on a subcommittee.

109
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:20,839
And I was going to have to say, I'm sorry.

110
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:39,572
At any rate, in accepting this very, very wonderful tribute, I also have to give a lot of credit

111
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:52,634
to all of the people who have been working on the Friends of Chevalier for the past 25 years, those past and those present, some of which are here in the chamber tonight.

112
00:10:54,275 --> 00:11:09,362
And thinking back about that early time, I would just like to remember a few of our dear friends who are probably looking down on us this evening.

113
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:20,369
And that would be Teresa Cerullo, wife of Michael Cerullo, and John Nostry.

114
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,611
And there may be others that I hope I haven't overlooked.

115
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:37,973
Dick Oba, who were very, very much a part of the early days when we

116
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,439
establish the Friends of Chevalier.

117
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:50,805
And over the years, uh, the group has worked very diligently and very quietly, but has accomplished a great deal.

118
00:11:51,886 --> 00:12:03,593
In fact, in addition to being advocates for the theater and the Boys and Girls Club for these many years, they also raised a considerable amount of money.

119
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,215
And believe it or not, that would be

120
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,439
more than $350,000.

121
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:37,573
One of the major grants that was given to the Friends was from the Cummings Foundation, which is a local philanthropic

122
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:44,750
philanthropic organization by Bill Cummings and his wife.

123
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:52,052
As you know, the property here adjoining us is owned by the Cummings people.

124
00:12:52,993 --> 00:13:02,076
So they gave $100,000 to add staff to the Boys and Girls Club.

125
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:06,357
And I have to say that I'm very, very proud

126
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:12,592
that the friends were a big part of the Boys and Girls Club coming here to Medford.

127
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,715
They have been extremely successful.

128
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:29,284
They still have a waiting list in spite of the additional money that they received from the Cummings people to add instructional staff.

129
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:36,529
So we have been quietly working away over the years, and I just hope that

130
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:46,631
Uh, those of you at some time may consider giving a small contribution because it's always very, very welcome.

131
00:13:47,591 --> 00:14:02,016
And I want to, uh, recognize as council marks did the current members on the board and to wish you good luck going forward.

132
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:03,297
Thank you all very much.

133
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:22,577
Thank you, Vice President Marks.

134
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:27,680
I don't want to put you on the spot any longer, Mae, but I think a few of us just want to say a few words.

135
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,263
Councilman Marks did a great job announcing you and taking quotes.

136
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:33,823
That was great.

137
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,931
From my standpoint, you've been a true leader in this community.

138
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:51,293
You've done such wonderful things that so many people have benefited from, families and every resident in this community has benefited from your work with the Chevalier and Cachet and everything else you were involved in.

139
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:59,894
The fact that you did it because you love this city and you wanted to make it better means a lot and I look up to you, May, and I wish you the best and good luck in your retirement.

140
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:00,454
Thank you.

141
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:03,715
Councilor Del Rosso.

142
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:05,658
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

143
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,666
I want to also congratulate you, May.

144
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,352
I want to thank you for your energy.

145
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:26,896
Your selfless devotion to the city, your generosity to give of your spirit and your energy and yourself to so many commitments is tough, and we thank you.

146
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:31,778
And I hope you keep going and going till you get it right.

147
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,039
So keep at it.

148
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,940
Practice makes perfect.

149
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,421
I'm not taking the city.

150
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:37,701
Good.

151
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:39,262
Thank you.

152
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:40,182
Councilor Felico.

153
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:41,583
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

154
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:45,678
May, I just want to say thank you and congratulations.

155
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:50,540
You have been a true role model when it comes to civic engagement and people getting involved.

156
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,942
And you're someone that people can look up to.

157
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:57,303
I mean, you've been involved with so much throughout our city.

158
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:02,165
And I just want to say thank you for your years of involvement and for your contributions to the community and good luck.

159
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:02,606
Thank you.

160
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,587
Council President Caviello.

161
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:07,051
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

162
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,072
May, you and I have been friends for many years in this community.

163
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:11,972
You and I have worked on a lot of projects together.

164
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:14,293
And I don't know what to say.

165
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:21,915
You know, you've always been ahead of the curve on a lot of issues when people, when they weren't popular, you were there to push them.

166
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:25,376
I was there when you received your Citizen of the Year award.

167
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,016
I was very proud to be in the room that night.

168
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,257
And again, I don't think you'll ever retire.

169
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:42,041
I know, though you say you're going to retire, I know we'll be seeing you around the city, and your voices will be heard long after your retirement again.

170
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:47,905
May I thank you for your years of service to this city, and please continue doing the things you do.

171
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:48,245
Thank you.

172
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:49,226
Thank you.

173
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:50,526
Councilor Scott Pelley.

174
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:56,370
As a fellow Mustang Hall of Fame member, I look at my

175
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,532
fellow leader and thank you for everything you do.

176
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:26,051
I think that my council colleagues have said so much and there's not much more that I can add but just thank you and really to reach out to the rest of the community and say this is who we should emulate because Meffitt's a great city to live in and it's people like yourself who give so much and ask for so little and

177
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:34,943
I hope someone really sees that torch and runs with it, as you're such a great role model.

178
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:35,763
So thank you so much.

179
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:38,945
Thank you.

180
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:39,766
And Councilor Knight.

181
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,667
Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

182
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,168
And Mae, congratulations.

183
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,829
I could say the same thing that my councilors have all said.

184
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,330
I echo their sentiment.

185
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,973
I am wondering, however, what you get for 25 years of service.

186
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:52,653
Is it a watch?

187
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,235
Do they give you a watch from the Cheville Air Commission?

188
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:58,127
Nice, that's pretty good.

189
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,688
That's an incentive right there.

190
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,670
May, congratulations.

191
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,591
I wish you the best of luck.

192
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,913
Thank you very much for all you've done for the city and for his service.

193
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:06,254
Thank you.

194
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,555
And if I could just read this letter.

195
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:13,421
Tonight we received a letter from the Meffitt Brooks Estates Land Trust, dated May 12th, 2017.

196
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:21,368
It says, dear President Caviello, we are delighted the Meffitt City Council is honoring May Makibrick.

197
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:29,673
The Meffitt-Brooks Estates Land Trust's M-Belt is deeply appreciative of all Mae Makibrek has done on behalf of our beloved Brooks Estates.

198
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,135
She has been with us for almost two decades.

199
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:38,038
The time we have spent so far to bring back this unique community asset to full public benefit.

200
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,783
Her insights, energy, wise counsel, and steadfastness have been invaluable to us over the years.

201
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:51,427
Mae has brought a unique blend of both traditional and new Meffitt to the table, and her enthusiasm and passion

202
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,831
embody all that is good about our community.

203
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:54,912
We will miss her.

204
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:56,292
Happy birthday, May.

205
00:18:56,753 --> 00:19:03,876
We wish May all the best on her retirement from most of, and that's in parentheses, public life here in Method.

206
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:10,960
Although we are sure we'll see her around town, we intend to honor her in our own way at one of our events this summer.

207
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,602
So we hope she is ready to be embarrassed once again.

208
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:18,144
Thank you for your continued support of the Brooks Estates.

209
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:20,405
With best wishes, Tom Lincoln,

210
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:22,816
President of the Brooks Estates Land Trust.

211
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:25,477
Thank you very much.

212
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,058
Thank you again.

213
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:33,561
Mr. President.

214
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:34,082
Mr. President.

215
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:43,046
We do have one other paper up here.

216
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:45,587
That's May related.

217
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,468
May, don't go too far.

218
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,374
Okay, motions, orders, and resolutions.

219
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:56,377
Paper 17-449, offered by President Caviello.

220
00:19:56,897 --> 00:20:06,304
Be resolved, the Meffitt City Council and the City of Meffitt celebrate and wish, may mock your breath, a happy birthday.

221
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:25,718
Mr. President, I move for a brief recess.

222
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,908
Chair's got a call for a quick recess.

223
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:36,527
Motion by Councilor Knight to reconvene and go back to regular.

224
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:43,355
Motion for suspension of the rules by Councilor Longo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

225
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,397
Councilor Longo-Kern.

226
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:49,141
I take paper 17-371 off the table.

227
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:50,983
Off of unfinished business, I mean.

228
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:51,023
17-371.

229
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:23,815
17-371, change in chapter 48 ordinance on demolition delay on historic properties.

230
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,738
This paper is taking its third reading this evening.

231
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:31,941
Mr. Clerk, please.

232
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,923
Motion for approval by Councilor Langlois-Kern.

233
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,125
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

234
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,827
Councilor DelaRusso, excuse me.

235
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,329
Councilor Dela Russo.

236
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:56,215
Mr. President, I just want to point out that this has gone through extensive review and committees and was subject to considerable debate some weeks ago with significant negotiation, second approval.

237
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:57,376
Thank you.

238
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,198
Motion by Councilor Locario, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

239
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,578
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

240
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,781
Councilor Dela Russo.

241
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:10,181
Yes.

242
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:11,525
Councilor Falco?

243
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:11,926
Yes.

244
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:13,166
Councilor Knight?

245
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:13,426
Yes.

246
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:14,947
Councilor Long-Term?

247
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:15,387
Yes.

248
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:16,748
Vice President Marks?

249
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,208
Yes.

250
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:18,669
Councilor Scott Kelly?

251
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:19,169
Yes.

252
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,550
President Caviello?

253
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,930
Yes.

254
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,092
Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

255
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,313
The ordinance has passed.

256
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,114
Councilor Knight.

257
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:34,795
Mr. President, we're going to suspension.

258
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:37,338
Can we take paper 17453, a petition for common victuals license? 17453.

259
00:29:45,021 --> 00:30:03,285
17453, petition for a common fixture license by Leonardo Soros, 25 Acorn Street, Malden, Mass., for Forno, Fogo, H.O., Inc., Doing Business As, Forno, Fogo, Healthy Options, 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway in Medford.

260
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:07,806
And Councilor Scott Pelley has relinquished the chair to Councilor Knight.

261
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:08,526
Councilor Knight.

262
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:10,667
Mr. President, thank you very much.

263
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:16,919
petition for a common victuals license is actually for a juice bar inside gold's gym.

264
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,500
It's my understanding that historically gold's gym has operated juice bars in the past at other locations.

265
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,961
Um, I've reviewed the paperwork and all the paperwork appears to be in order.

266
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:31,703
Mr. President, um, this doesn't seem like anything that's too controversial in my opinion and I would move for approval on the motion by council.

267
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,024
The ninth council Scott belly.

268
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:38,065
Um, I'd have to abstain from a vote for conflict of interest.

269
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,653
Councilor Scott Pele is sustained.

270
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,934
As such, Mr. President, I move for a roll call vote.

271
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:54,436
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

272
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:57,477
Councilor DelaRusso?

273
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:58,177
Yes.

274
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,357
Councilor Falco?

275
00:30:59,718 --> 00:30:59,878
Yes.

276
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:00,738
Councilor Knight?

277
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:01,278
Yes.

278
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:01,998
Councilor McCurran?

279
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:02,138
Yes.

280
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:04,519
Vice President Marks?

281
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,039
Yes.

282
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,039
Councilor Scott Pele?

283
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,319
Present.

284
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,390
President Caviello.

285
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:16,312
Yes, six in the affirmative, one present, motion passes, congratulations.

286
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:16,773
Thank you.

287
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:20,234
We'll hopefully stop by and get some healthy juice, we could use it.

288
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:21,714
Thank you.

289
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,114
Thank you.

290
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:30,417
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

291
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:32,257
Public hearing, City of Medford, 17444.

292
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:48,839
to have a brief synopsis.

293
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,101
I'll try to be brief.

294
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,122
It's a challenge, but I'll try to be brief.

295
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:56,302
Thank you very much.

296
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,163
Tonight's actually an interesting night.

297
00:31:58,203 --> 00:32:04,845
It's the 43rd program year of the Community Development Block Grant, and I'm actually before you with an estimated allocation.

298
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,786
We are estimating that we will receive the money

299
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:14,813
that we have received last year, but this year, for the first time, after 43 years of the CDBG program, we don't have our allocation from the federal government.

300
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:18,195
As you all know, the debates that have been going on in it, which I won't go into detail.

301
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:34,802
So we've been instructed by the area HUD office to prepare our budgets and move ahead, and then have a phrase in our application, which we have in the notice that we gave to the city clerk, that basically says we will proportionately increase or decrease this budget based on what the actual allocation amounts are.

302
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:39,285
We expect that we should get them by the end of June, and then they'll move very quickly.

303
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:43,708
They have to be submitted to HUD so that they can meet their statutory requirements for review.

304
00:32:53,113 --> 00:33:03,462
housing activities, physical improvements to public systems and city systems, economic development, public services, planning and administration, and program income.

305
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:07,246
And those budgets will also include public services.

306
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:12,030
We have funded here in this program about 14 public service agencies for a total of $210,586.

307
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:18,055
And if they're listening tonight, they should remember that caveat I just said.

308
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:20,257
It's contingent on receipt of the federal funds.

309
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,541
from the Community Development Block Grant Program.

310
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:32,808
Everybody's support to their Congress people and to the President about continuing this program is appreciated, and we've appreciated all of the support of the City Council to accomplish many great activities.

311
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:38,032
If you'd like, I can respond to specific questions if you would like to keep this portion of the hearing short.

312
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:39,483
Councilor Del Rosso.

313
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:53,007
Mr. President, year after year, we have meetings with representatives and delegations from various public service organizations and non-profits who do business in our city and who benefit from these grants.

314
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:58,848
The Office of Community Development goes to great lengths to accommodate and to disperse these funds.

315
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:07,426
kind manner, and a great sense of concern is put into this.

316
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:19,028
So in that light, and I must lament the possibility of diminishment of these fundings, but I move approval to the plan that's been presented to us.

317
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:19,928
Thank you.

318
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:21,669
Councilor Nyth.

319
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,229
Mr. President, I too support the plan that's been presented to us.

320
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:29,390
The Office of Community Development has done an excellent job since my election to the council in explaining where these funds go.

321
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:37,846
All the applicants come before the council at a committee of the whole meeting and pitch their case to request this funding as to why it would be good for the city of Medford.

322
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:42,554
Provided that there's nobody here in opposition, Mr. President, I move that we close the public hearing.

323
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,501
Councilor Marks, Vice President Marks.

324
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,261
Thank you, Mr. President.

325
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:53,884
Lauren, are the human service groups made aware of what is happening?

326
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:54,664
Yes.

327
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:55,524
Do we send a letter?

328
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,785
How are they made aware?

329
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,726
We've actually had a meeting with them before.

330
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:05,088
We met with a committee, the whole of the city council had a meeting that we do with the senior center every year.

331
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:05,889
They're all invited.

332
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,470
They're told in that meeting notice, most of them come.

333
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,790
They're really supposed to all come.

334
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,871
A couple don't come, but they've all been told.

335
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,382
about what the status of it is.

336
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:17,644
And a lot of them actually have this similar problem where there are other funding sources.

337
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:18,705
So, yes, they all know that.

338
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:24,868
When we will be waiting for the allocation, we won't make any announcements and there won't be any contracts executed.

339
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:27,730
We can't do that until HUD actually gives us the allocation.

340
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,691
We submit our plan.

341
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:29,731
It's approved.

342
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:38,637
And, you know, it's probably likely that money, if they move things along the way they're talking, would probably be available, I'm going to guess, sometime in August or late September.

343
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:46,675
They'll know we keep them informed and I think they all pretty much know they're suffering the similar problems with other funding sources as I said.

344
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:57,362
So has any group mentioned that because of maybe staff hiring or other employee issues that there may be a concern if they don't get the funding from day one?

345
00:35:58,163 --> 00:35:59,784
They have not raised those issues to us.

346
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:00,925
There's been no issues.

347
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:01,946
Thank you.

348
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,407
Councilor Lungo-Kernan.

349
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:06,088
Thank you, President Carviello.

350
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:07,870
Thank you for coming.

351
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:13,372
with regards to the allocation portion of it, nobody's going to be cut out?

352
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:15,615
Is it just going to be if we receive 10% less?

353
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,078
Everybody, how would it be broken down?

354
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:25,426
So the maximum we can fund is 15% of the total allocation, and the table you see there, and I want to clarify a couple things for you on that.

355
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,723
The table you see there allocating $210,000 is if we get level funded.

356
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:39,011
So the way I'm proposing is that we would increase these agencies up to a maximum of 15% if the allocation increases and decrease them proportionally if the allocation is cut.

357
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,032
There are two things, two changes.

358
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:43,835
The Medford Housing Authority did not receive money last year.

359
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:49,840
They applied for money, about $8,000 to hire or actually pay a stipend to someone to provide

360
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:55,368
language translation services at the walking court development for people who are Haitian.

361
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,111
And honestly, in order for us to fund it, number one, we don't know if we're going to get the money.

362
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,332
Number two, we'd have to cut our other agency by that.

363
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:07,154
So to give them a token amount we didn't think would really be beneficial, and we'd have to cut another agency.

364
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:10,576
And a couple of these agencies are receiving under a couple of thousand dollars.

365
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,217
Salvation Army is an agency that did apply.

366
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:17,339
Last year, Salvation Army was the agency with all the resources that they have.

367
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:22,565
You know, under a couple of thousand dollars that they get from us, they returned back money last year.

368
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:32,773
They have very stringent, how do I want to say, intentions about the person that we deal with, intentions about how they want to distribute the money.

369
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:35,135
And so again, we've already heard that they may not spend the money.

370
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:37,177
And this is very emergency assistance money.

371
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:42,642
So we made a recommendation to the mayor, which she agreed was to allocate that to another agency.

372
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:45,124
And you will see that we have,

373
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:58,846
suggested that the community family which provides Alzheimer assistance and subsidizes the tuition or the fees for a Medford resident or more than one resident, if there's money available, they receive $1,745.

374
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,907
We've recommended they go up to $2,907.

375
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:12,532
And then we'll, you know, as we can, if we can, poke down to get some of these other agencies that are under a couple thousand dollars up in the future that we hope to try to do that.

376
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:13,472
So that's what we did.

377
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:15,673
So, yes, Medford Housing Authority,

378
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:18,830
which never has not received money into public services.

379
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:25,911
And then salvation army was eliminated on the fact that they did not spend their money last year and are not on target to spend it again this year.

380
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:27,191
Gotcha.

381
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:29,372
So that explains why the two aren't in here.

382
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:39,614
And then if we did get 15% more, these one to 10, 15, um, agencies will get 15% more across the board.

383
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:40,254
If it was 15, it would be 15.

384
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,155
If it was 10, 10% cut, they'd be 10% cut.

385
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,861
what I'm getting at is none will get changed drastically depending.

386
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:47,642
It depends.

387
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:52,444
It depends on, we could get no funding and then they will get nothing and we will get nothing.

388
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,965
So, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trust.

389
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:59,627
Well, we have to trust still in the system of government that we have and that that won't happen.

390
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,668
Um, so yes.

391
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:08,091
So that's why we do support everybody, uh, basically letting know their elected officials know the importance of this program and advocating for it.

392
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:09,372
Thank you.

393
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:12,013
And then my last question would just be just to give us a,

394
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:13,425
a brief summary.

395
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:20,088
I mean, people at home should know a little bit of where this money's going, how much we have as a total, and where it goes.

396
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,909
So if you could give us a brief summary, that would be helpful.

397
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:27,631
So the total amount of money that we're estimating, again, it's an estimate, is $1,403,210.

398
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:30,692
We're allocating, we're proposing $20,000 for housing.

399
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:35,034
We have some existing housing money, so that's not all the money that we have for housing resources.

400
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:42,357
We're also eligible to access money with non-profit agencies through the city's relationship with the North Suburban Consortium.

401
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:43,933
Economic development, $20,000.

402
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:48,715
As you see, we talked about the storefront program and economic development strategy.

403
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:50,216
We still have some money from this year.

404
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:52,116
We have not implemented that storefront program.

405
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:56,818
So we have money from this year, and we have money going forward if this is funded.

406
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:01,600
Public services, you cannot carry money over from one year to the next on public services.

407
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,302
So that $210,000 would be the max, and that's contingent on that allocation number that I told you.

408
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:17,191
And those go to a variety of agencies, people working with after-school programs to English language classes.

409
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:23,553
The senior center here in Medford receives a good portion of the money.

410
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:26,813
SCM Community Transportation is an agency that also is well-funded.

411
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:31,375
We have an agency that provides housing counseling services.

412
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:35,676
Actually, I shouldn't use housing counseling services anymore because HUD has now defined that strictly.

413
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:43,132
housing referral agencies and advocacy and protection for people who are going through evictions and things like that, representation in court.

414
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:50,883
So, and we also have funding that goes to EMARC and I think the, not I think, no.

415
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:52,518
the Boys and Girls Club.

416
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:54,119
So those are generally the kind of services.

417
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,142
They're a wide range of very important services that assist Medford's low and moderate income populations.

418
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:04,485
And planning and admin goes for any kind of study that's related to the CDBG program.

419
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,346
It might be fair housing if that's what happens.

420
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:10,348
We help pay toward the city's single audit for the portion of our program.

421
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:16,052
It also funds the majority of the staff costs in our office and a portion of the diversity director's office.

422
00:41:23,054 --> 00:41:23,395
Thank you.

423
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:25,396
Councilor Knight.

424
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:31,100
It's also my understanding, Mr. Lorenzo, that a draft of the plan can be obtained in the Office of Community Development on April 20th.

425
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:34,143
It's currently available in our office.

426
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:39,126
There is also a draft version of that plan that's on the website.

427
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,888
We're accepting comments until the 20th.

428
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:46,652
So if there are public comments written or verbally, we will consider those in the final plan that we produce.

429
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:50,475
And as I said, we can't submit that final plan now until HUD gives us the allocation.

430
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:56,239
Uh, if anybody has a comment that they would like to make, they're welcome to submit it to us and it will be formally included in the plan.

431
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,661
We receive it by the 20th.

432
00:41:59,682 --> 00:41:59,983
Thank you.

433
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:04,527
This is a public hearing and uh, Lauren DiLorenzo is in favor.

434
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:09,271
Do we have anyone else here to speak in favor of this hearing?

435
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:12,013
Hearing and seeing none.

436
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:14,075
This part of the hearing is closed.

437
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:18,859
Do we have anyone in opposition to this hearing?

438
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:24,110
Hearing and seeing none, that part of the hearing is closed.

439
00:42:25,351 --> 00:42:28,514
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Nights.

440
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:31,156
Councilor Nights.

441
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:33,057
I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President.

442
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:43,526
I'd like to amend the paper with a B paper requesting that our federal delegation be written and asked to prioritize level funding of the Community Development Block Grant, Mr. President.

443
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:52,585
Um, I'd also like to request that our state delegation send letters of support to a federal delegation requesting that they do their best to ensure level funding of our community development block grant.

444
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:56,409
I'd ask my colleagues to support the amendment.

445
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:56,989
Thank you.

446
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:04,155
On the motion by color councilor Dela Rousseau, seconded by councilor Knight as amended by councilor Knight.

447
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:05,837
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

448
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:17,082

Yes.

450
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:19,243
Councilor Scarpelli?

451
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:19,644
Yes.

452
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,004
President Caviello?

453
00:43:21,304 --> 00:43:21,564
Yes.

454
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,666
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

455
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:26,307
Motion passes.

456
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:26,827
Thank you very much.

457
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,168
I want to thank you again for your support.

458
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:28,928
Thank you very much.

459
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:32,109
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

460
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,410
Okay.

461
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:36,932
What do you want us to spend?

462
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:37,492
17, four, five, zero.

463
00:43:37,512 --> 00:43:37,492
17.

464
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:37,632
17, four.

465
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:47,207
petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

466
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:52,150
Petition for signed denial reversal by Rafael Batista.

467
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:59,274
Raffle graphic for Global Healthcare Enterprises, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass.

468
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:02,076
OCD application 2017B94306 exceeds allowable amounts.

469
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:05,078
Name and address for the record, please.

470
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:14,406
My name is Rafael Batista.

471
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:16,547
The address is five high street in Medford.

472
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:23,250
The business is global health care.

473
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,111
Yes, please.

474
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:29,894
Uh, uh, state, uh, your reasons for, uh, in the scope that you're asking for reversal of the sign denial.

475
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:36,597
Uh, the reason, the first reason is going to be that we request to be two signs

476
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:55,028
because of the large size of the building and directions of the street that whoever's coming into one side of the building, we're not going to be able to see the other side of the building, which the client has the top, the whole top corner of the entire building as his business.

477
00:44:55,908 --> 00:45:01,149
And we require to be, we're being required by the inspector to be more darker.

478
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:03,950
So we put the box itself to be brown.

479
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,270
So we match with the building.

480
00:45:05,879 --> 00:45:11,182
and the colors to be plain with the colors of our nation, which is red, white, and blue.

481
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,323
And plain and simple.

482
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:21,846
And we also had an issue that we unfortunately made a mistake putting the lettering on the windows that without the permit.

483
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:24,108
And then we've been fined.

484
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,328
We paid the fine.

485
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:33,332
And now the client agreed to remove the logos from the windows because we are going to be putting the signs up in approval.

486
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:45,979
But he also wanted to request, if it's possible, there is a possibility to keep the lettering over the surface that he presents on the glasses, which is already on the copy that you guys probably have it.

487
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,480
Thank you.

488
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,722
Chair recognizes President Carafiello.

489
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:51,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

490
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:58,207
Mr. Chairman, I am objecting to the, is this illuminated sign?

491
00:45:58,607 --> 00:45:59,067
Yes, it is.

492
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:03,050
First of all, I'm objecting to the sign being illuminated in the middle of the square.

493
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:08,109
And I'm objecting to, it doesn't fit, I don't think, with the rest of the signs in the square.

494
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:15,553
I know it's oversized, but if you could letter it on the building, I think it would look a lot better than an illuminated sign.

495
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:18,855
I mean, this is a sign that you see in a strip mall, not in the middle of Meffitt Square.

496
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:23,497
And here we are, we're trying to revive Meffitt Square and make it look a little more pleasurable.

497
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:29,300
I don't feel that that type of sign represents what I'd like to see in Meffitt Square or many of the other people.

498
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:41,274
That would be my request, if you could letter the building similar to like, if you see in your pictures here, similar to like the other buildings have.

499
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,177
That's my request, and not have it illuminated.

500
00:46:44,197 --> 00:46:47,380
That would be my request to you.

501
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:51,163
Thank you.

502
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:53,086
Thank you, Mr. President.

503
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:54,708
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

504
00:46:55,368 --> 00:46:56,649
Mr. President, thank you very much.

505
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,635
As we go through our packet this evening, we'll see that there are two requests for sign reversals related to 5 High Street.

506
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:12,825
And I think if both petitions before the council this evening were approved, it would be ugly is the best word that I can come up with, Mr. President.

507
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:15,268
I don't think it really fits in with the character of the neighborhood based upon

508
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:22,198
Um, the total number of signs that are being presented tonight and the location thereof, uh, all in the same building.

509
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:30,302
Um, I certainly can agree with counselor Cabello's position that, uh, an illuminated sign wouldn't fit in with the quality, um, in criteria that's down in that area.

510
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:37,445
Um, personally, Mr. President, I think the best course of action would be to have this matter referred to our subcommittee on signs, uh, for further review and discussion.

511
00:47:37,465 --> 00:47:40,607
Uh, I don't think that this is something that, um, when,

512
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:47,172
partnered with the other matter that's before us is going to be beneficial to the revitalization of our downtown of Memphis square.

513
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:49,553
I think it's going to, uh, be an eyesore more or less.

514
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:50,293
Right.

515
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:59,936
So on the motion of council night to refer this matter, uh, to the, uh, sign committee seconded by president Caviello chair recognizes councilor marks.

516
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:01,916
Thank you.

517
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:02,877
Thank you, Mr. President.

518
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:06,618
Um, I think what we're seeing here tonight is, um,

519
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:10,598
based on the location of the building.

520
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:21,540
So if you look at the picture that we have on the paper we received, the building is located partially on Forest Street and partially on High Street.

521
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,822
So for all intents and purposes, it's like this building has two fronting facades.

522
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:31,303
And I think that's what at least this petition is trying to accomplish.

523
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:36,744
I don't agree with the illuminated signs, and I think this council has been on record,

524
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,781
not supporting illuminated signs.

525
00:48:38,802 --> 00:48:56,597
Uh, however, the, uh, the type of sign and the number of signs I have no problem with, uh, based on what I believe, uh, is the hardship of having your main entrance on high street and, uh, the rest of your building, uh, on forestry.

526
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:00,540
And that to me proposes a hardship.

527
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:02,442
And I think the additional signage

528
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:04,899
is warranted in this particular case.

529
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:07,420
So I don't agree with my other colleagues.

530
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:14,564
Uh, the only thing I do agree with is the fact that, uh, I don't support the internally illuminated, uh, portion of it.

531
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:20,667
Uh, if it's, if it's the druthers of the council to send this to the sign committee, I have no problem with that.

532
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:26,650
I'm not quite sure what we're going to accomplish there that we couldn't accomplish right now with the party before us.

533
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:35,272
If there's recommendations, you know, if the party agrees upon them now, I don't see why we have to have a subcommittee meeting on this issue.

534
00:49:36,592 --> 00:49:38,472
Those are my thoughts, Mr. President.

535
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:39,392
Thank you very much.

536
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:54,115
And as chairman of the Business and Economic Development and Science Committee, also with myself and Councilor Scott Pelley, we'll, once we finish with debate on this matter, we'll take the vote on the motion.

537
00:49:54,896 --> 00:49:56,796
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

538
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:19,004
If I can, I know with the denial of the signs, I think that if you look at the rest of the square, and keeping with the theme that we have right now, if you look across the street, I don't disagree with Council Marks and the petitioner looking for the number of signs, but if you look at the way that Andre Realty

539
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:21,618
did what they did across the street.

540
00:50:21,658 --> 00:50:28,544
They have multiple signs, but the way they addressed it, it fits the look of the square where it's not illuminated.

541
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:42,656
And they added decorative lights around it that shows that would like the sign, but at the same time keeps the same appeal and routine throughout our

542
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,814
our business community in Meffitt Square.

543
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:52,817
So I'm not a fan of the lit sign.

544
00:50:53,958 --> 00:51:00,621
If you look across the other businesses in the square, I think you could see that it's tasteful.

545
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:11,543
And with the different forms of lighting, I think you can accommodate what you're looking for to illuminate your sign with what the neighboring businesses have.

546
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:14,885
So I too will not support the illuminated sign.

547
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:24,413
I will entertain a few different signs locations because it does wrap around so I can understand that need.

548
00:51:24,593 --> 00:51:30,278
But again, I will not support the big illuminated signs.

549
00:51:31,197 --> 00:51:31,937
Thank you, Counselor.

550
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:34,178
Chair recognizes Counselor Lungo-Curran.

551
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,980
Thank you, President, Counselor De La Ruzo, sorry.

552
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:42,482
With regards to the science, were awnings discussed at all?

553
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:45,404
No.

554
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:51,166
We thought about it, but we thought that would be more complicated to get approval on that.

555
00:51:52,307 --> 00:52:00,531
Yeah, I mean, Nick, I am trying to hear out what my council colleagues are saying, and you did attach, oh, actually, Wayside, which is the next petitioner, did attach

556
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,902
signs from across the street, which are much more expensive signs and obviously very nice character for the neighborhood.

557
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,683
But I understand that not everybody can afford that.

558
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:17,005
And at the same token, where these two businesses are, you do have awnings at the restaurant.

559
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:18,965
So maybe even that would help.

560
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:23,546
Something like that would be a little in-between resolution.

561
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:26,607
And I'm not sure if it will help all my colleagues.

562
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,048
But I just was curious if that was discussed at all.

563
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,745
That is a tough location to have a business.

564
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:32,765
The parking is tough.

565
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:39,288
So I do see the need for a sign on each street, forest, and high.

566
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:40,348
So I agree with that.

567
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:42,669
So I think we're almost along the same lines.

568
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:54,173
But whether or not you want to take it back and do a redesign to appease all the counselors or get two signs with no illumination, I think it's kind of up to you.

569
00:52:56,125 --> 00:53:05,609
because I do like what's across the street better, but at the same token, I understand that's probably much more pricey and there are awnings and different wall stickers on the building you're on.

570
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:10,892
So I mean, business has to do what they can afford, although it would be nice to have some conformity.

571
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:16,014
Thank you, Madam Councilor.

572
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:17,955
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

573
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:19,156
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

574
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:25,719
I'm reviewing the documents here and I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated sign,

575
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:36,992
And when I look at the signs in the square, the other thing that I like, and we're trying to, I think in many ways, the community is trying to rebrand Medford Square because we're trying to bring business in.

576
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:42,856
And when I look at these signs in other businesses, everything seems to be very uniform.

577
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:44,197
It's all on the same level.

578
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:51,662
If I take a look at the sign, your sign, and then I take a look at Wayside, you know, Wayside

579
00:53:52,244 --> 00:54:00,548
seems to be in line with the rest of the businesses and you're popping up in the air a bit, you know, which seems kind of, just seems out of whack kind of.

580
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:04,130
I mean, it seems like, you know, it doesn't seem that clean.

581
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,871
It just seems like it would be nice if you could kind of get everything in one uniform way.

582
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:12,774
But I will admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated signs.

583
00:54:13,094 --> 00:54:14,334
Is there any flexibility on that?

584
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,455
I believe so.

585
00:54:16,896 --> 00:54:18,496
I actually have a question right now.

586
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:26,218
What about, I'm just counting here, it looks like we have six sets of windows up in his office.

587
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:32,300
Would it be allowed, you guys, would it allow if we present to the client to be awnings instead?

588
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:40,641
You want to, I'm sorry, you want to put awnings in the place of the sign?

589
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:43,322
Awnings on top of each window.

590
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,083
On top of the windows at the very top?

591
00:54:46,243 --> 00:54:47,103
At the very top, yes.

592
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:53,871
Perhaps we could do like red and then with the white, just white letters, global healthcare.

593
00:54:54,551 --> 00:55:02,335
I'm wondering if that needs to be discussed with your client and perhaps the property owner.

594
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,857
To the point of information, Councillor Knight.

595
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:15,727
when I raised the issue of referring it to the subcommittee, my intention was to do so so that we could get both petitioners wayside and global health services together in the same room and they could make a joint presentation to the council.

596
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:21,952
It looks like it would be something that would fit more within the quality and character of the neighborhood was the way that I was thinking that it was going to work.

597
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,493
That's how I took your motion to be attended.

598
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:29,317
Councilor Falco, you still have floor.

599
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:30,177
I'm all set.

600
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:30,518
Thank you.

601
00:55:30,638 --> 00:55:30,958
Thank you.

602
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:36,447
So on the motion of Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Carviello, President Carviello.

603
00:55:36,788 --> 00:55:37,628
All those in favor.

604
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:39,709
Councilor Marks.

605
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,331
Please record me in opposition to this, Mr. President.

606
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:45,852
I do not support the illuminated.

607
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:54,936
sign, but I do support moving forward with the signage on both Forest and High Street because of the hardship the petitioner has.

608
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:55,737
Very good.

609
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:01,339
On that motion and recognizing Councilor Mark's opposition, all those in favor?

610
00:56:01,919 --> 00:56:02,699
All those opposed?

611
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,361
The ayes have it.

612
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:08,041
Councilor Knight.

613
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:08,041
17451.

614
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:12,323
Similar matter.

615
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,084
It's going to sound like the same exact conversation I think we just had.

616
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:15,744
Very good.

617
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:21,608
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take 17451 out of order.

618
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:22,668
All those in favor?

619
00:56:22,748 --> 00:56:23,448
All those opposed?

620
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:32,173
17451, petition for sign denial reversal by Richard DiTullio, property manager for Wayside Youth and Family, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass.

621
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:41,497
OCD application 2017-11A exceeds allowable size, secondary sign, and window signage.

622
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,761
Is the petitioner present?

623
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:45,741
If you are, please present yourself to the podium.

624
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,522
State your name and address for the record.

625
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:50,863
Good evening.

626
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:54,183
My name's Richard DiTullio, property manager with Wayside Youth.

627
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:59,705
I'm here with the owner of the sign company, Rachel O'Donoghue.

628
00:56:59,945 --> 00:57:00,405
How do you do?

629
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:08,468
First, I just want to be clear that this gentleman's property is on the second floor.

630
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:09,748
We're aware of that.

631
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,771
Okay, so is he looking to put a sign adjacent to ours on the ground floor?

632
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:15,511
Yes.

633
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:19,712
Isn't this space for the first floor tenant?

634
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:22,452
That's up to the landlord, yes.

635
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,975
No wonder they said no, because we're asking to put the sign in that panel.

636
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:44,317
Yeah, I can see we have a kind of a collision there of signs.

637
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:56,685
It would seem, and I think the sentiments of the council with us, with the approval of that previous motion, that the wise thing to do would be to meet in committee to where

638
00:57:58,426 --> 00:58:22,235
The proceedings can be a little more conversational, that charts and designs can be exchanged, an assessment of what the ordinances are can also be substantiated by the OCD director or the building inspector, and I think we can come to some conclusions in that forum.

639
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:28,708
But you have the floor, so if you would present your matter to us.

640
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:38,210
Well, what we had hoped to do was on the ground floor, we had planned on putting two signs above the windows.

641
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:42,872
One of the signs has been approved by the building department.

642
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,333
That sign is in production.

643
00:58:45,413 --> 00:58:47,974
It's a non-illuminated sign.

644
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:54,816
It's a white background, green lettering, with our company logo, if you will.

645
00:58:55,777 --> 00:59:03,940
What we had wanted to do in our application was add a second sign, again, because of the wrap onto Forest Street.

646
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,342
In addition to that, we wanted to put three signs in the window itself.

647
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:17,268
The addition of the sign that the tenant up on the second floor has is a surprise.

648
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:21,372
And again, we can understand why it looks very busy with signs.

649
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:27,504
So we're, you know, we're, we're a, uh, not for profit.

650
00:59:27,524 --> 00:59:28,864
We've been around for a long time.

651
00:59:28,924 --> 00:59:32,205
We hope to, uh, do well in the Medford area.

652
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:42,988
Um, and, uh, and, and the council understands for both entities, the importance of, uh, having signs, uh, on a place of, uh, business.

653
00:59:43,608 --> 00:59:48,269
Uh, so, uh, we're aware of that and, uh, hope to expedite this.

654
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:51,050
Uh, but, uh, the chair awaits motion.

655
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:57,158
committee on science, business and economic development on that motion.

656
00:59:57,178 --> 00:59:59,919
A chair recognizes a president.

657
00:59:59,939 --> 01:00:00,400
Carve yellow.

658
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:00,740
Second.

659
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,140
Yes.

660
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:01,880
Thank you.

661
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,441
Chair recognizes council marks.

662
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:20,007
Mr. President record me in opposition based on the fact that, um, this business as well as the prior business owner has the same hardship being located at a very busy intersection on two major roads in the square and the additional signage, in my opinion,

663
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:21,771
is warranted, Mr. President.

664
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:34,403
And, you know, after discussing for many years how dark Meffitt Square is, maybe we should start looking at internally illuminated signs to help out with the brightness in the square, Mr. President.

665
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:39,547
And, you know, maybe that's something that's needed in this community, Mr. President.

666
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:42,630
So record me in opposition based on those facts.

667
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:43,831
The President Very good.

668
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:51,473
Perhaps I might say from the chair that externally illuminated signs might achieve the same.

669
01:00:51,874 --> 01:00:58,739
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello, understanding that Councilor Marks wishes to be marked in opposition.

670
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,363
Chair recognizes Vice President, uh, uh, Councilor.

671
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:08,806
I also want to be recorded in opposition with regards to the two signs for the, um,

672
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:09,980
front of the building.

673
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,025
I think that's like I said in the last petition, I think that's necessary for this location.

674
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:18,688
So I just want to be recorded in opposition for those two signs.

675
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:19,609
Very good.

676
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,394
On the motion, uh, councilor Scott Pelly, right?

677
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:25,475
I think the, the,

678
01:01:26,448 --> 01:01:30,772
The biggest confusion right now is the muddy water now with the other issue.

679
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:36,436
So I don't, if you came to us with this being the only issue with two signs, I would support it.

680
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:47,665
But with the other signs, one going above it, now in my mind to prove that and then possibly have that as an option later, I can't support it.

681
01:01:47,725 --> 01:01:52,730
So I would go with the subcommittee so we can talk this out and listen to the

682
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:58,325
you know, what the landlord has to say and then, you know, and find some other solutions.

683
01:01:58,365 --> 01:02:01,727
But when the time comes, I definitely support the two sides.

684
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:03,027
I think that's going to be needed.

685
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:08,750
Typically, though, wouldn't the second floor tenant be limited to his window space?

686
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,911
Again, we don't know for the fact that it's a landlord issue.

687
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:12,611
That's not with us.

688
01:02:15,073 --> 01:02:19,395
I mean, you're probably paying the prime rate because you're on the first floor.

689
01:02:21,903 --> 01:02:25,706
Obviously, there's a solution here, and the Councillors want to get to it.

690
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,567
All set, Councillor?

691
01:02:27,587 --> 01:02:27,947
Thank you.

692
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:29,308
Chair recognizes Councillor Falco.

693
01:02:29,348 --> 01:02:30,449
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

694
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:33,010
I agree with my colleague, Councillor Scarpelli.

695
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:35,172
I actually have no problem with the signs.

696
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:37,433
I actually like the signs, and I think they're fine.

697
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:39,214
There is some confusion, though.

698
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:42,677
If you look at these two pictures, all these signs are in the same spot.

699
01:02:42,877 --> 01:02:49,201
I wasn't aware of that, because they're renting the first floor, so I assumed that the façade belonged to the first floor.

700
01:02:50,954 --> 01:02:54,376
I didn't even know there was somebody else moving in there that they were looking for signs.

701
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:57,059
But like I said, I have no problem with the signs.

702
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,340
I think the signs look fine.

703
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,801
They're very professional.

704
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:01,002
They're not illuminated.

705
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:02,763
They're nice.

706
01:03:03,264 --> 01:03:11,571
I just think going to subcommittee, I think we'll hopefully resolve some issues, clear things up, and then come before us again.

707
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:21,827
Mr. Chair, we request a meeting relatively quick because I know the hardship here, so it wouldn't be something waiting weeks.

708
01:03:21,847 --> 01:03:24,848
I'd like to get this done as soon as possible if we can.

709
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:27,829
Councilor Knight, move the question.

710
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:32,290
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by President Carviello.

711
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,630
All those in favor?

712
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,131
Aye.

713
01:03:34,451 --> 01:03:35,291
All those opposed?

714
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:42,133
The ayes have it, with Councilors Lungelkern and Marks in opposition.

715
01:03:43,811 --> 01:03:47,415
Councilor, President Carfiello.

716
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:48,336
Thank you, Mr. President.

717
01:03:48,537 --> 01:04:03,735
Mr. President, before we go on to the next thing, seeing that the gentleman before this had to pay a fine for a sign violation, I would hope that the code enforcement officer goes out into the square there, because I think there are many other

718
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:06,249
sign violations in the square that he could take care of.

719
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:11,333
And that gentleman shouldn't have been singled out, uh, previously when they say there are other violations.

720
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:17,097
And I would hope the code enforcement officer would get out there and take care of the other violations that are in the other windows in the square.

721
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:18,377
Thank you.

722
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:26,523
Uh, the, uh, council goes in record as a recommending with this motion, uh, that the, uh, code enforcement officer,

723
01:04:27,478 --> 01:04:31,281
uh, be alerted to other violations for signage in the square.

724
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:32,222
Thank you.

725
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:40,529
Uh, there will be a public notice of the meeting of the subcommittee, uh, posted on the city's website, uh, or through the clerk's office.

726
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:52,939
If you wish for them to be, um, uh, contact you, uh, to, to bring you in, uh, for that subcommittee meeting, uh, as soon as the chairman arranges for the meeting.

727
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,180
Okay.

728
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:54,821
All right.

729
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:57,006
Okay, so we can check that.

730
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:57,987
Yes.

731
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:58,327
Thank you.

732
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:58,928
Yes.

733
01:04:59,028 --> 01:04:59,508
I appreciate it.

734
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,090
Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

735
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:03,832
Thank you, Mr. President.

736
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:05,733
Madam, we have one more sign.

737
01:05:05,753 --> 01:05:12,959
Do you want to finish that last sign?

738
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:13,720
Okay.

739
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:22,487
17452, petition for sign denial reversal by Pastor Exenia Feverer for Evangelical Haitian Church of Somerville, 400 High Street, Medford.

740
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:23,588
OCD number 2017.

741
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:28,739
13, size exceeds maximum size.

742
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,260
Name and address of the record, sir.

743
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,463
Name and address of the record.

744
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:35,423
Good evening.

745
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:41,027
Thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to address the council.

746
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:49,953
And I'm Pastor Febre, and I have with me my assistant, Flo, and she... Okay.

747
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:52,234
It's 400 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 155.

748
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:56,985
Thank you.

749
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:04,711
The sign that you have there is, looks like it's bigger than the allowable amount allowed by the city.

750
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:06,812
If you see the picture here.

751
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:09,494
Yes.

752
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:14,798
And I think there's a sign there on the property now, which is, I think that's the allowable size.

753
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:17,019
Councilor Del Rosso.

754
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,902
Mr. President, I have no objection to this request to move approval.

755
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:36,518
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

756
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:50,825
If I can, I just, with the recent concerns that we've had in that area with traffic issues, I think, would this sign be too big for,

757
01:06:52,328 --> 01:07:15,743
and for public safety in the sense that for the traffic and deterring of drivers, I think that that's one of the most dangerous areas we've heard in a long time on this council with that corner and being such a encompassing sign.

758
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:18,045
I question whether that might be

759
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:23,300
a little too large and a little deterrent for the traffic.

760
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:46,468
I know we want to bring light to your church and I applaud it, but at the same time, I think public safety has to be addressed in the sense that it's really, it's, you know, I don't know if you've been familiar with that area, with the Brooks School, with the traffic, with the speed of 30 miles an hour, people being, you know,

761
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:49,700
deterred to look at such a daunting sign.

762
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:51,642
I don't know if I can support that.

763
01:07:52,903 --> 01:08:02,511
And that's what we were thinking about, is having people actually reading the sign as they were driving, because we figured if the sign

764
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:06,268
is too small, they won't be able to read it at all.

765
01:08:06,328 --> 01:08:10,549
Because the current sign that we have right now is a six by seven sign.

766
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:17,150
And for the past couple of years, we actually have had a summer festival.

767
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:21,511
And people can't even read the sign that we had right there.

768
01:08:21,551 --> 01:08:24,832
The day of the festival, people will stop by because they see activity.

769
01:08:25,532 --> 01:08:30,533
And they come in, they're like, oh, I didn't even see the sign that you have right now, because it's too far back from the church.

770
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:34,376
And the current sign that we have right now will be in the same position.

771
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:42,464
So we figured people will still kind of, maybe because it's back there with the light, they will probably see it back there.

772
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:46,848
And we have a big tree, like a huge tree, two big trees.

773
01:08:46,908 --> 01:08:49,451
I don't know if you guys have ever seen that property.

774
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,653
Huge tree in the summer, in the fall.

775
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,256
You can even see the current sign that we have back there.

776
01:08:55,696 --> 01:09:00,160
We figured maybe with a little light, they may even see a little bit of the sign.

777
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:12,530
That's why we requested that size, a five by eight or four by eight, maybe, will be like a, it's even a smaller size than the one that we have right now.

778
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,413
We figured maybe with a little light, it might be a little bit better.

779
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:20,093
Now, if I recall, you also hang banners off that sign.

780
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:22,674
Yeah, and they can't see it.

781
01:09:23,414 --> 01:09:23,654
Right.

782
01:09:23,674 --> 01:09:26,055
Well, this is pretty big.

783
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:32,817
You're talking over 11 feet high from ground to the top.

784
01:09:33,157 --> 01:09:35,358
Were there any other sizes discussed?

785
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:38,078
Yeah, the 4x8.

786
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:42,600
The current sign that you guys denied, that's a 5x8.

787
01:09:45,007 --> 01:09:47,269
The CD, I'm sorry, I apologize.

788
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,130
The CD had denied was the five by eight.

789
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:53,693
And on the appeal letter, I have mentioned the four by eight.

790
01:09:54,653 --> 01:10:02,738
It's actually was cheaper for us anyway, because yeah, it was the four by eight was a cheaper price for the pastor.

791
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:10,643
So we had asked the sign company if it would do that for us.

792
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:11,463
He says yes.

793
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:21,364
Thank you.

794
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,166
Vice President Marx.

795
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:26,227
Thank you, Mr. President.

796
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:35,014
The current sign is from the ground up five by eight, correct?

797
01:10:35,174 --> 01:10:35,374
Yes.

798
01:10:35,895 --> 01:10:37,856
The current sign is six by seven.

799
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:38,657
Six by seven.

800
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:40,078
Okay.

801
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:43,561
You've mentioned five different sizes so far, just so you know.

802
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:46,263
The current size is six by seven.

803
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:47,224
Six by seven.

804
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:47,304
Yes.

805
01:10:49,463 --> 01:10:51,984
we call the original that the church used to use.

806
01:10:52,244 --> 01:10:53,705
The one that's currently on the lawn now?

807
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:54,045
Yes.

808
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:55,386
It's six by seven?

809
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:56,266
Six by seven.

810
01:10:57,606 --> 01:11:02,228
And it's not elevated on a platform, it's on the ground, six by seven?

811
01:11:02,288 --> 01:11:02,489
Yes.

812
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:03,309
Right.

813
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:12,113
So is there any way that we can bring this sign, because if you look at your top signage, it's very close to conforming.

814
01:11:13,553 --> 01:11:14,914
When you add in the pedestal,

815
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:19,507
That's what blows this sign way out of proportion, in my opinion.

816
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:26,370
Is there any way we can bring that down a little further and shrink the signage similar to what is out there?

817
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:27,410
Sure.

818
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,411
I have no problem making it a little larger.

819
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:31,652
I like the colors of the sign.

820
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:33,553
I think it's a very nice sign.

821
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:34,974
I think it's a nice looking sign.

822
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:38,335
And I think it matches the area of what you're doing there.

823
01:11:39,156 --> 01:11:41,597
But I think the fact that you're

824
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:49,016
podium that it sits on, or base, is three feet six inches alone, right?

825
01:11:49,592 --> 01:11:51,132
And then you have your sign sitting above that.

826
01:11:51,152 --> 01:11:55,153
It makes it look like a real giant sign, in my opinion.

827
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:58,473
And maybe if we're able to downsize that a little bit.

828
01:11:59,854 --> 01:12:04,134
And I have no problem making it larger than what the current ordinance calls for.

829
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:04,915
Sure.

830
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:09,055
I have no problem making it a little larger than that, because your church is set back.

831
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:12,916
And I think this sign does represent, hey, we're here.

832
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:15,016
And I agree with that.

833
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,777
So if, yes.

834
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:18,057
If I can interrupt you for a second.

835
01:12:20,018 --> 01:12:22,840
The zoning board denied the sign.

836
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,523
They didn't deny this sign, they denied another sign.

837
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:30,307
So I think the first one she mentioned was the five foot sign?

838
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:30,627
Yes.

839
01:12:31,008 --> 01:12:37,113
That was the one denied, so now they're proposing a different sign than what was denied.

840
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:40,937
So this is a whole different sign than what was denied.

841
01:12:41,377 --> 01:12:44,280
So this wasn't the sign that was denied?

842
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:44,928
No.

843
01:12:45,689 --> 01:12:46,509
The 5-8.

844
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:52,093
The 5-8 was denied, so this one here would have to go through the process all over again, am I correct?

845
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:54,255
So which one's the 5-8, the one on the second page?

846
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:55,435
It's not even here.

847
01:12:55,555 --> 01:12:56,796
It's not even here.

848
01:12:57,897 --> 01:13:05,803
So again, this... The 5-8 was the one that was denied, so what we're saying is we can have a smaller size.

849
01:13:05,823 --> 01:13:07,183
But that's the one that you're appealing.

850
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:10,186
That's the one we're appealing, the 5-8.

851
01:13:10,206 --> 01:13:11,967
So this one here doesn't even come into play.

852
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:13,342
The 5'8"?

853
01:13:13,462 --> 01:13:15,043
No, this one here, this picture that you're showing.

854
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:17,264
This is 8 by 11.

855
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:18,384
Oh, no, no, no, no.

856
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:21,826
That's the 5'8 I made copies of.

857
01:13:22,906 --> 01:13:24,147
That wasn't the 5'8 I made copies of?

858
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,487
This looks a little bit bigger than the 5'8.

859
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:27,388
No, that's why, the 5'8 we would.

860
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:28,549
This is 11 feet high.

861
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:31,090
They're saying there's a six foot tall man here.

862
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,311
Oh, gosh, no.

863
01:13:33,551 --> 01:13:34,651
No, no, that's not it.

864
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:35,371
That's 5'8.

865
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:38,533
The one we're looking to put there is four.

866
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:40,204
4 by 5.

867
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:42,745
If you eliminated the pedestal, it would be like half size.

868
01:13:42,825 --> 01:13:45,006
Can we see that one?

869
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,106
Hang on one second.

870
01:13:46,266 --> 01:13:47,767
Oh my God.

871
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:47,827
No.

872
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:48,827
So where did this come from?

873
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:49,628
Yeah.

874
01:13:49,688 --> 01:13:50,488
Where did this come from?

875
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:54,769
I... The city didn't make this up for you, did they?

876
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,110
No.

877
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,431
It's a handsome six foot gentleman though.

878
01:13:58,491 --> 01:13:59,671
No, no, no, but the one that...

879
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:06,982
The one that I sent to them.

880
01:14:07,002 --> 01:14:09,384
Do you have a picture you could pass around to the council?

881
01:14:09,624 --> 01:14:09,984
Yes.

882
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:16,049
No, I think that's the one that I... Eight by 11.

883
01:14:16,089 --> 01:14:18,871
Yeah, I think that's the one that I sent.

884
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:20,152
Mr. President, we might as well refer to this.

885
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:22,173
Because you have the five by eight, right?

886
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:22,914
Is that the one you have?

887
01:14:22,994 --> 01:14:23,995
Yeah, why don't you do that?

888
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:24,955
We have eight by 11.

889
01:14:25,616 --> 01:14:27,817
Oh, no, that's the one that I meant to send.

890
01:14:27,837 --> 01:14:29,999
No, that's the one we have.

891
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:30,820
No, we don't have that one.

892
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,281
We don't have that one.

893
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,382
It's the same one.

894
01:14:34,402 --> 01:14:35,443
It's the same one, right?

895
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:38,464
It's the same exact one.

896
01:14:39,464 --> 01:14:43,445
Mr. President, can we refer this to the subcommittee as well, so we can clarify this?

897
01:14:43,465 --> 01:14:45,746
We're gonna meet very shortly, so yeah.

898
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:47,827
Might as well refer this.

899
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:50,268
We're gonna meet very shortly.

900
01:14:50,768 --> 01:14:59,611
Seeing that we have some confusion here with the petitioner, I'm gonna ask that we take the suggestion that this be referred to the subcommittee also.

901
01:14:59,631 --> 01:15:00,171
No, it's the sign.

902
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:00,791
Second, Mr. President.

903
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,552
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

904
01:15:02,692 --> 01:15:03,352
Move the question.

905
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,466
We didn't deny anything.

906
01:15:06,546 --> 01:15:11,390
No, I, I give you guys the motion by counselor night.

907
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:17,495
Yes.

908
01:15:18,776 --> 01:15:26,822
We now decide to buy the side at four by eight, not even five by eight.

909
01:15:27,283 --> 01:15:30,825
But there seems to be some confusion in the size of the sign.

910
01:15:31,626 --> 01:15:34,128
I think in the subcommittee it would be a lot easier getting it done.

911
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:41,922
If we can, we'll say, the setting is a little bit more informal, and I think everyone will know exactly what you want.

912
01:15:42,422 --> 01:15:51,350
We're gonna take Councilor Knight's motion to refer this to subcommittees, seconded by... Yes.

913
01:15:57,067 --> 01:16:00,828
What we're doing is we're gonna call for a meeting relatively quickly.

914
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:01,808
Okay.

915
01:16:02,008 --> 01:16:03,149
Hopefully by next Tuesday.

916
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:03,689
Okay.

917
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:17,173
So we can see the five foot sign, even the five foot by eight foot sign, and we can talk about that in subcommittee and then bring it back out to the floor if everything works out so we can have this done by next week.

918
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:19,113
Okay, so put some paperwork back to John.

919
01:16:19,133 --> 01:16:20,554
Right, just so we can see it, right.

920
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:20,774
Okay.

921
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:21,574
But please remember that.

922
01:16:21,614 --> 01:16:21,974
No, no.

923
01:16:22,514 --> 01:16:24,395
Bring a picture of the sign that you asked for originally.

924
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:25,315
Just bring it to us.

925
01:16:26,288 --> 01:16:27,149
Just bring that to us.

926
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:36,498
Our city clerk will contact you when we have that subcommittee meeting and you could bring those designs to us for what was denied and we can reverse that.

927
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:37,099
Okay.

928
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:37,659
Okay.

929
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,884
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott-Pelley.

930
01:16:42,004 --> 01:16:42,684
All those in favor?

931
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:43,025
Aye.

932
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:44,306
Motion passes.

933
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:45,467
Thank you.

934
01:16:45,527 --> 01:16:47,729
While we're under suspension, Councilor Langel-Kern.

935
01:16:49,018 --> 01:16:50,479
Paper in the hand of the clerk, please.

936
01:16:53,400 --> 01:17:08,786
Offered by Councilor Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South Street and Walnut Street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today.

937
01:17:09,467 --> 01:17:10,327
Councilor Longo Kern.

938
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:12,642
Thank you, President Carviello.

939
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:22,386
I'm just looking for an update, maybe from the Medford Police Department, as well as the mayor's office, the administration, with regards to permits being pulled.

940
01:17:22,566 --> 01:17:32,470
I've received a few text messages, an email, two phone calls, and a Facebook message with regards to residents being upset.

941
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:40,593
There were handwritten letters all around Walnut Street and South Street saying, do not park

942
01:17:41,343 --> 01:17:46,304
on Walnut and South, I believe it was sometime today until five o'clock tomorrow.

943
01:17:46,884 --> 01:17:49,085
It said violators will be towed.

944
01:17:49,605 --> 01:17:58,607
Now residents who live on South and Walnut and obviously have to park there through the night, tonight, were a little upset.

945
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:01,628
Most people didn't even call me first.

946
01:18:01,668 --> 01:18:04,489
They called the mayor's office, the police department.

947
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:10,470
Everybody's giving everybody just different information with regards to what's going on, why is there no parking,

948
01:18:10,973 --> 01:18:15,434
And then it became an issue with regards to, is this even being done legally?

949
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:17,134
Were the permits pulled?

950
01:18:17,714 --> 01:18:24,815
I didn't talk to any of the police department yet, but I have heard through the grapevine that no permits were pulled to post those signs.

951
01:18:25,395 --> 01:18:39,738
From what I understand, there is modular homes that were planned on coming down south and looping around down the one way down to Walnut to place the two modular homes on two, obviously, foundations.

952
01:18:40,346 --> 01:18:52,090
So after collecting all of the information today and trying to piece together the puzzle, catch up on what I had missed after work, it was a little late and I'm bringing it up tonight, a little late to call people.

953
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,392
I think I got the last of my information about 6.30 this evening.

954
01:18:56,052 --> 01:19:09,917
So if we could, as a council, get some updates because there are angry residents, people who are now upset because they feel like it was done incorrectly, to put it lightly.

955
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:14,557
And from what I understand, there were no permits pulled.

956
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:21,664
To bring modular homes, which are very large, pre-FAB homes, down two streets, down a one-way, you need detail.

957
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:26,229
And from what I understand, our police department knew nothing of it.

958
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:29,412
Details weren't hired, and permits were not pulled.

959
01:19:30,193 --> 01:19:31,434
I also, from what I understand,

960
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:35,585
didn't get a chance to contact the mayor's office, but a lot of the residents did.

961
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:38,206
And the mayor's office may have been lied to.

962
01:19:38,246 --> 01:19:40,367
I'm not quite sure of the full story.

963
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:47,831
So if we could get an update with regards to what permits were pulled, if they weren't pulled for today, were they pulled for a different day?

964
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,592
When is this going to happen?

965
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:53,594
How long is this going to take?

966
01:19:54,174 --> 01:19:55,875
How many detail will we have present?

967
01:19:55,915 --> 01:19:57,616
There's obviously a safety concern.

968
01:19:58,016 --> 01:19:58,977
There's a parking issue.

969
01:19:59,037 --> 01:20:00,978
People want to be able to park in their own homes.

970
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,460
Medcalf Street as well.

971
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:10,525
So we really want to get an idea of, so we can be able to respond to all the residents on those two streets.

972
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:12,807
South is a very long street as well.

973
01:20:12,887 --> 01:20:15,049
And people were really, really upset.

974
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:18,571
It affected, I think it went public.

975
01:20:18,611 --> 01:20:28,539
So people all over the community were really upset with what went on and how somebody's allowed to get away with basically lying to the neighborhood if it was so a lie and there were no permits pulled.

976
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:30,260
So I, as one, want to get

977
01:20:30,681 --> 01:20:45,545
it all taken care of, if this is gonna happen down the road, we wanna make sure permits are pulled, details in place, and the neighborhood is maybe given advance notice, two, three hour notice to not park or else you're gonna be towed, and a handwritten note, really concern people.

978
01:20:46,185 --> 01:20:54,727
So if we could get an update from the police department, our chief of police, or traffic division, as well as the mayor's office, I think that's necessary.

979
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:56,707
Thank you.

980
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:56,928
Yeah.

981
01:20:57,888 --> 01:20:58,548
Councilor Scarpelli.

982
01:20:59,516 --> 01:21:19,348
I appreciate Councilor Langelkern for bringing this up, but I think if we can add something, an amendment to this, that we also look into how we distribute signs and who distributes signs for the city during traffic and parking for other issues and concerns in the roads.

983
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:24,992
I know that I did talk to a contractor today who said that they actually

984
01:21:26,244 --> 01:21:28,005
do this in other areas of the city.

985
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:35,648
And there's really not a department that they can go to that has these signs when they legitimately close the street down.

986
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:41,990
And they actually use City of Boston signs and cross out Boston, put in Medford.

987
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:55,175
So if we can get some information back from, I don't know if it's the engineering department, if it's the DPW, but if we can get some guidance there, I'd really appreciate it.

988
01:21:55,395 --> 01:21:55,655
Thank you.

989
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:56,923
Councilor Knight.

990
01:21:57,263 --> 01:21:58,564
Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

991
01:22:00,465 --> 01:22:05,768
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by... Name and address of the record, please.

992
01:22:06,228 --> 01:22:07,349
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

993
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:08,709
I live at 281 Park Street.

994
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:23,597
I did see a couple of versions of the sign that was supposed to close the street down, and residents were going back and forth, and I received a message from a friend asking me if this was a real sign, because people weren't sure if it was a real sign.

995
01:22:23,987 --> 01:22:26,088
And if they had to stop parking there at 5 p.m.

996
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:27,369
today till 8 p.m.

997
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,590
tomorrow, that was certainly a hardship for people that live in that area.

998
01:22:30,911 --> 01:22:34,993
And who wants to try to rearrange your life if it's not a real sign?

999
01:22:35,473 --> 01:22:41,556
So I did, in fact, go in person to the mayor's office, and I was helped by Ms.

1000
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:43,877
Lauren Felch, who was extremely helpful.

1001
01:22:43,937 --> 01:22:50,641
She pulled up the flyer, she called the developer, or who she believes was the developer,

1002
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:52,543
It was the number on the flyer.

1003
01:22:52,563 --> 01:23:00,132
It was not a city number and was told that in fact they had gotten all the permissions that they needed and that the home would be being moved tomorrow.

1004
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:02,635
And it would be coming in at 7 a.m.

1005
01:23:03,155 --> 01:23:04,137
She asked him why.

1006
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:07,728
People weren't allowed to park there at 5 p.m., and he wasn't sure.

1007
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:26,284
When she concluded the call, I asked her if it was possible if she could confirm that there were permissions granted, and if there were permissions, if the city could send out a reverse 911 call, because it was really important that people knew that this really was happening, and this wasn't a sign, a fake sign that had been put up.

1008
01:23:26,384 --> 01:23:26,684
And Ms.

1009
01:23:26,724 --> 01:23:33,110
Felch had expressed that a year prior, someone had put up signs that said street cleaning was happening in some neighborhood that were handwritten,

1010
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,972
And people had moved and it turned out to not be true.

1011
01:23:36,032 --> 01:23:40,115
So she understood that a lot of people probably wouldn't believe this was a real sign.

1012
01:23:40,635 --> 01:23:49,102
The last information that I received when she called back after she had called various offices was that the project was halted for now.

1013
01:23:49,322 --> 01:23:52,765
So anyone that lives in that area can park in that area.

1014
01:23:52,805 --> 01:23:56,728
They'll be able to go to work in the morning because the house is not being moved now.

1015
01:23:57,248 --> 01:24:00,911
It's my understanding that this is not the first home that he has moved in this way.

1016
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:04,793
So I'm curious to know if he's violating some sort of rule.

1017
01:24:04,853 --> 01:24:11,738
Is there a department that's supposed to oversee when these homes are being moved, if streets are being closed off?

1018
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:13,559
Is safety being factored in?

1019
01:24:13,599 --> 01:24:18,842
Had this home been moving through the neighborhood at 7 o'clock in the morning, school children would be out and about.

1020
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,543
People would be trying to go to work.

1021
01:24:20,904 --> 01:24:25,607
People would be going into their cars to get out of their driveway and find out that they can't leave.

1022
01:24:26,507 --> 01:24:54,613
And if this has happened before and we didn't know about it shame on us So I hope that you all can look into it and find out what the process is This developer does own two to three more parcels in the city planning on doing similar things to those parcels So it'd be great if he could have a plan From the city on exactly what he is supposed to do step by step before he moves a modular home into our community So that we don't have someone get hurt or miss work or or anything.

1023
01:24:55,233 --> 01:24:55,593
Thank you.

1024
01:24:55,773 --> 01:24:56,053
Thank you

1025
01:24:58,521 --> 01:24:59,664
Name and address of the record, please.

1026
01:25:00,526 --> 01:25:02,131
Gene Duzo, 35 Power Street.

1027
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:05,459
So I've been following this issue on social media.

1028
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:12,548
And I think that what we have here is a systematic issue.

1029
01:25:13,148 --> 01:25:28,435
And this all stems back, in my opinion, to the fact that these individuals coming into our city to flip properties are not encouraged nor are they required to engage with the neighborhoods that they're working in.

1030
01:25:28,955 --> 01:25:31,216
Because they know they'll go to our ZBA.

1031
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:57,451
They'll get whatever their variances are regardless of what our residents have to say and This is just a complete Lack of respect for the people in the neighborhood, you know working in the industry If you asked anybody who is truly involved in the industry and not someone who's just flipping properties, but large-scale developers commercial high-end residential large-scale residential

1032
01:25:58,123 --> 01:26:04,105
They wouldn't dream of doing something like this without some type of community meeting to advise people of what's going on.

1033
01:26:05,146 --> 01:26:12,388
They wouldn't come down these streets without the proper details in place and logistics in place.

1034
01:26:12,508 --> 01:26:16,390
And I'm not speaking specifically about this developer.

1035
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:17,851
I'm speaking in general.

1036
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:23,152
If you walk around and you speak with people, this is happening everywhere.

1037
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:33,435
Folks are coming in, they're executing their construction projects, and they're not keeping the folks around involved and informed as to what's happening.

1038
01:26:33,575 --> 01:26:37,437
It doesn't matter if it's a single unit, three units, or 490.

1039
01:26:37,477 --> 01:26:39,537
When you're building and you're around people,

1040
01:26:42,195 --> 01:26:44,398
You have a responsibility to advise them.

1041
01:26:44,878 --> 01:26:48,703
And so I can appreciate that there are time constraints.

1042
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:52,487
Perhaps the developer didn't have as much lead time for this delivery.

1043
01:26:53,108 --> 01:27:00,217
But I feel if we did a better job at making sure that folks coming into our city to build

1044
01:27:00,697 --> 01:27:15,951
whatever it is, engaged with the people they would be working around and working in their neighborhoods where their homes are, things like this would not be happening and we wouldn't have folks as upset and concerned as they have been.

1045
01:27:16,852 --> 01:27:20,936
So I would hope that we would look at this as a larger issue.

1046
01:27:20,956 --> 01:27:22,417
I think it ties

1047
01:27:23,298 --> 01:27:30,025
to how we engage and how we communicate across the board with all of these various projects.

1048
01:27:30,105 --> 01:27:40,256
Not this particular neighborhood, not this particular developer, but overall there's really no mechanism that truly reaches everybody and I think that I would

1049
01:27:40,976 --> 01:28:04,592
Ask you guys as you discuss this further and look into it further that you think about This issue because as I said I think that if we had those vehicles in place and we had those opportunities for some of these community meetings And getting folks engaged in their neighborhoods to talk with these people We we would do better and maybe feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on.

1050
01:28:05,272 --> 01:28:05,712
Thanks.

1051
01:28:05,973 --> 01:28:09,515
Thank you on the motion by council night to move the question on

1052
01:28:14,616 --> 01:28:15,236
Councilor Locker?

1053
01:28:15,276 --> 01:28:16,457
Thank you, President Carviello.

1054
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:19,458
Briefly, if we could just amend this and ask what is the procedure?

1055
01:28:19,518 --> 01:28:22,919
What would someone have to do to move a modular home in Medford?

1056
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:27,301
If there is a procedure out there, if we could maybe get a copy of that, that'd be great.

1057
01:28:27,321 --> 01:28:27,801
Thank you.

1058
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,382
I move approval, second the approval, and move approval.

1059
01:28:30,402 --> 01:28:31,602
Roll call vote, please.

1060
01:28:32,003 --> 01:28:32,463
Councilor Knight?

1061
01:28:33,823 --> 01:28:36,264
Can the clerk please read back the resolution and amendments?

1062
01:28:36,404 --> 01:28:38,265
Mr. Clerk, could you please read back the resolution?

1063
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,582
I can hear be resolved.

1064
01:28:49,622 --> 01:29:03,290
The Memphis city council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South street and Walnut street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today.

1065
01:29:04,271 --> 01:29:10,895
And we have an amendment by a council Scott Pelly on, um, how the distribution of signs, uh,

1066
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:17,039
works in the city for, uh, for other issues on the roadway.

1067
01:29:17,059 --> 01:29:24,561
And of course, uh, console long occurrent is a procedure on, uh, moving modular housing, modular homes.

1068
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:27,342
Second, the approval.

1069
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:27,762
Mr. President.

1070
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:30,943
We'll call what's been requested.

1071
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:31,563
Mr. Clerk.

1072
01:29:34,324 --> 01:29:35,244
Councilor DelaRusso.

1073
01:29:39,446 --> 01:29:40,166
Councilor Falco.

1074
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:40,486
Yes.

1075
01:29:41,435 --> 01:29:41,935
Councilor Knight?

1076
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:43,816
Yes.

1077
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:44,476
Councilor Kern?

1078
01:29:44,596 --> 01:29:45,237
Yes.

1079
01:29:45,257 --> 01:29:46,177
Vice President Marks?

1080
01:29:46,357 --> 01:29:46,617
Yes.

1081
01:29:46,937 --> 01:29:47,858
Councilor Scott Pelley?

1082
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:48,238
Yes.

1083
01:29:48,818 --> 01:29:49,658
President Caviello?

1084
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:50,038
Yes.

1085
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:52,800
Six in the affirmative, one absence.

1086
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:02,303
Communications from the mayor.

1087
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:02,303
17455.

1088
01:30:05,805 --> 01:30:08,666
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully

1089
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:13,949
request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the following resolution.

1090
01:30:13,969 --> 01:30:19,291
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading as brief synopsis by the Director of the Board of Health.

1091
01:30:19,311 --> 01:30:19,511
Thank you.

1092
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:27,813
On the motion by Councilor Knight to waive the reading, and if the Board of Health Director could give a brief synopsis, we'd appreciate it.

1093
01:30:28,053 --> 01:30:28,973
Name and address for the record.

1094
01:30:29,413 --> 01:30:33,014
I'm Marian O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health, Medford.

1095
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:35,055
Thank you for having us tonight.

1096
01:30:36,822 --> 01:30:49,252
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region 1, has completed its review of Medford's hazard mitigation plan and found it approvable pending adoption by this honorable body.

1097
01:30:51,213 --> 01:31:00,060
It's my understanding that upon adoption, a formal letter will be sent from FEMA, which will be in effect for five years.

1098
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:05,944
This formal approval will confirm Medford's eligibility to apply for mitigation grants.

1099
01:31:06,548 --> 01:31:07,668
administered by FEMA.

1100
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:14,471
If not adopted, we would have to update the entire plan and submit again for FEMA review.

1101
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:18,252
And so, you know, this has been a very long process.

1102
01:31:18,952 --> 01:31:27,996
And I have with me Martin Pillsbury, who is with the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, who has been involved in this process for several years.

1103
01:31:29,096 --> 01:31:31,457
It took several years for this plan to get approved.

1104
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:32,917
If I could interrupt you.

1105
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:34,558
Excuse me, in the back, please.

1106
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:36,265
Other people speaking here.

1107
01:31:36,305 --> 01:31:36,605
Thank you.

1108
01:31:38,686 --> 01:31:44,448
So Mr. Pillsbury could address any specific plants about the, uh, questions about the plan itself.

1109
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:47,049
Counselor knife.

1110
01:31:47,749 --> 01:31:48,950
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1111
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,710
Mr. O'Connor, thank you for being here this evening.

1112
01:31:50,991 --> 01:32:03,315
Uh, also to you, um, Mr. Pillsbury, um, question that I have would be, um, whereas you're coming from the metropolitan area planning council, um, I'm sure that you have,

1113
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:07,340
of vast exposure to a number of these type of plans in our surrounding communities.

1114
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:13,783
So the first question that I'd ask would be, how does this plan measure up to those plans that are established in surrounding communities, number one?

1115
01:32:13,803 --> 01:32:23,649
And number two, is there a regional focus that's taken when these plans are put together so that if a disaster does strike and there needs to be mitigation, is there a regional response or is it more of a local response?

1116
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:25,069
Thank you.

1117
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:26,190
Very good questions indeed.

1118
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:33,694
In fact, most of your neighboring, many of your neighboring cities and towns have recently been through the same process of developing a plan.

1119
01:32:34,498 --> 01:32:38,961
I'm expecting this is going to be in front of the city of Malden sometime in the next few weeks as well.

1120
01:32:39,561 --> 01:32:46,405
And in the last less than a year or so, it came up and was approved in Somerville, Cambridge, Everett, Chelsea.

1121
01:32:46,926 --> 01:32:54,070
This was part of a regional group of eight cities and towns that originally came together to do an update of your plans.

1122
01:32:54,130 --> 01:33:00,254
And I should say that this is an update to your original hazard mitigation plan, which was adopted back in 2008.

1123
01:33:00,514 --> 01:33:02,355
That was the first of these kinds of plans.

1124
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:03,936
The program was new at the time.

1125
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:09,388
And the way FEMA has structured this, the plans need to be renewed on a periodic basis.

1126
01:33:09,468 --> 01:33:15,051
So this is your first renewal of your original plan, and as was also the case for all of your neighboring communities.

1127
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:19,473
Basically, FEMA is very prescriptive about what goes in these plans.

1128
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:24,616
There are literally codes of federal regulations that say, here's what the chapters and sections of the plan need to be.

1129
01:33:25,116 --> 01:33:31,500
So your plans are very equivalent to your neighbor's plans, because they pretty much all have to, in order to get FEMA approval, they all have to follow sort

1130
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:34,579
a similar consistent format.

1131
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,460
And one other question, Mr. President.

1132
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:46,944
Now, Mr. Pillsbury, you are a professional in the field of environmental planning, and I don't know where you live, but with this plan in place, would you feel safe and comfortable living in the city of Medford?

1133
01:33:47,624 --> 01:33:48,144
Absolutely.

1134
01:33:48,204 --> 01:33:50,285
I think this plan will really help the city.

1135
01:33:50,925 --> 01:34:02,110
You'll see that it outlines a number of steps you can take over the next five years to put in place improvements to your infrastructure and drainage that would mitigate the kinds of flooding that you have.

1136
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:09,552
And I should add that it was mentioned that when you have a plan like this approved, that makes the city eligible for FEMA grants.

1137
01:34:09,932 --> 01:34:18,599
And in fact, under your previous plan, the city did get a FEMA grant for work at Wright's Pond Dam, which was over a half a million dollar grant from FEMA.

1138
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:26,226
So that's the kind of project, and there are a number of suggested projects in this plan that could be looked at in the next five years, some of which may be eligible for similar FEMA grants.

1139
01:34:27,046 --> 01:34:27,306
Excellent.

1140
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:28,608
Thank you, Mr. President.

1141
01:34:28,648 --> 01:34:31,510
Based upon the discussion here, I feel comfortable

1142
01:34:31,857 --> 01:34:33,578
voting in favor of this matter this evening.

1143
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:34,899
Councilor Falco.

1144
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:36,319
Thank you, Mr. President.

1145
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,942
Uh, you had mentioned a minute ago that, uh, it's, uh, there's a periodic, uh, renewal.

1146
01:34:42,342 --> 01:34:45,424
So is it, is it every so many years, five years, every five years?

1147
01:34:45,444 --> 01:34:48,886
And does it usually take as, does it usually take as long as this took?

1148
01:34:49,746 --> 01:34:50,927
It seems like this was a bit lengthy.

1149
01:34:50,947 --> 01:34:57,350
This took longer than average in a couple of your neighboring cities got into a situation here where a FEMA at the national level,

1150
01:34:57,786 --> 01:35:03,050
right in the middle of this process, changed the rules, basically, and changed the guidelines.

1151
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:08,073
And basically, we were thinking, OK, they're not going to change horses in midstream.

1152
01:35:08,113 --> 01:35:09,814
We started the plan under the old guidelines.

1153
01:35:09,854 --> 01:35:13,497
But no, in fact, they insisted that the plan kind of be upgraded to the new.

1154
01:35:13,777 --> 01:35:23,343
And actually, it makes a better plan, because the change of guidelines that FEMA put in place was based on national experience over the first decade or so of this program.

1155
01:35:23,363 --> 01:35:25,244
So it actually made the plan better.

1156
01:35:25,284 --> 01:35:26,185
But it also required

1157
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:31,765
more extensive review, and the review of the draft plan has to go through two levels of review.

1158
01:35:31,985 --> 01:35:35,846
It goes through MEMA, the Mass Emergency Management Agency, and then also through FEMA.

1159
01:35:36,346 --> 01:35:39,347
And in this case, because of the change in rules, it went through that process twice.

1160
01:35:39,407 --> 01:35:46,849
So it took longer to get through to the end of the process, but you have now got the approval letter from FEMA, and it's all over except for shouting, as they say.

1161
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:47,370
Okay.

1162
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:48,270
Thank you very much.

1163
01:35:50,997 --> 01:35:51,637
Council Member Kern.

1164
01:35:52,077 --> 01:35:57,178
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you for coming to explain everything to us.

1165
01:35:57,438 --> 01:35:57,899
My pleasure.

1166
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:16,663
From what I understand after reading some of the report, this was meetings that took place in Medford from around 2012, 2013 to the present, and then was put together, and as you had just spoken about, is mainly flooding is the main, obviously storms, hurricanes, things like that, we're concerned about.

1167
01:36:18,435 --> 01:36:28,984
my, my main question really would be to the, to the city with regards to making sure this, this was a hundred page document, I believe, and making sure it's like on the city website so people can access it.

1168
01:36:29,004 --> 01:36:33,408
I think it's important to be able to get the answer questions answered.

1169
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:42,776
We can't talk about it all tonight, the hundred pages, but are there any specific points that you think are important for the public to know?

1170
01:36:42,796 --> 01:36:42,837
Um,

1171
01:36:44,018 --> 01:36:47,220
obviously live tonight, but then also we want to make sure it's on the website.

1172
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,281
We will absolutely make it available.

1173
01:36:49,321 --> 01:36:52,663
I have a hard copy here, but it's available as a PDF that can be put on the website.

1174
01:36:52,723 --> 01:37:01,128
In fact, when it was a draft and we had the public meetings, that draft was put on the website and was available for public comment during the production of the plan.

1175
01:37:01,188 --> 01:37:04,289
But now that it's finalized, you want everyone to know what's in there.

1176
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:10,693
I guess I would say if anyone gets a chance to look at this a little bit later on, once it's up online, to look at the tables near the back of the plan,

1177
01:37:11,312 --> 01:37:16,615
table 28 that actually lists the recommended measures, different drainage improvements and other steps.

1178
01:37:16,675 --> 01:37:25,979
That's really the heart of the plan saying, here's the things you can actually do that would make the city more resilient and less vulnerable to some of these hazards.

1179
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,380
Thank you.

1180
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:28,560
Thank you.

1181
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:29,781
Councilor Mox.

1182
01:37:30,683 --> 01:37:31,624
Thank you, Mr. President.

1183
01:37:31,744 --> 01:37:33,564
And I, too, went through the report.

1184
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:39,107
I can remember last time it was presented, we actually had a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1185
01:37:39,727 --> 01:37:40,147
That's right.

1186
01:37:40,207 --> 01:37:47,531
And we discussed this with the entire council, because it is such an in-depth report, and there's many facets to this report.

1187
01:37:48,871 --> 01:37:49,812
My question is to you.

1188
01:37:50,112 --> 01:37:51,893
You just mentioned recommendations.

1189
01:37:52,553 --> 01:37:58,896
And you're right, there are recommendations that were in the last five-year plan that are still carried over into the next plan.

1190
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,056
Some of them are, that's right.

1191
01:38:00,316 --> 01:38:00,857
Some of them are.

1192
01:38:02,337 --> 01:38:06,779
I can remember the last several budgets that have come before this council.

1193
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:18,985
I don't recall anything the administration has brought before us, to be quite frank with you, in ways of allocations to address some of the recommendations that were made in the last report.

1194
01:38:19,385 --> 01:38:21,886
Now, that may have happened, and I'm not aware of it,

1195
01:38:22,386 --> 01:38:25,128
but I don't remember anything in the budgetary process.

1196
01:38:26,028 --> 01:38:30,591
When I looked at, I forget what section it was under, I believe it was recommendations.

1197
01:38:30,651 --> 01:38:33,412
They scaled it high, moderate and low.

1198
01:38:33,952 --> 01:38:43,578
And whether it was a high benefit to do this particular project or what the risk was, you know, and based on high, low or moderate.

1199
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:50,822
Now the areas of concern that I have that have been of concern for many years in this community are Main Street,

1200
01:38:51,382 --> 01:38:55,364
in Mystic Ave, in between, the whole neighborhood in between Mystic Ave and Main Street.

1201
01:38:55,985 --> 01:39:00,887
And that was considered, I believe, a very high priority due to poor drainage.

1202
01:39:02,128 --> 01:39:09,372
The same also applies to some sections of North Meffitt, which we refer to the Heights, which also have poor drainage.

1203
01:39:10,912 --> 01:39:18,797
I just want to make sure that we're not just putting out a report for the sake of putting out a report and hopefully getting some funding.

1204
01:39:19,713 --> 01:39:22,394
We always welcome funding, especially from the federal government.

1205
01:39:22,834 --> 01:39:26,655
But I just hope it's not a report that really has no teeth to it.

1206
01:39:27,296 --> 01:39:34,458
And I'd like to see we have over $7 million in our water and sewer enterprise account for these exact projects.

1207
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:41,892
for drainage issues, for issues that I think could be addressed with some of that money.

1208
01:39:42,553 --> 01:39:49,417
So I don't know if you can address that or not, but my concern is, you know, the flooding.

1209
01:39:50,077 --> 01:39:57,021
I know some of the recommendations were as simple as we're notifying businesses to clean their catch basins on private property.

1210
01:39:57,542 --> 01:40:02,905
Now that sounds like a no-brainer, but what percent of people adhere to that?

1211
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:04,346
I mean, is there any follow-up?

1212
01:40:05,472 --> 01:40:09,602
I could tell you the catch basins on streets, even though they're supposedly cleaned once a year.

1213
01:40:10,453 --> 01:40:14,174
they're in deplorable conditions throughout the community, to be quite frank with you.

1214
01:40:15,054 --> 01:40:20,516
Many of them are clogged and are in very poor condition, which leads to additional flooding.

1215
01:40:20,576 --> 01:40:37,741
So I'm hoping that it's not just a report in name only, that these recommendations are taken seriously by this administration, and they put forth, if we don't get grants, funding in the budget to address some of these very serious drainage issues.

1216
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:40,182
Because when your basement has a foot of water in it,

1217
01:40:40,609 --> 01:40:43,372
That's a very major concern for a lot of residents.

1218
01:40:43,772 --> 01:40:53,843
And when I'm at meetings in the Heights and a woman's telling me up around Tamar Drive that her water pump runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, I'm concerned.

1219
01:40:54,744 --> 01:40:56,707
Those are concerning issues.

1220
01:40:57,087 --> 01:40:59,309
So I don't know if you can address that in particular.

1221
01:41:00,153 --> 01:41:02,895
Vice President Marks, let me say that that's music to my ears.

1222
01:41:02,975 --> 01:41:11,142
As a planner, the thing we worry about most is trying our best to make a good plan and then having it proverbially gather dust on a shelf because no one implements it.

1223
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:21,811
So you're right on target to what, now you have a good plan here, it's been looked at by a lot of eyes and through FEMA and MEMA, and now it's really on the city to, over the next five years, implement parts of this plan.

1224
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:23,172
Now on the positive side,

1225
01:41:23,556 --> 01:41:28,179
This plan did go back and look at the recommendations made in your last plan and said, what happened to them?

1226
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,820
And there's a table right in here.

1227
01:41:30,261 --> 01:41:31,362
Some of them were completed.

1228
01:41:32,002 --> 01:41:39,888
And those that weren't completed, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough funding or whatever the reason may be, we re-looked at them and say, are these still relevant recommendations?

1229
01:41:39,908 --> 01:41:40,568
They haven't been done.

1230
01:41:40,588 --> 01:41:41,569
Should they be carried in?

1231
01:41:41,969 --> 01:41:42,770
And they were.

1232
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,011
We also added some new recommendations.

1233
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:47,133
But over the course of the next five years,

1234
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:54,147
The idea is that you don't just sort of set this aside and wait for five years to come and renew the plan for the sake of just having a plan.

1235
01:41:54,507 --> 01:42:03,512
There's actually a process in the back spelled out by which the city would continue to occasionally convene this group that helped to put the plan together, because it's a very interdisciplinary effort.

1236
01:42:03,532 --> 01:42:07,214
It has lots of different departments and commissions and boards involved.

1237
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:14,078
And it's a vision that you would, over time, take from these recommendations and move some of them ahead as you can, whether it's through a FEMA grant

1238
01:42:14,798 --> 01:42:16,199
or through your own city funding.

1239
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:24,562
And the table in here actually spells out where some of these might have to just be city funding because they're important, but they may not all be eligible for FEMA money.

1240
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:31,364
And even those that are eligible for FEMA funding, FEMA requires a 25% local match for all of their grants.

1241
01:42:31,384 --> 01:42:37,607
They'll pay you 75% of the cost, but you still have to be prepared to put up something as well for those grants.

1242
01:42:37,767 --> 01:42:44,069
So it's very important what you say about keeping the implementation of this and making sure that it's not just a plan that gathers dust.

1243
01:42:44,812 --> 01:42:46,433
So just if I can ask you my last question.

1244
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:48,855
So FEMA requires the report.

1245
01:42:49,515 --> 01:42:51,577
It requires cities and towns to present.

1246
01:42:52,057 --> 01:42:54,098
If I could answer that, they actually don't require.

1247
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:56,980
This is not a mandate like an unfunded mandate.

1248
01:42:57,181 --> 01:42:57,441
Okay.

1249
01:42:57,501 --> 01:42:59,522
What they do is they put the incentive in.

1250
01:42:59,682 --> 01:43:03,405
If you want any FEMA grants under this program, you have to have an approved plan.

1251
01:43:03,565 --> 01:43:04,526
So it's an incentive.

1252
01:43:05,466 --> 01:43:12,151
If you didn't ever care about getting a FEMA grant, you wouldn't have to do one of these plans and there would be no penalty other than that.

1253
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:19,816
So there's no associated timeline that FEMA puts out saying, you know what, okay, these are your recommendations, Matthew.

1254
01:43:19,836 --> 01:43:21,477
We appreciate you putting together this report.

1255
01:43:21,798 --> 01:43:23,359
You're eligible for grant funding now.

1256
01:43:23,779 --> 01:43:31,986
However, we would like to see a percentage of these particular recommendations implemented by X date, or at least reviewed by.

1257
01:43:32,086 --> 01:43:33,507
You're asking some very good questions.

1258
01:43:33,527 --> 01:43:38,531
The table of recommendations actually puts some target dates on when over the five years.

1259
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,313
Would this one be in the first year or two?

1260
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:43,195
would this one be in year three or this one be in year five?

1261
01:43:43,576 --> 01:43:48,820
You actually have that in there based on the city's team's best estimate of when some of these would be.

1262
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:55,565
But I will say that in the interim five years, FEMA does not come back and look over your shoulder and say, now are you making progress?

1263
01:43:55,966 --> 01:43:58,468
When you come and do your next five-year update, however,

1264
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:03,571
That's when you'll have to kind of, the day of reckoning will come to say, what did you do with this over the last five years?

1265
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:05,431
And did you, what did you implement and what didn't you?

1266
01:44:05,951 --> 01:44:07,752
So that's the time when it will come.

1267
01:44:08,112 --> 01:44:10,772
You don't want to wait until the last minute and be caught up short.

1268
01:44:11,052 --> 01:44:13,433
Have you ever seen FEMA deny a report?

1269
01:44:14,433 --> 01:44:15,833
Oh, well, the plan.

1270
01:44:16,213 --> 01:44:18,113
Have you ever seen FEMA deny one?

1271
01:44:18,193 --> 01:44:20,974
They have, they don't use the term deny.

1272
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:26,735
What they have done is returned draft plans with revisions required.

1273
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:30,271
And that's actually part of what happened here because of the change in regulations.

1274
01:44:30,331 --> 01:44:34,893
The plan that was originally submitted met the old regulations, but didn't meet the new ones.

1275
01:44:34,993 --> 01:44:38,174
And so they will often return these plans basically with revisions.

1276
01:44:38,274 --> 01:44:42,676
It's like turning in a paper to your professor and getting it marked up and say, go back and fix this.

1277
01:44:42,756 --> 01:44:48,898
And so that, but that's in the interest of making a better plan, not to be punitive to the community, to making a better, more complete plan.

1278
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:52,780
And just, Mr. President, my other question is to the board of health director.

1279
01:44:53,788 --> 01:45:09,361
Now that you are acting, I guess, full-time or part-time as the emergency preparedness person in the community, where we used to have someone that did it as their job, although it may not have been a full-time job, that was what they were dedicated to do.

1280
01:45:10,061 --> 01:45:17,167
How are you finding that now in your role, a very busy office at Border Health, a number of employees underneath you, a lot of issues?

1281
01:45:17,647 --> 01:45:22,831
Are you finding yourself being able to spend ample time as the emergency preparedness person for this community?

1282
01:45:23,836 --> 01:45:26,177
I think you could spend a lot more time doing it.

1283
01:45:26,197 --> 01:45:32,860
It certainly could be a full-time job, but as part of public health, we do emergency preparedness planning all the time, too.

1284
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,822
So it's been able to be part of my job, as well as working with MIMR.

1285
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:41,964
I'm part of the emergency management director group with MIMR.

1286
01:45:42,264 --> 01:45:47,327
So I've been keeping up with them and trying to get a local committee together, because it's not just a one-man job.

1287
01:45:47,587 --> 01:45:52,449
Emergency preparedness is really a huge job that requires multidisciplinary teams.

1288
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:58,565
That's what we're trying to develop, but I will be working to get a team together again to look at this plan.

1289
01:45:58,585 --> 01:46:06,312
I already talked with the energy and environmental folks and we're going to be getting a local committee back together again to really revisit this plan and see what we can get done.

1290
01:46:06,812 --> 01:46:11,577
So currently right now we don't have a local, uh, committee for emergency preparedness.

1291
01:46:11,637 --> 01:46:12,317
It's just yourself.

1292
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:13,699
Well, correct.

1293
01:46:14,059 --> 01:46:14,299
Correct.

1294
01:46:14,379 --> 01:46:14,639
Okay.

1295
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,601
And in the past there was a committee.

1296
01:46:16,981 --> 01:46:17,722
I'm not aware of that.

1297
01:46:17,782 --> 01:46:17,902
Is it?

1298
01:46:17,922 --> 01:46:17,942
I,

1299
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:32,556
I believe that they should have been if there wasn't, but yeah, usually it's your public safety folks, you know, um, public health building, uh, mostly community development, people who would be involved in the city.

1300
01:46:32,756 --> 01:46:32,956
Yeah.

1301
01:46:34,017 --> 01:46:35,677
I just want to thank you both for your time and effort.

1302
01:46:35,697 --> 01:46:38,999
This was a very lengthy and thorough, uh, report put together.

1303
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:42,641
Um, and, uh, I think it does benefit the community.

1304
01:46:43,121 --> 01:46:43,341
Thank you.

1305
01:46:43,461 --> 01:46:43,821
Thank you.

1306
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:44,782
Madam director.

1307
01:46:44,842 --> 01:46:47,643
If I could ask a question as, as a reviewing the report, um,

1308
01:46:50,073 --> 01:46:54,495
Mr. Mangoni is still listed as the person on the, if we could take his name off.

1309
01:46:54,555 --> 01:46:59,477
So if somebody wants to contact somebody and replace it with the proper person would be, would be appreciated.

1310
01:46:59,497 --> 01:47:00,937
We'll have to update that whole committee.

1311
01:47:01,057 --> 01:47:04,699
If you can do that before you publish it to the webpage would be appreciated.

1312
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:06,280
Counselor Falco.

1313
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,440
Thank you, Mr. President.

1314
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,141
I have a couple of quick additional questions.

1315
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:14,363
Um, so you had mentioned about, uh, this being a full time position.

1316
01:47:14,383 --> 01:47:16,944
There's enough work to make it a full time position.

1317
01:47:17,832 --> 01:47:22,095
You could spend, emergency preparedness, you could really spend a lot of time.

1318
01:47:23,396 --> 01:47:29,240
In your experience throughout the years, do you see other cities and towns that actually have a full-time person?

1319
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:29,920
I'm just curious.

1320
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,721
There are a few that have full-time.

1321
01:47:31,981 --> 01:47:37,365
A lot of them have part-time, but certainly there are communities with full-time emergency management directors.

1322
01:47:38,706 --> 01:47:44,129
Do they more or less communities that maybe live closer to the coast or that are closer to the coast, I guess, or is it just in general?

1323
01:47:45,704 --> 01:47:48,006
It varies, not based on location.

1324
01:47:48,366 --> 01:47:49,507
It's usually size.

1325
01:47:49,968 --> 01:47:50,548
Size, okay.

1326
01:47:50,588 --> 01:47:51,169
That makes sense.

1327
01:47:51,789 --> 01:47:58,555
And as far as you had mentioned about putting a committee together, that committee's not together yet?

1328
01:47:58,995 --> 01:47:59,316
Not yet.

1329
01:47:59,496 --> 01:48:00,196
We're working on it.

1330
01:48:00,217 --> 01:48:01,157
Do you know when that will be?

1331
01:48:01,658 --> 01:48:04,460
When the goal is to actually have the committee get together and meet?

1332
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,063
I'd like to try to get a meeting together in June and then start quarterly meetings.

1333
01:48:08,283 --> 01:48:08,844
Okay, great.

1334
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,685
Sounds good.

1335
01:48:09,745 --> 01:48:10,385
Thank you very much.

1336
01:48:11,927 --> 01:48:12,287
Thank you.

1337
01:48:12,787 --> 01:48:13,328
Thank you very much.

1338
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:19,617
Name and address of the record, please.

1339
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:21,638
Thank you, Mr. President.

1340
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:23,958
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1341
01:48:24,758 --> 01:48:28,519
Before they leave, if I could ask them some questions through the chair.

1342
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:40,681
Having not read this report yet, and I intend to, I'm a little bit in the dark, my question pertains to the funding grants that are possible.

1343
01:48:41,541 --> 01:48:45,102
From what I'm hearing tonight, this sounds like it's like

1344
01:48:46,392 --> 01:48:52,456
expressly for like some kind of natural disaster where health concerns are.

1345
01:48:53,617 --> 01:49:01,121
But through the funding that we're now available for, what kind of grants could the city of Medford apply for?

1346
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:07,165
Such as a few weeks ago, Councilor Knight brought up the EpiPens for first responders.

1347
01:49:07,465 --> 01:49:08,525
Could we get funding for that?

1348
01:49:09,286 --> 01:49:10,947
Perhaps for police?

1349
01:49:11,007 --> 01:49:12,508
These have been for natural disasters.

1350
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:15,064
Oh, specifically just for natural disasters?

1351
01:49:15,365 --> 01:49:15,805
Yes.

1352
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:19,047
Well, then I guess that answers all my questions.

1353
01:49:19,087 --> 01:49:20,028
I don't have to address them.

1354
01:49:20,248 --> 01:49:21,849
But one last question to the city.

1355
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:27,873
I know Councilor Brianna Lungo-Kern has brought up often hiring a full-time grant writer.

1356
01:49:28,093 --> 01:49:29,674
Has the city of Medford done that yet?

1357
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:30,515
Not to my knowledge.

1358
01:49:30,815 --> 01:49:31,055
OK.

1359
01:49:31,275 --> 01:49:32,056
Thank you, Mr. President.

1360
01:49:32,076 --> 01:49:32,356
Thank you.

1361
01:49:35,959 --> 01:49:37,099
Name and address of the record, please.

1362
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:40,542
Thank you, Council President Andrew Cast and Eddie Cushion Street.

1363
01:49:41,223 --> 01:49:42,544
Method mask.

1364
01:49:42,984 --> 01:49:47,288
To the chair, I would like to ask the... To the chair.

1365
01:49:47,928 --> 01:49:56,555
To the chair, ask the director of the Board of Health, I'm sorry, the director of environmental planning of the Metropolitan Area Council.

1366
01:49:58,937 --> 01:50:07,564
I've been hearing some words about flooding and national disasters and things of that nature.

1367
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:11,431
and with the melt and ice caps, so they say.

1368
01:50:12,151 --> 01:50:13,591
I have two simple questions.

1369
01:50:13,991 --> 01:50:16,991
I would like two simple, concrete answers.

1370
01:50:18,132 --> 01:50:24,453
Through the chair, for the director, how many feet above sea level is the Karatek Bridge?

1371
01:50:26,133 --> 01:50:33,194
And the second question, how many feet above sea level is the Amelia Earhart Dam at the Tippity Top?

1372
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:34,835
Two simple questions.

1373
01:50:35,815 --> 01:50:37,215
Were you able to answer that question, sir?

1374
01:50:39,458 --> 01:50:41,360
If the ice caps do come.

1375
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:47,004
No, I don't know the details of the sea level rise elevation.

1376
01:50:47,024 --> 01:50:51,207
I mean, that's information we could access very quickly, but on the top of my head, I don't know the answer to that.

1377
01:50:51,607 --> 01:50:52,108
I thank you, sir.

1378
01:50:52,128 --> 01:50:52,648
Thank you.

1379
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:53,609
On the motion by Councilor Nice.

1380
01:50:53,629 --> 01:50:55,931
Does paper be adopted?

1381
01:50:55,951 --> 01:50:57,652
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1382
01:51:08,393 --> 01:51:09,673
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1383
01:51:09,733 --> 01:51:19,397
Councilor DelaRusso?

1384
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:19,537
Yes.

1385
01:51:19,557 --> 01:51:21,978
Councilor Falco?

1386
01:51:22,178 --> 01:51:22,438
Yes.

1387
01:51:22,958 --> 01:51:23,459
Councilor Night?

1388
01:51:23,739 --> 01:51:24,139
Yes.

1389
01:51:24,559 --> 01:51:25,239
Councilor Kerr?

1390
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:25,339
Yes.

1391
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:27,040
Vice President Marks?

1392
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:27,640
Yes.

1393
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:28,981
Councilor Scarpelli?

1394
01:51:29,121 --> 01:51:29,621
Yes.

1395
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:31,541
President Caviello?

1396
01:51:31,802 --> 01:51:32,062
Yes.

1397
01:51:32,562 --> 01:51:33,742
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1398
01:51:36,962 --> 01:51:38,543
The proposal is adopted.

1399
01:51:39,564 --> 01:51:45,048
Motion by Councilor Langel-Kern that we revert back to regular business.

1400
01:51:45,068 --> 01:51:52,914
17-445 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the subdivision plan for Macklin Road.

1401
01:51:55,616 --> 01:51:56,097
Oh, I'm sorry.

1402
01:51:57,581 --> 01:52:11,925
17-448, offered by Councilor Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Office of Energy and Environment and the Conservation Commission update the City Council with any potential concerns regarding the proposed Macklin Road development.

1403
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:13,225
Councilor Longo Kern.

1404
01:52:15,626 --> 01:52:16,726
If you'd like to combine 448 and 445, Mr. Clerk.

1405
01:52:22,572 --> 01:52:32,959
17-445 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the subdivision plan for Macklin Road in the site plan review for 252 Main Street be discussed.

1406
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:34,501
Councilor Langel-Kern.

1407
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,862
Thank you, President Carviello.

1408
01:52:36,882 --> 01:52:46,189
I put this on last week after a few concerned residents had filled me in on what was going on down at Macklin Road.

1409
01:52:46,309 --> 01:52:50,172
It looks like there's a potential subdivision that was

1410
01:52:50,658 --> 01:53:03,741
put forth before the Office of Community Development site plan review last Wednesday, and is before, I believe, the Conservation Commission within the next couple days tomorrow.

1411
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:07,542
Tomorrow, in front of the Conservation Commission.

1412
01:53:09,342 --> 01:53:11,242
Right, 6.30 tomorrow.

1413
01:53:11,382 --> 01:53:17,624
So my concern, obviously, we've been involved in a number of different developments.

1414
01:53:17,644 --> 01:53:18,604
We've had a lot going on.

1415
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:28,131
A bunch of us have tried to go to a number of meetings, whether it be ZBA or OCD, Office of Community Development, private meetings.

1416
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:41,697
This one, I wasn't able to attend last Wednesday, but I do know that the residents have extreme concerns with regards to this being near, close to a conservation buffer, as well as potential flooding in the area.

1417
01:53:41,817 --> 01:53:43,958
I know this abuts McCormick Ave.

1418
01:53:44,577 --> 01:53:51,880
And there are residents on McCormick Ave that are very concerned that they're going to experience additional flooding on their road.

1419
01:53:53,080 --> 01:54:01,263
So if we could just get an update from the Conservation Commission with any potential concerns they have.

1420
01:54:01,403 --> 01:54:13,007
I know they're going to meet tomorrow night, but hopefully not only get an update from them, but let them know that the Metro City Council, if we could amend the paper, is very concerned, is interested in the residents concerned,

1421
01:54:13,484 --> 01:54:18,347
concerns with regards to the flooding and the conservation buffer zone.

1422
01:54:18,427 --> 01:54:31,435
So if we could let them know we are concerned and get an update with regards to what needs to be done if this is a project that can go forward, cannot go forward, why not?

1423
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:36,538
I believe it's three homes that are going to create a potential cul-de-sac in the area.

1424
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:38,900
And I do have, I mean, I live up in the Heights.

1425
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:44,882
I am concerned for my neighbors with regards to any, nobody wants any flooding in their home.

1426
01:54:44,922 --> 01:54:50,623
And if this is going to create that, we want to make sure we either do it in the right way or prevent it from happening.

1427
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:55,265
So if we could get some answers, that would be beneficial to the area.

1428
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:55,965
Thank you.

1429
01:54:57,205 --> 01:54:57,605
Thank you.

1430
01:54:57,705 --> 01:54:59,826
Counsel Longo, current counselor marks.

1431
01:55:02,193 --> 01:55:03,154
Thank you, Mr. President.

1432
01:55:03,534 --> 01:55:08,197
I had the opportunity to attend the meeting last Wednesday before the Community Development Board.

1433
01:55:09,058 --> 01:55:19,704
And on Macklin Road, there were a number of residents, as Council Member Curran mentioned, the proposal is to build three new homes on an area that abuts wetlands.

1434
01:55:20,585 --> 01:55:31,372
And I guess the Conservation Commission tomorrow night will be addressing whether or not the particular wetlands up there are active wetlands.

1435
01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:37,612
And that determination, I guess, will have a big impact whether or not this project moves forward.

1436
01:55:38,132 --> 01:55:51,917
But the neighborhood, Mr. President, as Councilor Longo-Kern mentioned, the project itself is in an area that is nestled between protected wetlands and homes towards the back.

1437
01:55:52,857 --> 01:55:56,619
The proposed homes are elevated higher than the homes behind them.

1438
01:55:57,099 --> 01:56:00,120
So the residents were concerned that there would be

1439
01:56:00,539 --> 01:56:15,907
a fair amount of runoff water into the yard in an area that I mentioned earlier when we were talking about the hazard mitigation plan, that there are residents up there that have sump pumps that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1440
01:56:16,227 --> 01:56:17,288
They never shut off.

1441
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:20,570
That's how much groundwater is in that particular area.

1442
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:22,651
And it's the fact that

1443
01:56:22,991 --> 01:56:42,544
There's poor drainage, Mr. President, but there's also the Cranberry Brook up there, which is an open brook that's been up there for many, many years, and I guess takes runoff water from a lot of the surrounding area and possibly even some of the local rivers, Mr. President.

1444
01:56:43,205 --> 01:56:46,627
A second concern was regarding water pressure.

1445
01:56:47,327 --> 01:56:50,990
And I've been on this council a number of years, and I can tell you firsthand that

1446
01:56:51,614 --> 01:56:55,919
When you hear water pressure, it's synonymous with North Medford and the Heights.

1447
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:57,821
Poor water pressure.

1448
01:56:57,861 --> 01:57:02,186
If someone next door is washing their car, the gentleman can't take a shower.

1449
01:57:02,547 --> 01:57:06,191
That's how poor the pressure is, Mr. President, in that particular area.

1450
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:13,256
Residents, although it's only three homes, have the right to request and say, what's going to happen with our water pressure?

1451
01:57:13,556 --> 01:57:15,197
It's already low as is.

1452
01:57:15,618 --> 01:57:18,900
What is going to be the case with new development in the area?

1453
01:57:19,841 --> 01:57:24,766
Some several years back, we put a new pump to improve pressure at the bottom of Fulton Street.

1454
01:57:25,386 --> 01:57:29,870
And that has done some help in providing additional water pressure.

1455
01:57:30,392 --> 01:57:36,138
But towards the top of the heights, I don't think it's alleviated any concerns that residents have.

1456
01:57:36,839 --> 01:57:46,088
Also, based on the plane of these homes, they're going to have to have a pump that pumps their sewage from the house to the city of Meffitt sewer line.

1457
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:51,454
Because of the angle, it doesn't flow as it should flow.

1458
01:57:52,819 --> 01:58:01,670
They're going to create these storage containers under the ground, giant sewage storage containers for these three homes.

1459
01:58:02,291 --> 01:58:11,162
They're made out of cement and they work like, you know, if sewage is going into them, there's a pump that sends it back out to

1460
01:58:11,604 --> 01:58:12,285
the sewage pipe.

1461
01:58:12,626 --> 01:58:18,675
However, because of power outages, they're equipped only to handle up to 24 hours.

1462
01:58:19,296 --> 01:58:22,220
So if you happen to have a power outage, Mr. President, that's over 24 hours.

1463
01:58:23,495 --> 01:58:24,156
And that happens.

1464
01:58:24,416 --> 01:58:27,397
I mean, it happens quite frequently in areas of our community.

1465
01:58:28,078 --> 01:58:33,021
These sewage container systems aren't equipped to accommodate the sewage that's going to be going into them.

1466
01:58:33,681 --> 01:58:36,223
And that poses another concern that residents had.

1467
01:58:36,603 --> 01:58:37,483
Well, how will it back up?

1468
01:58:37,503 --> 01:58:38,924
Will it back up into the new homes?

1469
01:58:38,984 --> 01:58:43,487
Or will it end up going up the pipe and possibly backing into our homes?

1470
01:58:43,827 --> 01:58:47,649
And that was another question that was asked regarding the sewage.

1471
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:50,411
The snow removal.

1472
01:58:50,751 --> 01:58:51,772
This is a private road.

1473
01:58:52,438 --> 01:58:54,700
Who's responsible ultimately for the snow removal?

1474
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,761
And where is the snow going to be put?

1475
01:58:57,142 --> 01:58:58,803
Is it going to be put back on the city street?

1476
01:58:59,183 --> 01:59:00,724
Is it going to be put towards wetlands?

1477
01:59:00,784 --> 01:59:06,549
And as we all know, you can't put snow because of salt and other debris near any type of wetlands.

1478
01:59:07,529 --> 01:59:08,930
That's a concern, Mr. President.

1479
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:11,232
And the ownership of the water pipes.

1480
01:59:12,033 --> 01:59:17,457
Where this is a private road, I believe the developer is responsible for the ownership of the water pipes.

1481
01:59:18,017 --> 01:59:22,942
But those pipes are going to lead 100, 150 feet, 200 feet.

1482
01:59:23,983 --> 01:59:27,206
And if one breaks during the night, who's responsible?

1483
01:59:27,506 --> 01:59:28,847
It's not the city's water pipes.

1484
01:59:29,488 --> 01:59:31,069
It's leading to the city's water pipes.

1485
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:35,733
So there are a number of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President.

1486
01:59:36,314 --> 01:59:38,356
And just so you know, these are three lots.

1487
01:59:38,816 --> 01:59:41,218
There's also another, from what I understand, 14 other.

1488
01:59:42,603 --> 01:59:44,684
non-buildable lots as it stands right now.

1489
01:59:45,084 --> 01:59:46,965
Some are undersized.

1490
01:59:47,445 --> 01:59:52,327
And that will be the next step, I can almost guarantee you, if these homes go in.

1491
01:59:53,048 --> 01:59:55,789
The second point I wanted to bring up was 252 Main Street.

1492
01:59:56,489 --> 01:59:57,970
It's currently a multi-family home.

1493
01:59:58,030 --> 02:00:00,011
I believe it's a two or three family home.

1494
02:00:01,671 --> 02:00:09,315
It's right on Main Street, not right around the corner from, which street is it?

1495
02:00:10,357 --> 02:00:12,558
Hancock Street, correct, thank you.

1496
02:00:13,539 --> 02:00:27,365
And they're taking a two or three family home, and they're trying to create nine units, like they did a couple doors down in that blue monstrosity that I referred to it as, that doesn't fit into the neighborhood.

1497
02:00:27,785 --> 02:00:35,389
It just so happens they're gonna be looking for a variance, because they're three spots shy of the variance for parking.

1498
02:00:36,069 --> 02:00:37,970
And as we know, that's already a congested area,

1499
02:00:38,521 --> 02:00:40,522
It's already on Main Street where you can't park.

1500
02:00:41,223 --> 02:00:47,747
And what will be happening, even though they're saying, it's all you hear now at these meetings, the millennials are moving in there.

1501
02:00:48,067 --> 02:00:48,888
It's like Paul Revere.

1502
02:00:49,088 --> 02:00:50,008
The millennials are coming.

1503
02:00:50,028 --> 02:00:50,809
The millennials are coming.

1504
02:00:51,409 --> 02:00:52,810
And, oh, they won't have cars.

1505
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:53,751
They'll never have families.

1506
02:00:53,771 --> 02:00:54,531
They'll never have kids.

1507
02:00:55,312 --> 02:00:57,793
I don't know how you can state that, Mr. President.

1508
02:00:58,134 --> 02:01:01,436
It sounds good when you make a presentation, I guess, to get what you want.

1509
02:01:01,976 --> 02:01:03,417
But it's not reality.

1510
02:01:04,017 --> 02:01:04,858
And in my opinion,

1511
02:01:05,314 --> 02:01:14,920
If you don't conform to current ordinances right now, in particular parking and height restrictions, which seem to be the major catching point, I don't think your project should move forward.

1512
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:18,562
And that's the way I feel about 252 High Street, Mr. President.

1513
02:01:19,763 --> 02:01:24,726
And so I'm looking forward to see what happens with both of these projects.

1514
02:01:25,306 --> 02:01:29,529
And I hope that the neighborhood on both Macklin

1515
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:33,373
and 252 Main Street and South Method are looped into this.

1516
02:01:33,853 --> 02:01:37,716
So there's plenty of neighborhood input and feedback, Mr. President.

1517
02:01:37,897 --> 02:01:39,578
And what day is this meeting, Mr. Vice President?

1518
02:01:39,818 --> 02:01:42,280
I believe it's tomorrow, the Conservation Commission meeting at 630.

1519
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:42,280
630?

1520
02:01:43,261 --> 02:01:44,762
I believe tomorrow.

1521
02:01:45,363 --> 02:01:52,929
And they're going to talk about at least Macklin on the wetlands up there, whether they're active or slightly active.

1522
02:01:53,129 --> 02:01:57,132
I don't know the exact terminology, but that's what they're going to decide, Mr. President.

1523
02:01:57,393 --> 02:01:57,693
Thank you.

1524
02:01:59,225 --> 02:01:59,885
Councilor Falco.

1525
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:01,066
Thank you, Mr. President.

1526
02:02:01,086 --> 02:02:04,648
I want to thank my council colleagues for bringing these resolutions forward tonight.

1527
02:02:04,668 --> 02:02:09,371
Uh, I've been called a number of times with regard to the, uh, Macklin road, uh, development.

1528
02:02:09,671 --> 02:02:17,035
And, um, I had the opportunity to, uh, to attend the, uh, the conservation commission meeting along with you actually on April 19th.

1529
02:02:17,676 --> 02:02:21,918
And, uh, it was at the, uh, community development board meeting last week with council of marks.

1530
02:02:21,938 --> 02:02:22,959
I had to leave a little bit early.

1531
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:25,200
My son had a band concert, but, um,

1532
02:02:26,163 --> 02:02:38,050
the residents in this neighborhood, uh, up in the Macklin road area have really rallied behind this to, uh, see what they can do, um, to, to, you know, hopefully prevent or at least make this small than it is.

1533
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:46,114
I mean, my colleagues mentioned tonight, there are a lot of concerns with regard to, uh, what putting in three new homes you're going to bring to this neighborhood.

1534
02:02:46,855 --> 02:02:52,238
Uh, you go down McCormick, have you drive down McCormick have tonight, you will see hoses coming out of the basements of these homes.

1535
02:02:52,826 --> 02:02:54,967
And they are constantly pumping water out.

1536
02:02:55,507 --> 02:02:57,367
The sub pumps are going nonstop.

1537
02:02:57,707 --> 02:02:59,308
And no one should have to live like this.

1538
02:02:59,628 --> 02:03:04,909
And I think by putting in three new homes, it's completely going to exasperate the situation.

1539
02:03:05,369 --> 02:03:16,392
So I think that we really have to take the city or the Conservation Commission and the Community Development Board really have to take this under consideration when looking at a development like this.

1540
02:03:16,412 --> 02:03:20,713
So major flooding is a concern.

1541
02:03:22,655 --> 02:03:26,797
You know, I think disrupting the ground in that area, I mean, you know, you're near a brook.

1542
02:03:26,817 --> 02:03:28,839
I mean, that's completely unknown what's going to happen.

1543
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:30,500
The water has to flow somewhere.

1544
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,301
So this is a concern as well.

1545
02:03:33,181 --> 02:03:36,083
You know, Council Marks mentioned that water pressure in that area.

1546
02:03:36,103 --> 02:03:41,326
A lot of friends that live up there in, you know, water pressure is tough, tough on that street in particular.

1547
02:03:42,006 --> 02:03:48,310
You know, someone called me and said, you know, I can't, you know, take a shower and have someone flush the toilet at the same time or else the water,

1548
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:50,091
completely shuts down almost.

1549
02:03:50,151 --> 02:03:51,631
So, I mean, that's a concern.

1550
02:03:51,671 --> 02:03:58,955
You go to environmental issues, you take a look, this developer has already cut down one tree within the buffer zone.

1551
02:03:59,875 --> 02:04:04,177
And that's completely blatant disrespect to our ordinances.

1552
02:04:04,317 --> 02:04:05,338
I mean, that's completely wrong.

1553
02:04:05,998 --> 02:04:14,922
And so, you know, I mean, I think, you know, when they're cutting down trees in a buffer zone, you know, right away that should send up red flags, you know,

1554
02:04:15,946 --> 02:04:20,250
Like my colleagues mentioned, they're proposing three homes on this cul-de-sac.

1555
02:04:20,871 --> 02:04:24,093
And one of the homes is within the wetlands buffer zone.

1556
02:04:25,014 --> 02:04:31,260
And I think we have to be really careful here as a city, because if you're going to allow something like this, you're setting precedent for future development.

1557
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:36,144
You're setting precedent for other homes in other wetland-type areas.

1558
02:04:36,344 --> 02:04:37,385
We need to watch out there.

1559
02:04:38,225 --> 02:04:40,367
It's completely wrong, I think.

1560
02:04:40,948 --> 02:04:43,450
Kudos to the citizens, really, for stepping up.

1561
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:49,793
But I think there was probably 60 to 70, 75 people at the Conservation Commission meeting.

1562
02:04:50,474 --> 02:04:52,234
There were a lot of residents here last week.

1563
02:04:52,255 --> 02:04:56,737
And I give them a lot of credit, because both of those meetings have been continued.

1564
02:04:56,797 --> 02:04:59,298
So it's meeting after meeting, week after week.

1565
02:04:59,378 --> 02:05:04,781
So I really applaud your tenacity of going after this and staying on top of it.

1566
02:05:05,081 --> 02:05:06,202
And I think that's important.

1567
02:05:07,443 --> 02:05:10,184
But really, there's a lot of concerns.

1568
02:05:12,632 --> 02:05:14,393
You're trying to think out of the box here a little bit.

1569
02:05:15,294 --> 02:05:19,337
You mentioned Council Marks, how there's 14 other lots that are unbuildable.

1570
02:05:20,377 --> 02:05:24,000
And everyone's trying to come here and build.

1571
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:27,803
But I mean, we take a look at the CPA and how we passed that.

1572
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:31,192
The community passed that last year.

1573
02:05:31,853 --> 02:05:38,778
I know the CPA here is in its infancy, but this is something that really, you talk about open space and stuff like that.

1574
02:05:39,159 --> 02:05:44,743
This is something that probably could be considered, that the city could maybe purchase at some point in time.

1575
02:05:44,783 --> 02:05:51,829
And I'm not saying one of the first projects, but maybe down the line they could purchase this in a place of conservation restriction on the property.

1576
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:54,011
So you can't build on it in the future.

1577
02:05:54,428 --> 02:05:56,670
And I think that's, you know, these are things that we need to look at.

1578
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:59,832
But, you know, I did promise a resident tonight.

1579
02:06:01,833 --> 02:06:13,462
It's really been on top of the situation since, you know, there's a resident up on McCormick Ave, Will Humphreys, nice guy, and he's been on top of this since this came about, this whole issue.

1580
02:06:13,942 --> 02:06:15,883
And he said, you know, he couldn't make it to the meeting tonight.

1581
02:06:16,504 --> 02:06:20,307
And like I said, I mean, these residents have been going to meetings nonstop.

1582
02:06:20,962 --> 02:06:22,383
And he said, can you please read a letter for me?

1583
02:06:22,403 --> 02:06:23,364
And I said, absolutely.

1584
02:06:23,424 --> 02:06:29,988
I mean, if he's going to be here tomorrow night, then he's going to be at a meeting next week, whenever the Conservation Commission meets.

1585
02:06:30,889 --> 02:06:31,709
I said, no problem.

1586
02:06:31,729 --> 02:06:32,950
I'll read the letter for you.

1587
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:34,991
And I'll submit this into the public record.

1588
02:06:35,011 --> 02:06:37,753
I'll make a copy for you, Mr. Finn.

1589
02:06:38,454 --> 02:06:46,559
To whom it may concern, I'm ready to ask Method elected representatives, commissions, and boards to listen to its citizens when considering this development.

1590
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:50,502
Thank you to the Environment Department and Conservation Commission.

1591
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:58,713
in the Community Development Office and Board, the City Engineer, the City Council, and the ongoing attention to the many problems with this subdivision proposal.

1592
02:06:59,314 --> 02:07:07,217
The community that surrounds this development is speaking out with a unified voice of concern and opposition.

1593
02:07:07,897 --> 02:07:10,639
Many citizens attended meetings on the proposal.

1594
02:07:11,219 --> 02:07:17,782
Concerns expressed include loss of storm and flood water retention capacity, increased

1595
02:07:18,658 --> 02:07:21,821
throughput to sewer and water systems that are already strained.

1596
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:25,324
Damage to existing homes and extensive blasting of ledge.

1597
02:07:25,844 --> 02:07:29,987
Loss of aesthetically pleasing natural green space.

1598
02:07:30,588 --> 02:07:33,590
Wildlife habitat destruction and damage to wetlands.

1599
02:07:34,451 --> 02:07:36,813
Increased traffic near Carr Park and the Tot Lot.

1600
02:07:37,503 --> 02:07:49,747
Access Issues and Disturbance to Direct the Butter on Macklin Road were a non-profit organization that provides services to several long-time residents with developmental disabilities at the home.

1601
02:07:51,247 --> 02:08:00,310
He also goes on to say that he included a petition of 115 Medford residents, representing much of the surrounding neighborhood, echoing these same concerns.

1602
02:08:02,482 --> 02:08:05,123
in its current state is of great value to the community.

1603
02:08:05,663 --> 02:08:11,205
This is the opposite of an abandoned building in need of improvement or environmental cleanup.

1604
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:14,626
The surrounding neighborhood is unified in opposition to the proposal.

1605
02:08:15,086 --> 02:08:18,527
No public benefit is served through development of the subdivision.

1606
02:08:19,147 --> 02:08:26,710
Medford's assessors has long considered 13 of the 14 lots as undevelopable when assessing their value.

1607
02:08:27,452 --> 02:08:36,760
Therefore, the city should not grant any waivers or variances to existing regulations around roadways, setbacks, zoning, and building codes, or environmental protections.

1608
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:41,824
Those regulations exist to protect our city, its citizens, and its ecosystems.

1609
02:08:42,604 --> 02:08:46,467
If the regulations can't be adhered to, then the land should not be developed upon.

1610
02:08:46,507 --> 02:08:47,628
Sincerely, Will Humphreys.

1611
02:08:48,409 --> 02:08:49,990
So I just wanted to read that on his behalf.

1612
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:52,752
Like I said, I will print out a copy of that letter.

1613
02:08:52,812 --> 02:08:54,594
But I think, you know, one of the,

1614
02:08:55,585 --> 02:09:01,467
things just to conclude on is that, you know, this is a unique piece of land in our community.

1615
02:09:02,047 --> 02:09:09,590
Um, you know, it's, it's one of the few remaining areas within the city of Medford that has, you know, woodland habitat and you know, we really need to preserve this.

1616
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:14,172
So I just wanted to go on the record and saying that I thank my colleagues for bringing this up for tonight.

1617
02:09:14,372 --> 02:09:14,692
Thank you.

1618
02:09:14,712 --> 02:09:14,992
Thank you.

1619
02:09:15,012 --> 02:09:15,652
Counselor Falco.

1620
02:09:17,913 --> 02:09:19,234
Name and address of the record, please.

1621
02:09:19,354 --> 02:09:22,515
I'm an culture era and my address is 17 McCormick Gav.

1622
02:09:23,527 --> 02:09:26,089
And I'm here to speak against the development.

1623
02:09:26,349 --> 02:09:29,010
I directly abut the property being developed.

1624
02:09:29,851 --> 02:09:32,112
And I've lived there for over 20 years.

1625
02:09:32,232 --> 02:09:37,235
My husband has lived there and his family on that street since the 1950s.

1626
02:09:38,116 --> 02:09:46,961
And we, as has been stated, have had lots of problems with water pressure, with flooding.

1627
02:09:49,003 --> 02:09:52,745
And we are concerned that this is going to add to that.

1628
02:09:53,202 --> 02:09:54,063
to those problems.

1629
02:09:55,904 --> 02:09:57,085
So that's a big concern.

1630
02:09:57,545 --> 02:10:01,168
We also feel that it's detrimental to the neighborhood.

1631
02:10:01,188 --> 02:10:05,612
A lot of people have moved into the neighborhood because we have some green space.

1632
02:10:06,392 --> 02:10:07,994
There isn't much in Medford.

1633
02:10:09,255 --> 02:10:22,145
And we're also concerned about added traffic to the area because it's a very tight, where Winslow goes into Tamor, you know, it cuts off and there's a lot of kids coming that way.

1634
02:10:22,689 --> 02:10:28,113
on bicycles going to car park and so forth, and the group home on the corner.

1635
02:10:28,773 --> 02:10:33,436
So we feel that this is a dead end road.

1636
02:10:34,998 --> 02:10:44,844
And people on Tamor have also expressed that the wetland, they're concerned that it's going to exasperate the problems they have with wetlands behind them as well.

1637
02:10:45,885 --> 02:10:51,649
So the concern that one wetland sort of feeds into another, and as has been said,

1638
02:10:52,659 --> 02:10:53,780
the water has to go somewhere.

1639
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:59,485
Uh, so we're, we're glad that you're, uh, reviewing this proposal.

1640
02:11:00,185 --> 02:11:09,152
Um, the neighborhood has been very united, uh, against this development and we hope that it does not go forward.

1641
02:11:09,553 --> 02:11:10,153
So thank you.

1642
02:11:10,513 --> 02:11:10,774
Thank you.

1643
02:11:10,794 --> 02:11:11,374
Mr. Coltrane.

1644
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,637
Any address to the record, please.

1645
02:11:16,258 --> 02:11:19,841
My name is Jen Young and I live at 72 McCormick Ave in Medford.

1646
02:11:20,521 --> 02:11:20,922
And, um,

1647
02:11:22,411 --> 02:11:30,273
My husband and I actually bought our home from the Coltreras 13 years ago, and we live just down the street from them now.

1648
02:11:30,913 --> 02:11:37,555
And one of the reasons that we chose to move to Medford and to this area of Medford was because of that green space.

1649
02:11:37,675 --> 02:11:48,977
We decided when we saw the house on a dead-end street, and we could imagine our kids riding their bikes down the street, which they do now, and then that we can see trees and we can see green space.

1650
02:11:49,137 --> 02:11:51,778
And I think one of the things that

1651
02:11:52,346 --> 02:12:07,854
surprised us when we moved in was in the late winter seeing this sort of path going through our backyard across the street into this area that we're talking about, which has become a real kind of wildlife sort of pathway coming from the fells.

1652
02:12:08,494 --> 02:12:16,698
And I think kind of building in that area or even next to that area really limits the wildlife area in Medford.

1653
02:12:16,878 --> 02:12:21,000
And I think it's really important to keep the green space that we do have.

1654
02:12:21,721 --> 02:12:21,941
Thanks.

1655
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:22,920
Thank you.

1656
02:12:25,562 --> 02:12:29,445
On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by Vice President Mox.

1657
02:12:33,047 --> 02:12:33,688
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1658
02:12:33,848 --> 02:12:38,851
Through the Chair, thank you, President Carviello, because I couldn't make the Wednesday night meeting.

1659
02:12:38,971 --> 02:12:43,234
Do you know what the final, does anybody know what the final vote was for the site plan review?

1660
02:12:46,656 --> 02:12:47,577
Councilor Falco, if you can.

1661
02:12:48,218 --> 02:12:52,941
From what I've been told, they've been more questions than answers.

1662
02:12:53,081 --> 02:12:55,743
I guess the developer has not been really able to answer much.

1663
02:12:55,763 --> 02:12:56,964
No vote was taken.

1664
02:12:56,984 --> 02:12:57,765
So no vote was taken.

1665
02:12:57,785 --> 02:12:59,206
So no vote's been taken.

1666
02:12:59,286 --> 02:13:02,087
They have to go in front of the Conservation Commission again tomorrow night.

1667
02:13:02,268 --> 02:13:03,328
And then they're going again.

1668
02:13:03,348 --> 02:13:07,211
They're going in front of the Community Development Board again.

1669
02:13:07,231 --> 02:13:13,295
I don't know the date of that meeting, but there were a ton of questions from both commissions.

1670
02:13:13,815 --> 02:13:17,638
And the developer needs to get back to both boards

1671
02:13:18,475 --> 02:13:19,776
with the answers to those questions.

1672
02:13:19,856 --> 02:13:21,096
So thank you.

1673
02:13:26,459 --> 02:13:27,159
Thank you.

1674
02:13:27,219 --> 02:13:27,499
Thank you.

1675
02:13:28,139 --> 02:13:38,664
Um, and with regards to tomorrow night's meeting, I mean, it sounds like there update notice of intent regarding the creation of the subdivision on Macklin road in Medford.

1676
02:13:39,203 --> 02:13:43,165
with one proposed lot, so does anybody know exactly what tomorrow night will be?

1677
02:13:43,185 --> 02:13:45,166
Will it be question and answer?

1678
02:13:45,266 --> 02:13:46,787
Will the public be able to speak?

1679
02:13:47,127 --> 02:13:49,829
I just don't know if my colleagues know the answer to that either.

1680
02:13:50,529 --> 02:13:52,270
I would assume everyone will be able to speak tomorrow evening.

1681
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:55,492
They didn't say that there would be any restrictions.

1682
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:03,011
I'm under the same impression that everyone's going to be able to speak.

1683
02:14:03,071 --> 02:14:09,572
And hopefully, the developer will have answers to the questions that the commission had.

1684
02:14:09,772 --> 02:14:13,173
Because they had, I think, a laundry list of questions that needed to be answered.

1685
02:14:13,253 --> 02:14:16,434
And I believe that the Conservation Commission was actually going.

1686
02:14:16,514 --> 02:14:18,074
They had done one site visit.

1687
02:14:18,574 --> 02:14:29,137
And I think they were going to do, or at least there was one member that actually wanted to go out and look at the wetlands, I think, to actually physically see the space.

1688
02:14:30,455 --> 02:14:30,836
That's good to know.

1689
02:14:30,856 --> 02:14:31,156
Thank you.

1690
02:14:31,416 --> 02:14:31,737
Thank you.

1691
02:14:32,197 --> 02:14:33,038
Vice President Mox.

1692
02:14:38,585 --> 02:14:39,507
Thank you, Mr. President.

1693
02:14:39,747 --> 02:14:47,537
I believe also last Wednesday there were many issues, as Councilor Falco mentioned, that were not answered.

1694
02:14:47,955 --> 02:15:00,621
Although the city engineer was in attendance and many of them were directed to her, the committee requested that, the community development board requested that the city engineer sit down with the developer.

1695
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:05,243
So I think in between these other meetings that have taken place with the conservation committee,

1696
02:15:05,995 --> 02:15:13,099
commission that the city engineer is going to meet to discuss ownership of pipes and other issues that deal with engineering.

1697
02:15:13,519 --> 02:15:14,840
So I think that's the first point.

1698
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:33,529
The second point, Mr. President, is we heard tonight, and that's why I mentioned to the board that came before us for emergency preparedness, is that, you know, year after year, the city recommends that we attend to certain areas that are prone to flooding.

1699
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:36,550
And the Heights is listed all the time, Salt Method.

1700
02:15:36,831 --> 02:15:40,554
There's a number of hotspots that this community is aware of for years.

1701
02:15:41,295 --> 02:15:49,683
And there are steps that we can take for a very minimal amount of money to help alleviate some of the concerns that we're hearing.

1702
02:15:50,544 --> 02:15:53,787
Back several years ago, I met with residents on McCormick Ave.

1703
02:15:54,227 --> 02:15:58,250
that were concerned that just a simple issue of how the street is sloped.

1704
02:15:58,731 --> 02:16:09,079
You know, people were building up their driveway because the street was sloped so the water wouldn't pour into catch basins, but pour into people's driveways, which eventually ends up in their basement.

1705
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:16,165
And these were simple things that, you know, grinding of a street and repositioning and re-angling a street

1706
02:16:16,555 --> 02:16:19,937
So it pours into a catch basin and not into people's driveways.

1707
02:16:20,457 --> 02:16:29,302
But there were people's driveways that were up literally five to six inches above the street because they were so sick of having water pour into their driveway.

1708
02:16:30,023 --> 02:16:33,385
But these are the type of fixes, Mr. President, that with $7.5 million of money

1709
02:16:36,002 --> 02:16:47,832
that's out there with the water and sewer enterprise account that we should be looking at, Mr. President, and, you know, not relying on residents to pump out their basement 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1710
02:16:49,013 --> 02:16:52,937
So I would also ask, Mr. President, that the city administration

1711
02:16:53,576 --> 02:16:56,678
look into McCormick Ave regarding the slope and the pitch.

1712
02:16:57,578 --> 02:16:58,959
This was back several years ago.

1713
02:16:58,979 --> 02:17:10,544
I'm sure the city didn't go out there and grind the whole street and probably angle the street, but I would ask that that be taken care of now by the city engineer.

1714
02:17:10,884 --> 02:17:11,224
Thank you.

1715
02:17:12,225 --> 02:17:12,745
Councilor Knight.

1716
02:17:14,436 --> 02:17:16,176
So what is it we're voting on, Mr. President?

1717
02:17:16,196 --> 02:17:25,098
We're going to be asking the Office of Energy and the Environment to, and the Conservation Commission, to report back to us with any potential concerns regarding the Macklin Road development.

1718
02:17:25,158 --> 02:17:28,558
And we're asking for an engineering study on McCormick Avenue relative to slope and pitch.

1719
02:17:28,598 --> 02:17:29,419
Is that what we're voting on?

1720
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:30,139
That is correct, Councilor Knight.

1721
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:31,679
Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

1722
02:17:33,819 --> 02:17:36,840
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococoon.

1723
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:37,620
All those in favor?

1724
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:37,700
Aye.

1725
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:41,301
Motion passes.

1726
02:17:41,321 --> 02:17:43,561
17446, offered by Vice President Marks.

1727
02:17:44,413 --> 02:17:51,299
Be it resolved that the City Council receive an updated list of tree stumps and sidewalk repairs.

1728
02:17:51,759 --> 02:17:52,800
Vice President Marks.

1729
02:17:53,641 --> 02:17:54,601
Thank you, Mr. President.

1730
02:17:54,982 --> 02:17:57,324
I hate to put this on the agenda again, but guess what?

1731
02:17:58,144 --> 02:17:59,485
I'm going to put it on the agenda again.

1732
02:18:00,226 --> 02:18:01,547
It was several weeks back.

1733
02:18:01,707 --> 02:18:03,469
I offered a resolution asking for an update.

1734
02:18:03,529 --> 02:18:09,313
I think it was amended by several councilors to get an update of a sidewalk and, um,

1735
02:18:10,648 --> 02:18:12,469
street repair and stumps.

1736
02:18:13,189 --> 02:18:15,730
And to date, I don't recall receiving anything.

1737
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:21,773
I don't know if my fellow colleagues, sometimes it may skip a packet, but I didn't receive anything, Mr. President.

1738
02:18:22,374 --> 02:18:33,879
And I could just tell you firsthand that the calls I'm receiving regarding stump removal, I must be the king of stump removal because I keep on receiving call after call from people in this community.

1739
02:18:34,419 --> 02:18:38,201
And they tell me when they call City Hall, they're being told they're on the list.

1740
02:18:39,498 --> 02:18:47,802
And I hate to laugh at people, but that list, I tell them, could be three, four, five, 10 years before your stump gets taken out, assuming you are on the list.

1741
02:18:48,822 --> 02:19:05,270
So once again, Mr. President, that I would ask, and I think Councilor Nights, the Chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee, I would ask that, like I did several weeks back regarding street sweeping, I think we have to put together, because there is no clear, in my opinion,

1742
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:08,692
There is no clear approach in this city.

1743
02:19:09,093 --> 02:19:20,622
I'm not aware of any rules or regulations administratively that require stumps to be removed within a certain time frame after the tree is taken down.

1744
02:19:21,222 --> 02:19:25,746
So once you have a public hearing to remove a tree, once the tree wardens out there determines

1745
02:19:26,072 --> 02:19:27,673
The tree's unsafe or it's unhealthy.

1746
02:19:27,993 --> 02:19:28,894
It needs to be removed.

1747
02:19:29,134 --> 02:19:31,635
There's a lengthy process that's governed by state law.

1748
02:19:32,396 --> 02:19:36,298
Then what happens on our end, Mr. President, there is no process.

1749
02:19:36,779 --> 02:19:50,087
So the tree will come down eventually, and the stump will remain for one, two, three, four, five years in front of someone's home that is paying taxes that have been increased the last 25 years, year after year, Mr. President.

1750
02:19:50,587 --> 02:20:00,318
So I would ask that the Public Works Subcommittee, I don't think they met on the other issue, I know Councilor Knight has his hands full with a lot of requests, that a city ordinance be created.

1751
02:20:00,338 --> 02:20:01,580
This would be my recommendation.

1752
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,322
The subcommittee could do whatever they want.

1753
02:20:03,682 --> 02:20:06,766
But within 30 days, Mr. President, of a tree removal,

1754
02:20:07,697 --> 02:20:17,664
that the stump should be taken down to the ground, Mr. President, and also the sidewalk repaired or a new tree planted, depending on the wish of the homeowner.

1755
02:20:18,124 --> 02:20:19,765
But there has to be a time frame.

1756
02:20:20,105 --> 02:20:32,013
We can't continue to operate this way, Mr. President, where residents are not sure they're on the list, they may be on the list, and looking at a stump, an unsightly stump in front of their home for many, many years.

1757
02:20:33,053 --> 02:20:34,895
Regarding the sidewalks, Mr. President,

1758
02:20:36,095 --> 02:20:55,465
The mayor is looking at right now a beautification process where $250,000 the mayor is putting out for each of the five business districts, so they would get $50,000 each, and looking to put out a survey in the community for business owners and residents to ask for beautification within the different business districts.

1759
02:20:56,105 --> 02:21:04,850
And the business owners that I've spoken to, John Pompeo and Wes Method and other business owners throughout the community, is that

1760
02:21:05,209 --> 02:21:13,891
They're more concerned about the basic issues of cracked sidewalks, Mr. President, the lack of signage within different business districts.

1761
02:21:15,071 --> 02:21:17,032
That's what they're concerned about, Mr. President.

1762
02:21:17,632 --> 02:21:25,453
And, you know, it's great to have this $50,000, and it's great to put it out there and get input from everyone, but they just want the basics.

1763
02:21:26,214 --> 02:21:27,834
And that's what they're explaining to me.

1764
02:21:29,035 --> 02:21:44,364
I just want to put in a plug, Mr. President, that I don't think we have to wait for a $250,000 offering from the mayor to have a survey go out to do the basic amenities to fix a sidewalk in front of a business owner's establishment, Mr. President.

1765
02:21:44,644 --> 02:21:50,527
I don't think we have to jump through six to eight months worth of hurdles to do basic, basic city improvements.

1766
02:21:51,062 --> 02:21:53,124
So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1767
02:21:53,444 --> 02:22:08,456
This be sent to the subcommittee on public works, and that an ordinance be created to put a timeframe on when a stump will be removed after tree removal, so residents don't have to wonder what's gonna happen, Mr. President, any longer.

1768
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:15,041
The public works subcommittee is Councilor Knight, Vice President Marks, and Councilor DelaRusso.

1769
02:22:15,721 --> 02:22:18,864
And that $250,000 has been sitting there for a couple of years now.

1770
02:22:20,542 --> 02:22:23,085
waiting for something to happen with it.

1771
02:22:23,145 --> 02:22:29,333
So that's not new money or found money that's been sitting there from the, I think, McGlynn's administration.

1772
02:22:29,453 --> 02:22:32,156
No, no, Mr. President, no, if I could.

1773
02:22:32,537 --> 02:22:36,742
If I'm not mistaken, that was money that Mayor McGlynn put aside.

1774
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:39,110
Right.

1775
02:22:39,611 --> 02:22:42,633
So the beautification or whatever they want to call it.

1776
02:22:42,653 --> 02:22:43,674
He put aside $250,000.

1777
02:22:44,134 --> 02:22:45,675
The mayor has changed it around now.

1778
02:22:45,695 --> 02:22:46,295
We have a new mayor.

1779
02:22:46,455 --> 02:22:46,716
Okay.

1780
02:22:46,976 --> 02:22:51,419
This mayor is going to request that the council vote $250,000 out of free cash.

1781
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:52,019
Additional.

1782
02:22:52,179 --> 02:22:53,900
Not additional.

1783
02:22:54,321 --> 02:22:54,961
Not additional.

1784
02:22:55,061 --> 02:22:57,683
It's $50,000 for each business district divided by $250,000.

1785
02:22:57,723 --> 02:22:59,764
That's five business districts.

1786
02:22:59,804 --> 02:23:03,067
So the mayor has changed it around and that's her authority.

1787
02:23:04,074 --> 02:23:06,375
Um, so she didn't follow through with the payment list.

1788
02:23:06,395 --> 02:23:10,395
We were using that money that was in that fund for a couple of years.

1789
02:23:11,836 --> 02:23:12,616
Not that I'm aware of.

1790
02:23:13,076 --> 02:23:13,756
Councilor Falco.

1791
02:23:14,576 --> 02:23:15,336
Thank you, Mr. President.

1792
02:23:15,476 --> 02:23:17,997
I just wanted to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1793
02:23:18,517 --> 02:23:19,897
Uh, this is a definite concern.

1794
02:23:20,177 --> 02:23:24,158
Um, you go through, uh, each neighbor, this dumps all over the place.

1795
02:23:24,358 --> 02:23:28,419
So I would definitely be in favor of a ordinance to, uh, to police this.

1796
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:30,740
Um, I think that it's long overdue.

1797
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:32,560
Um, you know, it's sad that,

1798
02:23:33,054 --> 02:23:37,115
When you have stumps out there year after year, they need to be addressed.

1799
02:23:37,555 --> 02:23:39,936
And they should be addressed right away.

1800
02:23:39,976 --> 02:23:40,916
To me, it's a safety issue.

1801
02:23:41,397 --> 02:23:42,617
You have kids walking down the street.

1802
02:23:42,637 --> 02:23:43,937
We're encouraging people to walk.

1803
02:23:45,098 --> 02:23:46,498
We have a complete streets program.

1804
02:23:47,158 --> 02:23:55,121
And you're encouraging people to get out there and walk, but you're forcing people into the street when there's stumps all over the place.

1805
02:23:55,161 --> 02:23:56,441
And I think it needs to be addressed.

1806
02:23:56,801 --> 02:23:58,322
I got a call from a resident the other day.

1807
02:23:58,342 --> 02:24:00,923
He has a tree on his sidewalk.

1808
02:24:00,983 --> 02:24:02,223
It's popping up the panel.

1809
02:24:02,737 --> 02:24:08,482
the curbs falling away from the, from the side is separating from the sidewalk and that needs to be addressed.

1810
02:24:08,742 --> 02:24:11,605
And you know, so we have issues like this all over our community.

1811
02:24:11,625 --> 02:24:13,026
It doesn't matter what neighborhood you're in.

1812
02:24:13,046 --> 02:24:14,407
Um, they're out there.

1813
02:24:14,527 --> 02:24:18,250
And, uh, so I'd be in full support of, uh, in ordinance to police this.

1814
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:19,171
I think it's a good idea.

1815
02:24:19,191 --> 02:24:23,395
And if you wouldn't mind me, uh, amending your resolution, if we could have, uh,

1816
02:24:25,682 --> 02:24:29,724
49 Bradshaw Street added to the list of sidewalk repair.

1817
02:24:30,084 --> 02:24:32,145
Just if the DPW could go out there and take a look.

1818
02:24:32,165 --> 02:24:36,866
Okay, we'll put on the next one then.

1819
02:24:46,528 --> 02:24:47,489
Vice President Box.

1820
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:55,641
Just if I could, Mr. President, this council over the years has asked National Grid regarding double polls, their polls in the city.

1821
02:24:56,763 --> 02:24:58,886
And we've required the state legislature.

1822
02:24:58,926 --> 02:25:02,592
We've asked them on countless times to create a state law

1823
02:25:03,302 --> 02:25:08,604
that would put a time frame on when National Grid can sit on these double poles, how long they can sit.

1824
02:25:09,004 --> 02:25:18,408
And it was back, I think, two or three years ago, the state legislature finally put together a law, a state law, that requires National Grid to address their double poles.

1825
02:25:19,068 --> 02:25:26,712
Here we are on the city side, Mr. President, where you may not have a double pole, but you may have a stump in front of your house for five years, and there's no requirement at all.

1826
02:25:27,372 --> 02:25:30,093
So there is no administrative policy that I'm aware of.

1827
02:25:30,713 --> 02:25:41,119
And the fact that the administration hasn't picked up on this over the last 20 years, I think requires the city ordinance to step in and require the city, Mr. President, to act on this.

1828
02:25:41,139 --> 02:25:41,459
Thank you.

1829
02:25:42,139 --> 02:25:44,841
I have a double pole in front of my house.

1830
02:25:45,301 --> 02:25:47,762
Mr. President, I wasn't done yet.

1831
02:25:48,383 --> 02:25:48,763
I'm sorry.

1832
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:50,724
I'm sorry, Councilor Falco.

1833
02:25:50,904 --> 02:25:59,549
So if I could have a B paper for the DPW to look at the sidewalk panel in front of, to actually the side, it's a corner lot, the corner of Honeywell and, uh,

1834
02:26:00,488 --> 02:26:03,510
Bradshaw, it's 49 Bradshaw Street.

1835
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:04,691
And if I could also add.

1836
02:26:05,192 --> 02:26:05,692
It's a B paper to 17446.

1837
02:26:05,732 --> 02:26:07,113
And if we could also have Bradshaw.

1838
02:26:30,734 --> 02:26:32,575
in Honeywell, it's the corner.

1839
02:26:33,776 --> 02:26:37,439
It's a raised sidewalk panel.

1840
02:26:37,479 --> 02:26:40,881
And you have another one, sir?

1841
02:26:41,221 --> 02:26:46,805
Yes, if we could have the DPW department or whatever utility is responsible for this.

1842
02:26:47,606 --> 02:26:53,930
There is not a half pole, not a double pole, it's a mini pole at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fulton Street.

1843
02:26:54,331 --> 02:26:56,032
It's gotta be about four feet off the ground.

1844
02:26:56,988 --> 02:26:58,108
Definite safety hazard.

1845
02:26:58,128 --> 02:26:59,609
I mean, there's kids all over the place there.

1846
02:27:00,169 --> 02:27:01,029
It's not a tree stump.

1847
02:27:01,049 --> 02:27:01,949
It's a telephone pole.

1848
02:27:02,029 --> 02:27:03,150
It used to be a double pole.

1849
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,610
Thank you.

1850
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:06,650
And then they cut it down and it's like a mini pole.

1851
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:07,110
Thank you.

1852
02:27:08,911 --> 02:27:09,271
Thank you.

1853
02:27:09,611 --> 02:27:10,471
Councilor Lundquist.

1854
02:27:10,851 --> 02:27:12,592
Thank you, President Carviello.

1855
02:27:12,632 --> 02:27:18,733
I actually have more to say about potholes, but I want to thank my colleague for putting this forward and I move approval.

1856
02:27:19,313 --> 02:27:19,653
Thank you.

1857
02:27:21,594 --> 02:27:22,194
Councilor Knight.

1858
02:27:22,634 --> 02:27:23,815
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1859
02:27:23,855 --> 02:27:25,255
I think it's important to point out that

1860
02:27:26,652 --> 02:27:27,992
Here in the city, we have two stump lists.

1861
02:27:28,333 --> 02:27:32,854
We have one stump list that the city is responsible for and one stump list that the public utility is responsible for.

1862
02:27:32,894 --> 02:27:38,816
And I think that Councilor Moxley is on the right track as part of the permitting process for our public utilities to come into the community to dig up our streets.

1863
02:27:39,356 --> 02:27:42,818
They should also be required to take down the stumps on the trees that they've taken down.

1864
02:27:42,878 --> 02:27:44,678
So I think that's a nice place to start.

1865
02:27:44,718 --> 02:27:47,359
It's certainly a good, a good intention.

1866
02:27:47,459 --> 02:27:49,680
And I think it's going to lead us in the right direction, Mr. President.

1867
02:27:50,605 --> 02:27:58,447
In terms of the $250,000 for our business district, I think that nothing can improve our business districts more than improving the flow of traffic and making them more pedestrian safe.

1868
02:27:58,947 --> 02:28:03,828
With that being said, I'm pretty sure that a traffic engineer will cost less than $250,000, Mr. President.

1869
02:28:04,268 --> 02:28:06,608
I'm sure we could probably get two years of a traffic engineer out of $250,000.

1870
02:28:06,748 --> 02:28:12,409
So with that being said, that would be a recommendation that I would like to make as an amendment to Councilor Falco's B paper.

1871
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:14,870
Also, Mr. President,

1872
02:28:17,602 --> 02:28:19,844
Did you get that?

1873
02:28:19,904 --> 02:28:20,284
Add a trap.

1874
02:28:20,304 --> 02:28:37,435
$250,000 be spent for a traffic engineer as opposed to business district beautification because ultimately if we improve the flow of traffic and we make our community more pedestrian friendly, we are going to be improving our business districts and we're going to be improving the quality of life of our city as a whole, not just in these five areas.

1875
02:28:37,455 --> 02:28:37,975
Mr. President.

1876
02:28:38,456 --> 02:28:40,077
Um, so with that being said, I move for approval.

1877
02:28:40,537 --> 02:28:40,897
Thank you.

1878
02:28:41,177 --> 02:28:41,958
Councilor Scott.

1879
02:28:42,318 --> 02:28:45,020
I yell to the gentleman who approached the podium.

1880
02:28:45,754 --> 02:28:46,815
Name and address of the record, please.

1881
02:28:46,995 --> 02:28:48,935
Paul Gucciati, 37 Dunin Street.

1882
02:28:49,396 --> 02:28:51,357
I just want to acknowledge the double poles.

1883
02:28:51,397 --> 02:28:55,518
We've had a double pole for more than five years in Dunin Street and I'll hit the potholes in a few minutes.

1884
02:28:58,720 --> 02:28:59,120
Thank you.

1885
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:00,020
Counselor Scott.

1886
02:29:00,201 --> 02:29:01,861
Again, I, I, and I'll hop on this.

1887
02:29:01,901 --> 02:29:13,386
I think that one of my, my biggest issues coming onto the council is the lack of respect from our public utilities, um, and replacing panels and still, that's still an issue.

1888
02:29:13,447 --> 02:29:14,427
So, um,

1889
02:29:15,263 --> 02:29:30,109
I'd like an update if we can, if we could med that to still ask the DPW if they can identify panels that haven't been replaced yet.

1890
02:29:31,369 --> 02:29:39,312
What I'm seeing is still, they were supposed to be, what we've been told is that they were supposed to be put back to what was originally there, correct?

1891
02:29:39,992 --> 02:29:40,933
And what we're seeing is,

1892
02:29:42,113 --> 02:29:46,934
concrete sidewalks that are now being hot topped over.

1893
02:29:47,575 --> 02:29:54,537
And as we all know that over time that disintegrates and it leaves a huge safety issue.

1894
02:29:54,577 --> 02:29:58,398
So if we can ask the DPW for that, that'd be, that'd be wonderful.

1895
02:29:58,458 --> 02:29:58,718
Thank you.

1896
02:30:01,123 --> 02:30:12,208
I've been waiting for a similar response from the engineering department since April of 2016 relative to the streets that have been dug up by our public utilities and the trench work that's been performed, Mr. President.

1897
02:30:12,548 --> 02:30:14,889
I've put forward more than five resolutions on this matter.

1898
02:30:14,929 --> 02:30:15,889
It's been 18 months.

1899
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:22,152
I'm going to make a friendly wager with Counselor Scott Pelley that if he gets his list before I get mine, I'll take him out for dinner.

1900
02:30:26,613 --> 02:30:28,954
You're not going to be that lucky if I win.

1901
02:30:31,445 --> 02:30:43,750
On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Langel-Kern, as amended by... The first one is good.

1902
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:47,212
The first one is, we're going to send the first one to subcommittee, am I correct?

1903
02:30:48,332 --> 02:30:53,634
On the motion by Councilor Knight, to send this to subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Langel-Kern.

1904
02:30:53,654 --> 02:30:55,255
30 day ordinance.

1905
02:30:55,275 --> 02:30:56,075
30 day ordinance.

1906
02:30:58,616 --> 02:30:59,497
And on the B paper,

1907
02:31:01,079 --> 02:31:06,524
as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1908
02:31:06,544 --> 02:31:15,972
I'm sorry, amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Falco, and Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1909
02:31:16,472 --> 02:31:17,173
All those in favor?

1910
02:31:17,933 --> 02:31:22,056
Motion passes.

1911
02:31:22,077 --> 02:31:28,702
17447, offered by Vice President Mox, being resolved that the city's potholes and crosswalks

1912
02:31:29,287 --> 02:31:30,447
be discussed.

1913
02:31:31,048 --> 02:31:32,008
Vice President Mox.

1914
02:31:33,189 --> 02:31:41,752
Let me preface my remarks, Mr. President, if I could, because I don't want this to reflect upon DPW and the highway department.

1915
02:31:43,072 --> 02:31:57,358
And in my discussions, the highway department, which is responsible for the maintenance of our roads, sidewalks, currently right now to operate efficiently and effectively,

1916
02:31:58,137 --> 02:32:03,139
to address the issues that are reported through C-Click Fix, through this council, through residents.

1917
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:08,082
They need an additional six workers just to meet the daily requirements.

1918
02:32:08,562 --> 02:32:11,683
So they're down six workers, Mr. President.

1919
02:32:11,703 --> 02:32:19,327
So I don't want this in any way to reflect upon a department, in my opinion, that is sorely, sorely understaffed.

1920
02:32:19,767 --> 02:32:22,688
But I had to bring it up tonight because I don't like what I'm seeing.

1921
02:32:22,708 --> 02:32:25,609
You know, I've been driving in this community for 35 years.

1922
02:32:27,272 --> 02:32:33,178
And I can unequivocally say I've never seen our roads in worse condition, to be quite frank.

1923
02:32:33,739 --> 02:32:35,260
I've never seen them in worse condition.

1924
02:32:35,761 --> 02:32:44,790
And now I'm seeing, Mr. President, and I don't know if my council colleagues have noticed, people are starting to paint orange neon around potholes.

1925
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:47,413
So I inquired when I saw them, I said,

1926
02:32:47,924 --> 02:32:49,665
Geez, why are people putting orange neon?

1927
02:32:50,186 --> 02:33:09,822
It's actually nice because I know to avoid the pothole, but I was told it's being done by residents, Mr. President, that are so sick and tired of having the same pothole on their street for month after month, year after year, Mr. President, some of these potholes, that they're actually calling light to these particular potholes.

1928
02:33:10,222 --> 02:33:12,024
And they look like mini crime scenes.

1929
02:33:12,443 --> 02:33:17,826
It looks like almost a body was there, Mr. President, based on the size of the pothole.

1930
02:33:18,587 --> 02:33:27,212
In addition to the potholes, Mr. President, that for whatever reason, and maybe it's because we're understaffed, we're unable to keep on top of them.

1931
02:33:27,993 --> 02:33:29,134
And I'm not sure why.

1932
02:33:29,154 --> 02:33:29,914
I'm not sure.

1933
02:33:30,354 --> 02:33:34,097
Maybe our streets are so old that this is what we're faced with now.

1934
02:33:35,097 --> 02:33:36,178
You know, maybe we should have had

1935
02:33:36,762 --> 02:33:41,464
a systematic approach to replacing our streets, which never happened over the years.

1936
02:33:41,804 --> 02:33:51,648
But we're at a place right now where there's in such deplorable condition, just patching a hole really doesn't do it merit.

1937
02:33:52,388 --> 02:33:54,149
And the manhole covers.

1938
02:33:54,915 --> 02:33:57,978
How many streets do you have to go down and avoid the manhole cover?

1939
02:33:58,358 --> 02:34:00,521
Because it's sloping down.

1940
02:34:01,201 --> 02:34:05,085
How many streets do you have to go over that you have to say, well, I've got to avoid this manhole cover?

1941
02:34:05,405 --> 02:34:11,411
Or if I get too close to the curb, I get near a catch basin that's almost sunk into the ground, and I have to avoid that.

1942
02:34:12,032 --> 02:34:15,555
It's like you're playing a Nintendo game when you're driving on these streets.

1943
02:34:15,976 --> 02:34:17,998
They're that deplorable, Mr. President,

1944
02:34:18,605 --> 02:34:21,147
And I'm not sure what it's gonna take.

1945
02:34:21,467 --> 02:34:26,230
We hear about complete streets, we hear about this is going on, that's going on.

1946
02:34:26,651 --> 02:34:29,012
It's the very basics that we need to address.

1947
02:34:30,113 --> 02:34:31,274
It's the very basics.

1948
02:34:31,734 --> 02:34:43,082
And when you tell a resident that their taxes have gone up steadily each year for 25 years, while the city services are going down, saying, well, you know what, we can't afford to do the basic maintenance.

1949
02:34:43,495 --> 02:34:48,639
We can't afford to do the basic city maintenance, Mr. President, that we need to do in this community.

1950
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:54,083
And again, the number of e-mails and calls I get, it's getting overwhelming.

1951
02:34:54,624 --> 02:34:58,567
And I asked people, I said, you may be better off reporting it to see click fix.

1952
02:34:59,467 --> 02:35:02,950
And I think the frustration with that is they get a quick answer saying,

1953
02:35:03,312 --> 02:35:06,193
It will take it under advisement and nothing ever happens.

1954
02:35:06,934 --> 02:35:13,296
So I hate to do it, Mr. President, but I have to put a few roads on there that were brought to my attention.

1955
02:35:13,796 --> 02:35:16,718
And I know people are going to say, well, it's every road, and I agree with them.

1956
02:35:17,178 --> 02:35:20,979
But Tamar Drive has a hole that you can lose a small car in.

1957
02:35:21,399 --> 02:35:22,580
That's how bad it is.

1958
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:30,483
Salem Street still has the railroad tracks from 1930 that ran down Salem Street that you can see through the road.

1959
02:35:30,723 --> 02:35:31,924
How long have I been asking for that?

1960
02:35:33,028 --> 02:35:33,308
How long?

1961
02:35:33,348 --> 02:35:35,733
I mean, talk about your request.

1962
02:35:36,014 --> 02:35:41,626
I mean, you're talking a year, two years that you can still see the tracks underneath, Mr. President.

1963
02:35:42,328 --> 02:35:43,069
Riverside Ave?

1964
02:35:44,377 --> 02:35:56,226
between the slopes and the catch basins and the manhole covers and Winthrop Street towards Boston Ave, another area that is in deplorable condition.

1965
02:35:56,666 --> 02:36:01,630
The raised crosswalk should be painted every year so people know there's a raised crosswalk.

1966
02:36:02,610 --> 02:36:06,053
You go by it, you can barely tell the difference between the raised crosswalk and the street.

1967
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:07,951
Mr. President.

1968
02:36:08,431 --> 02:36:10,552
Secondly, we talk about crosswalks.

1969
02:36:10,872 --> 02:36:13,814
How often do we talk about getting our crosswalks painted?

1970
02:36:14,675 --> 02:36:20,138
I'd venture to say that 70 percent of our crosswalks, still to date, are not painted.

1971
02:36:21,079 --> 02:36:22,980
To date, Mr. President, are not painted.

1972
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:26,322
We had the Traffic Commission several weeks back.

1973
02:36:27,943 --> 02:36:33,426
An amendment was offered before the Traffic Commission to allow Meffitt Police to now tag for jaywalking.

1974
02:36:34,069 --> 02:36:37,093
Apparently they didn't have the ability to tag for jaywalking.

1975
02:36:37,473 --> 02:36:43,960
Jaywalking, from my understanding, is crossing a street that is not in a recommended cross area, like a crosswalk.

1976
02:36:44,781 --> 02:36:52,190
Unfortunately, how do you tell residents to cross in a crosswalk that's not painted and not visual to those that are driving in the street?

1977
02:36:53,314 --> 02:36:55,096
So it doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

1978
02:36:55,796 --> 02:37:02,323
This council has voted, I know you brought it up several occasions, and I've mentioned it ad nauseam for 15 years.

1979
02:37:02,923 --> 02:37:10,410
Thermoplastic crosswalks, highly reflective, slip-resistant, their life expectancy is five years.

1980
02:37:12,132 --> 02:37:13,133
Are they a little more expensive?

1981
02:37:13,493 --> 02:37:14,074
Absolutely.

1982
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:16,400
The state uses it.

1983
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:19,301
They use it on state highways, state roads.

1984
02:37:19,761 --> 02:37:21,181
Oh, no, the city of Method knows better.

1985
02:37:21,541 --> 02:37:23,421
We can't use thermoplastic in this city.

1986
02:37:23,981 --> 02:37:26,022
Oh, no, it's too expensive, Mr. President.

1987
02:37:26,322 --> 02:37:30,383
We'll just have to fight every year to get our crosswalks painted for six months.

1988
02:37:30,743 --> 02:37:32,723
And by the time they get done, it's wintertime.

1989
02:37:33,923 --> 02:37:42,705
Mr. President, I don't know what's going on, but, you know, I'm tired of hearing about all these little niches that are out there, safe roads and safe streets.

1990
02:37:42,765 --> 02:37:44,005
And this is what's going on.

1991
02:37:44,358 --> 02:37:45,838
And that's all it is, Mr. President.

1992
02:37:46,238 --> 02:37:53,960
It's only a little niche, and it doesn't address the entire city's needs, which are basic needs, streets and sidewalks, Mr. President.

1993
02:37:54,680 --> 02:38:01,702
So, again, I would ask that we have our pothole patrol team, which I guess it sounds good to say.

1994
02:38:01,722 --> 02:38:08,744
I don't think we have one, but we get our pothole patrol team out there and start filling these potholes, Mr. President.

1995
02:38:09,516 --> 02:38:14,578
And if they can't get the substance to fill them, we can get creative.

1996
02:38:14,958 --> 02:38:16,199
Other communities, you know what they've done?

1997
02:38:16,539 --> 02:38:17,879
They've done adopt a site.

1998
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:22,761
It may sound dangerous, but you have people that will go and adopt a pothole.

1999
02:38:23,082 --> 02:38:24,042
They'll fill it with cement.

2000
02:38:24,342 --> 02:38:25,703
They'll make pitches in there.

2001
02:38:25,743 --> 02:38:27,083
They'll do mosaics.

2002
02:38:27,603 --> 02:38:29,804
And it really, it's actually very catchy.

2003
02:38:30,865 --> 02:38:34,286
But this is how their approach is to getting the city to act.

2004
02:38:34,906 --> 02:38:37,547
And maybe our approach is to do neon around the potholes.

2005
02:38:37,988 --> 02:38:38,928
And I think it's effective.

2006
02:38:39,979 --> 02:38:40,880
I thank the residents.

2007
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:42,041
I hope they don't get hurt doing it.

2008
02:38:42,322 --> 02:38:44,944
But I thank the residents because it calls the pothole to attention.

2009
02:38:45,264 --> 02:38:49,829
And I think it puts people in the city on notice, saying, hey, look, how long is this going to last?

2010
02:38:50,429 --> 02:38:52,611
And we're going to call you out on it.

2011
02:38:52,631 --> 02:38:54,353
We're going to outline it in neon.

2012
02:38:55,294 --> 02:38:59,718
I hate to be winded about it, Mr. President, but these are basic needs that aren't being addressed.

2013
02:39:00,899 --> 02:39:01,860
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2014
02:39:03,521 --> 02:39:04,282
Counselor Lugo-Kern.

2015
02:39:05,142 --> 02:39:06,503
Thank you, President Carviello.

2016
02:39:06,523 --> 02:39:13,669
I was going to put this on under suspension, the pothole part of it, because I too, but I thank Councilor Marks for beating me to it.

2017
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:22,135
The pothole problem, I've never seen, I don't think I've ever seen it so bad in my 16 years.

2018
02:39:23,196 --> 02:39:29,080
Everywhere you drive, you are dodging, you are dodging your tire from being blown out.

2019
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:31,142
Everywhere I walk in my neighborhood,

2020
02:39:31,892 --> 02:39:33,833
I've been snapping pictures like crazy.

2021
02:39:33,954 --> 02:39:35,735
I've been getting complaints like crazy.

2022
02:39:36,135 --> 02:39:44,461
And in my neighborhood where I live, there's no circles in neon yellow, but my neighbors are putting sand in the potholes.

2023
02:39:44,942 --> 02:39:47,503
Whether or not that's a good or safe thing, I don't know.

2024
02:39:47,564 --> 02:39:51,667
But I've gone around and I'm looking at potholes I saw a couple weeks ago, and they're filled with sand.

2025
02:39:52,167 --> 02:39:59,012
So I think it does probably help the car, but whether or not residents should be putting sand in it is obviously a question.

2026
02:39:59,510 --> 02:40:02,371
But I think it just goes to show how frustrated people are.

2027
02:40:02,872 --> 02:40:05,673
And I don't know what the problem is either.

2028
02:40:05,693 --> 02:40:14,378
And every time I do contact the DPW, they do respond to my concerns, and they go and fill the potholes.

2029
02:40:14,438 --> 02:40:25,823
But some sections where it needs to be completely dug up and re-put in, whether that's a portion of the street or a larger section of the road, that's not being done.

2030
02:40:25,863 --> 02:40:29,065
We just don't have the time or the manpower to do it, and that's unfortunate.

2031
02:40:29,446 --> 02:40:32,067
We're putting quick fixes on some and not on others.

2032
02:40:32,147 --> 02:40:34,668
So I think we need a systematic approach.

2033
02:40:34,768 --> 02:40:41,891
And if we need to put more money in to doing it or hire a private contractor to go street by street, it needs to be done.

2034
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:55,016
If you look on Highland and Rita, there are huge potholes and a catch basin almost completely fallen in the road.

2035
02:40:55,336 --> 02:40:56,737
You go to Doonan Street, there are

2036
02:40:57,877 --> 02:41:04,879
patch after patch after patch that keeps coming up, and you have crumbling road.

2037
02:41:05,339 --> 02:41:11,861
If you look on Short Street, there are potholes filled with sand, and this is just my neighborhood.

2038
02:41:11,901 --> 02:41:13,842
Then you go down, and you go down Bell Ave.

2039
02:41:14,522 --> 02:41:19,043
Some have been fixed, thankfully, but you go to the end of Bell Ave, and it's a mess.

2040
02:41:19,323 --> 02:41:20,424
It is an absolute mess.

2041
02:41:20,484 --> 02:41:24,665
That road's always considered a roller coaster in my family, Roller Coaster Road.

2042
02:41:25,153 --> 02:41:28,856
But you go to every adjacent street, it's just pothole after pothole.

2043
02:41:29,276 --> 02:41:31,557
And we need to figure out a way to address it.

2044
02:41:31,598 --> 02:41:44,987
So I'm asking, through an amendment, that our subcommittee or even a committee of the whole meet with the DPW director and say, if we're only getting to some of these complaints on C-Click Fix, it's not enough, and what can we do?

2045
02:41:45,407 --> 02:41:47,869
Because it's been talked about tonight.

2046
02:41:47,889 --> 02:41:51,131
We have $250,000 for our streets that we may or may not approve.

2047
02:41:51,451 --> 02:41:53,633
That survey, by the way, I believe already went out.

2048
02:41:54,378 --> 02:41:55,679
to the business districts.

2049
02:41:55,739 --> 02:42:01,662
I have seen it online, so people are, I believe, starting, they're requesting people to fill that out.

2050
02:42:02,522 --> 02:42:04,643
We need basic city services.

2051
02:42:05,004 --> 02:42:21,552
This happens every few years where it just gets so bad that this council's left saying, please, just fill potholes, paint the sidewalks, fix signage that needs to be, I mean, just the simple things that need to be done for the residents, for the safety of our community.

2052
02:42:21,952 --> 02:42:22,913
I'd love to know how many,

2053
02:42:23,949 --> 02:42:33,154
Pothole tire bus are in our law department right now with regards to, you know, people seeking reimbursement because it's ridiculous.

2054
02:42:33,414 --> 02:42:37,696
And I think we need to figure out a way, I think Committee of the Whole might be the way to go.

2055
02:42:38,136 --> 02:42:40,317
And just to ask questions, what are we doing?

2056
02:42:40,337 --> 02:42:41,478
Are we going street by street?

2057
02:42:41,558 --> 02:42:43,519
Are we just going based on complaints?

2058
02:42:44,019 --> 02:42:45,940
Because based on complaints isn't enough.

2059
02:42:46,721 --> 02:42:47,541
It really isn't enough.

2060
02:42:47,581 --> 02:42:52,844
And every week I'm getting new complaints about potholes alone, crosswalks.

2061
02:42:53,963 --> 02:42:54,804
That's another story.

2062
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:59,447
But for me, the complaints are really, really coming in with regards to the potholes.

2063
02:42:59,567 --> 02:43:02,609
And you see it as you're walking or driving around the city.

2064
02:43:03,029 --> 02:43:05,011
And I really think something needs to be done.

2065
02:43:05,031 --> 02:43:07,272
I think we need to get a grasp on it as a council.

2066
02:43:07,713 --> 02:43:12,376
I know we will do that come June when we meet with the DPW director in person.

2067
02:43:12,436 --> 02:43:13,877
But I think that's too far to wait.

2068
02:43:13,897 --> 02:43:19,541
I think within the next couple weeks, we should sit down and say, what can we do to help, what can we

2069
02:43:20,548 --> 02:43:23,569
do to ask this administration to make sure we have enough fill.

2070
02:43:23,929 --> 02:43:24,629
Is that a problem?

2071
02:43:24,669 --> 02:43:25,629
Do we have enough fill?

2072
02:43:25,949 --> 02:43:27,450
Do we not have enough manpower?

2073
02:43:28,970 --> 02:43:32,851
What are we, what are we doing wrong or what can we do right to make this right?

2074
02:43:33,371 --> 02:43:36,292
Um, because it's, it's just extremely unsafe.

2075
02:43:36,372 --> 02:43:39,232
It's unsightly and it's something we need to get a handle on.

2076
02:43:39,872 --> 02:43:40,753
June is in two weeks.

2077
02:43:41,353 --> 02:43:42,713
Counselor Nights.

2078
02:43:42,773 --> 02:43:43,493
Yes, Mr. President.

2079
02:43:43,513 --> 02:43:44,193
Thank you very much.

2080
02:43:44,253 --> 02:43:45,274
I moved to amend the paper.

2081
02:43:45,354 --> 02:43:46,854
I have several amendments I'd like to add.

2082
02:43:47,757 --> 02:43:59,025
Back in 2016, I filed a resolution requesting that the DPW, namely the engineering department, provide us with an estimate as to what it would cost to totally resurface the emergency arteries in our community.

2083
02:43:59,826 --> 02:44:03,829
They came back with an estimate of $6.75 million at that time, Mr. President.

2084
02:44:04,489 --> 02:44:13,475
I'd ask for an updated cost estimate as to what it would cost to resurface the emergency arteries in the city of Medford, Clerk Finn.

2085
02:44:14,436 --> 02:44:17,238
And I'd also like to ask when each street

2086
02:44:17,687 --> 02:44:21,150
that is designated as an emergency artery was last resurfaced.

2087
02:44:24,232 --> 02:44:24,772
Second Amendment.

2088
02:44:24,792 --> 02:44:41,184
Mr. President, I'd like to make a, would be this, um, back about eight months ago, the Medford city council recommended that the DPW division, um, examine the feasibility of creating a standalone signage and striping department to address some of the concerns that we have relative to signage and striping.

2089
02:44:41,805 --> 02:44:42,365
Makes sense, right?

2090
02:44:43,361 --> 02:44:52,945
So I'd ask for an update, Mr. President, as we prepare for the budget, I'd like to reiterate the council's position that this is something that we'd like to see examined and potentially be placed in the DPW budget.

2091
02:44:54,145 --> 02:45:05,450
And third, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper requesting that the engineering division provide written response to the Memphis City Council as to why paper 16404 has not been answered yet after a year and a half.

2092
02:45:08,151 --> 02:45:08,831
Councilor Felco.

2093
02:45:09,191 --> 02:45:09,991
Thank you, Mr. President.

2094
02:45:10,011 --> 02:45:11,932
I want to thank my council colleagues,

2095
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,941
Councilor Moxley, bring this forward.

2096
02:45:15,561 --> 02:45:18,303
This is definitely a concern in every neighborhood throughout our city.

2097
02:45:18,943 --> 02:45:23,485
And I would definitely be in favor of having a committee, the whole meeting to discuss this.

2098
02:45:25,066 --> 02:45:28,548
It's, you know, we talk about emergency arteries, but this is just everywhere.

2099
02:45:28,748 --> 02:45:32,990
I mean, you go to, you can go to probably every side street, you're going to find something.

2100
02:45:33,090 --> 02:45:38,392
But I mean, there are some major issues throughout our community, in every neighborhood.

2101
02:45:38,632 --> 02:45:41,214
And I get calls about them, just like my colleagues do.

2102
02:45:43,826 --> 02:45:52,311
If I could add the lower half of Fern Road to that list, there is a hole that's getting bigger by the day.

2103
02:45:52,331 --> 02:45:55,433
So if we could add that on, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2104
02:45:55,733 --> 02:46:00,516
It needs to be addressed because someone is seriously gonna do some serious damage to their car.

2105
02:46:00,876 --> 02:46:02,157
So thank you very much.

2106
02:46:02,677 --> 02:46:11,102
Thank you, and it was a request that I made, I think two years ago, asking for a permanent sidewalk crew.

2107
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:13,321
They were just two sidewalks every day.

2108
02:46:15,262 --> 02:46:17,444
We're still waiting an answer for that.

2109
02:46:18,004 --> 02:46:20,166
Mr. President, Mr. President, if I may.

2110
02:46:20,586 --> 02:46:24,088
Last weekend, a resolution with regard to see click fix.

2111
02:46:25,269 --> 02:46:33,735
If we could just get an update as to when we're going to receive that list, because it would be beneficial to all of us that we receive that list before the budget hearing.

2112
02:46:33,835 --> 02:46:39,399
Because, you know, you talk about, you know, staffing and we all need.

2113
02:46:39,779 --> 02:46:40,860
We all know that we need.

2114
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:46,682
more people on that department, but you get a true indication when you take a look at that, see quick fix.

2115
02:46:46,702 --> 02:46:50,444
You can use it as a tool, you know, to actually see what's not getting done.

2116
02:46:50,704 --> 02:46:52,985
And I think it would tell a good picture.

2117
02:46:53,005 --> 02:46:56,246
So if we could get an update as to when we will receive that, greatly appreciate it.

2118
02:46:56,266 --> 02:46:56,566
Thank you.

2119
02:46:56,826 --> 02:46:57,126
Thank you.

2120
02:46:58,047 --> 02:46:58,967
And address the director, please.

2121
02:46:59,247 --> 02:47:01,068
Paul Gucciari, 37 Duden street.

2122
02:47:01,088 --> 02:47:05,110
So I just want to thank everybody and acknowledge your counselors for bringing this forward.

2123
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:06,170
But I got some ideas.

2124
02:47:07,250 --> 02:47:11,052
One is I heard $7 million today you have in the water fund,

2125
02:47:11,509 --> 02:47:12,837
reappropriate some of that money.

2126
02:47:13,872 --> 02:47:15,312
to repair the roads.

2127
02:47:15,892 --> 02:47:19,093
I know you're shaking your head, but you gotta look at it.

2128
02:47:19,913 --> 02:47:24,574
You get free cash and so, and another thing I would suggest, you said you're short staff.

2129
02:47:25,394 --> 02:47:36,596
Contractors, bring them in during the spring, during the fall, get them to repair the roads, it gets done, you're not adding much overhead, you're not paying for healthcare, things like that, they're not permanent on the payroll.

2130
02:47:37,956 --> 02:47:41,717
I would also suggest what you said, 30 days for the trees not being cut, the stumps.

2131
02:47:42,537 --> 02:47:45,765
Establish service level agreements with the different departments in the city.

2132
02:47:46,506 --> 02:47:47,910
So 30 days to do some work.

2133
02:47:47,930 --> 02:47:49,573
If they're not done, you fine them.

2134
02:47:50,571 --> 02:47:52,032
I live with that every day in my job.

2135
02:47:52,532 --> 02:47:57,175
If I don't do something for the customer within a certain amount of time, I owe them money.

2136
02:47:57,695 --> 02:47:59,156
So you could work something out like that.

2137
02:47:59,936 --> 02:48:10,242
Another idea is, as the police are patrolling the streets, maybe they could take some notes, turn it in in their daily report, and say, I see a pothole there, I see a pothole there.

2138
02:48:11,063 --> 02:48:16,406
I saw the orange signs last summer on the streets going by LaCasse's on the way to work every day.

2139
02:48:16,846 --> 02:48:18,867
I said, oh, finally, the city's going to do something.

2140
02:48:19,505 --> 02:48:20,165
Did it get done?

2141
02:48:20,226 --> 02:48:21,346
No, the paint just wore out.

2142
02:48:23,187 --> 02:48:28,251
So all I can say is, as you're talking to the departments, is there any pride in the city?

2143
02:48:29,672 --> 02:48:32,313
If you have pride in the city, then something will be done.

2144
02:48:33,494 --> 02:48:33,874
Thank you.

2145
02:48:34,155 --> 02:48:34,455
Thank you.

2146
02:48:37,097 --> 02:48:37,797
Councilor Nights.

2147
02:48:38,578 --> 02:48:40,279
Mr. President, the gentleman makes a good point.

2148
02:48:40,699 --> 02:48:46,723
In other communities that surround the city, namely the city of Boston, which is very successful in the delivery of

2149
02:48:47,265 --> 02:48:50,170
public works projects based upon, especially based upon the size.

2150
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:54,797
One of the things that they've implemented in the city of Boston, I believe, would be a residency requirement for department heads.

2151
02:48:56,160 --> 02:49:00,881
And I think that that's something that might warrant a little bit of examination, Mr. President.

2152
02:49:00,941 --> 02:49:12,984
I mean, ultimately, if someone lives in the community and they have to go to the same supermarket that we have to go to and listen to the same complaints that we have to listen to and the same concerns that we're here for and here to address, I just think it makes them take a little bit more pride in their job.

2153
02:49:13,024 --> 02:49:23,687
Because I know, as I think back to a former gentleman that was working in our school department, and he was called to the carpet for some actions, and the quote in the newspaper was,

2154
02:49:24,215 --> 02:49:29,017
Well, it's very easy for this gentleman to get in his car and drive up to Bellingham at the end, uh, Beverly at the end of the day.

2155
02:49:29,598 --> 02:49:34,480
But those of us that live in this community and call it home, care about it and care what's going on.

2156
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:35,540
And we have a vested interest.

2157
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:37,581
And I think that that's something that we might want to examine as well.

2158
02:49:37,601 --> 02:49:39,222
Mr. President move approval on the question.

2159
02:49:39,662 --> 02:49:40,002
Thank you.

2160
02:49:40,043 --> 02:49:51,328
Counselor night on the motion by vice president marks seconded by counselor night as amended by counselor Falco counselor knife.

2161
02:49:53,449 --> 02:49:53,589
Uh,

2162
02:50:05,574 --> 02:50:15,883
And if we if we could request that we have a council of the whole meeting as soon as possible to discuss these matters Yes This is we're gonna do this paper

2163
02:50:20,688 --> 02:50:25,130
And then we'll be recommended that we have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss this matter.

2164
02:50:25,650 --> 02:50:26,930
I will call a committee of the whole meeting.

2165
02:50:28,471 --> 02:50:31,112
I will call a committee of the whole meeting.

2166
02:50:31,212 --> 02:50:31,952
All those in favor?

2167
02:50:33,233 --> 02:50:34,093
Motion passes.

2168
02:50:36,674 --> 02:50:37,254
For just a moment.

2169
02:50:37,712 --> 02:50:43,919
Councilman, I'd just like to take an opportunity to thank the tree warden and the forestry division.

2170
02:50:44,379 --> 02:50:48,523
Two weeks ago, we put forward a request asking for a tree to be replaced in front of 112 Grant Ave.

2171
02:50:49,044 --> 02:50:49,825
That work's been done.

2172
02:50:49,885 --> 02:50:51,486
It was done like in two days.

2173
02:50:51,887 --> 02:50:56,071
So I'm very thankful for the work that they do, and I appreciate their prompt response to the inquiry.

2174
02:50:57,232 --> 02:50:57,533
Thank you.

2175
02:50:59,239 --> 02:51:01,640
17456 offered by Councilor Knight.

2176
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:11,606
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Richard Bubba Matos on his recent passing.

2177
02:51:11,706 --> 02:51:12,446
Councilor Knight.

2178
02:51:12,967 --> 02:51:14,768
Yes, Mr. President, after

2179
02:51:15,961 --> 02:51:17,982
brief illness, Mr. Meadows passed away.

2180
02:51:18,562 --> 02:51:19,903
Services were held yesterday.

2181
02:51:20,823 --> 02:51:26,666
He was a great fellow, a gentleman that always opened the doors to his home and let us kids run wild in there.

2182
02:51:26,926 --> 02:51:29,607
He kept letting us come back day after day and year after year.

2183
02:51:29,707 --> 02:51:31,468
And he was really just a great individual.

2184
02:51:31,548 --> 02:51:35,089
He had a great sense of community, a great sense of pride in his neighborhood.

2185
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:38,491
And he will be sadly missed down on Bradshaw Street, Mr. President, and beyond.

2186
02:51:38,511 --> 02:51:44,494
I'd move for approval of the paper and ask my council colleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family.

2187
02:51:45,552 --> 02:51:58,980
If we could raise for a moment of silence, please.

2188
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:11,247
17454, petition by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, to address the council on mother-in-law apartments being converted to condos or to families.

2189
02:52:12,077 --> 02:52:13,578
Name and address for the record, please.

2190
02:52:13,858 --> 02:52:14,219
Thank you.

2191
02:52:14,239 --> 02:52:15,580
Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

2192
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:21,544
A couple of weeks ago, one of the houses on my street got flipped.

2193
02:52:23,085 --> 02:52:26,928
And while everything was above board, I'm not complaining about the way it was handled.

2194
02:52:27,188 --> 02:52:28,108
It was within the law.

2195
02:52:28,709 --> 02:52:30,971
But I just want to make people aware of a couple of things.

2196
02:52:32,832 --> 02:52:34,253
First of all, is the human interest.

2197
02:52:35,063 --> 02:52:47,914
the human side of it, which is that I would encourage mother-in-law apartments or father-in-law apartments or sons or whatever, because it's better than warehousing them in a nursing home or whatever.

2198
02:52:48,614 --> 02:52:57,341
If you can't afford $5,000 to $6,000, $7,000 a month, then you end up farming them out into large facilities.

2199
02:52:57,922 --> 02:52:58,683
So that's number one.

2200
02:52:58,723 --> 02:53:03,486
Number two, developers come in here.

2201
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:06,861
They swoop in like vultures.

2202
02:53:07,401 --> 02:53:09,101
This is a hot city right now.

2203
02:53:09,121 --> 02:53:10,782
It's been hot for three or four or five years.

2204
02:53:11,742 --> 02:53:19,704
And if I collected all of the postcards and letters that I get from real estate people and developers, I would look like Santa Claus.

2205
02:53:20,044 --> 02:53:21,545
I would have a bag filled with them.

2206
02:53:23,445 --> 02:53:28,427
They come in, and in this case, it happened to me on my street.

2207
02:53:28,927 --> 02:53:33,328
Not that it's going to make or break the city, the street, that one house was converted

2208
02:53:34,205 --> 02:53:37,868
to two condos that was originally a single-family house.

2209
02:53:38,629 --> 02:53:43,653
They had a mother-in-law apartment, and they got permission to turn it into a two-family.

2210
02:53:43,953 --> 02:53:45,174
This is a single family.

2211
02:53:45,574 --> 02:53:49,737
They took out all the green grass in the back so that they could have the parking that's required.

2212
02:53:50,118 --> 02:53:51,499
So now you lost the green space.

2213
02:53:52,319 --> 02:53:55,782
And I'll get to that, but I have a chip on my shoulder about developers.

2214
02:53:56,182 --> 02:53:57,603
So I want to get that off my chest.

2215
02:53:59,745 --> 02:54:01,626
Developers come in here from outside.

2216
02:54:01,967 --> 02:54:03,528
They flip at the house, and they leave.

2217
02:54:05,067 --> 02:54:07,228
that's great for them, you know.

2218
02:54:07,628 --> 02:54:10,328
And the other thing is, you guys were talking about water.

2219
02:54:11,068 --> 02:54:15,589
Development doesn't mean it's good for me and my street.

2220
02:54:16,349 --> 02:54:22,271
When they built across the way, they pitched the driveway, so now the water came into my basement.

2221
02:54:22,711 --> 02:54:29,032
So I used to have a little flower bed, not much, a little mulch, little flowers, little few rocks with the bricks around it.

2222
02:54:29,492 --> 02:54:33,413
I had to pave over that because I had to raise my pitch

2223
02:54:33,914 --> 02:54:38,335
so that now it goes back down to the street, and then down the street, so it was great for them.

2224
02:54:38,996 --> 02:54:49,339
The other thing, the third point, and I'm trying to be quick, I know it's late, but I want to make you aware that, the third point was, conflicts, okay?

2225
02:54:50,099 --> 02:54:58,522
Conflicts between neighbors, fences make good neighbors, and when you have a single family house that had the second floor turned into,

2226
02:55:00,567 --> 02:55:05,652
a mother-in-law apartment, which at least they're family, so they're connected, they're relational, it's not so bad.

2227
02:55:05,732 --> 02:55:21,105
But when you turn, the base of the house is going to be bigger than the upstairs, then you have to put in new, totally new boilers, totally new infrastructure, and who's going to be responsible to shovel the driveway in the winter?

2228
02:55:21,946 --> 02:55:23,147
If you look at that property,

2229
02:55:23,996 --> 02:55:25,517
They, they're going to the back of the house.

2230
02:55:25,917 --> 02:55:27,619
They could have arguments over who's going to shovel.

2231
02:55:28,319 --> 02:55:32,222
They could have arguments over paying the insurance bill, the insurance bill.

2232
02:55:32,322 --> 02:55:33,603
Now, sure.

2233
02:55:33,683 --> 02:55:33,983
Go ahead.

2234
02:55:35,004 --> 02:55:36,185
One of the major counseling.

2235
02:55:36,365 --> 02:55:48,054
I do believe the majority of the issues that, um, the speaker is discussing would be outlined in the condo documents or the HOA documents that would be established when a multifamily house becomes condominiums and that gets filed with the registry of deeds.

2236
02:55:48,694 --> 02:55:49,014
Thank you.

2237
02:55:49,054 --> 02:55:49,575
Counselor.

2238
02:55:50,115 --> 02:55:50,515
Thank you.

2239
02:55:50,656 --> 02:55:52,597
And I do agree with that except for one thing.

2240
02:55:53,041 --> 02:56:05,090
If you're dealing with just two people or two entities and one doesn't pay their side of the bill, that insurance policy gets canceled if the other person doesn't pay for it.

2241
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:09,153
So these are conflicts that you're bringing on for no good reason.

2242
02:56:09,173 --> 02:56:16,379
You do not have to, and I thank you for your point, but you do not have to do this.

2243
02:56:16,479 --> 02:56:18,560
This is optional.

2244
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:22,263
This is unlike my house where it changed from a family

2245
02:56:23,549 --> 02:56:27,092
situation where I had my aunt downstairs, and everybody was relational.

2246
02:56:27,472 --> 02:56:29,673
We didn't have a contract growing up.

2247
02:56:30,053 --> 02:56:31,034
There was no contract.

2248
02:56:31,574 --> 02:56:32,955
And then I had to rent it out.

2249
02:56:35,036 --> 02:56:38,879
It's something that I had to do in order to survive, right?

2250
02:56:39,239 --> 02:56:49,726
But this is an option to turn a single-family house with a mother-in-law or father-in-law apartment into a two-family or a two-condo, because now you're adding more stress to the family.

2251
02:56:50,546 --> 02:56:51,607
That doesn't have to happen.

2252
02:56:52,387 --> 02:56:54,988
But it's just because the developer wants to make more money.

2253
02:56:55,508 --> 02:56:58,249
This is a money incentive for somebody living outside the city.

2254
02:56:58,909 --> 02:57:02,650
And it's completely unnecessary to have to do it this way.

2255
02:57:02,891 --> 02:57:03,911
It's great for the developer.

2256
02:57:04,671 --> 02:57:05,311
They make money.

2257
02:57:05,772 --> 02:57:10,673
But then the conflicts that can happen between these two condos when you do it with a two-family house, too.

2258
02:57:10,693 --> 02:57:13,094
It doesn't matter if it's a single family with a mother-in-law.

2259
02:57:13,484 --> 02:57:14,325
or a two-family house.

2260
02:57:14,365 --> 02:57:20,989
When you do this, if one partner doesn't keep up their grass, you're on top of that person.

2261
02:57:21,289 --> 02:57:25,792
It's bad enough when they're next door and there's 10 or 12 feet between the property lines.

2262
02:57:26,172 --> 02:57:32,776
Now you're literally living up and down, and you're thumping, and there's no hierarchy of authority.

2263
02:57:33,316 --> 02:57:35,998
And it would bury you in legal costs

2264
02:57:37,713 --> 02:57:42,455
You're one person up against the other person, and they both have legal standing in the same way.

2265
02:57:42,895 --> 02:57:47,036
I have a 22-page contract with my tenant to protect me.

2266
02:57:47,397 --> 02:57:51,798
And unlike when I was growing up, I didn't have to worry about putting everything in writing.

2267
02:57:52,018 --> 02:57:53,439
Today, you have to put everything in writing.

2268
02:57:53,979 --> 02:57:55,280
Unfortunately, that's just the way it is.

2269
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:58,321
And the feel of the house is different than when it was relatives.

2270
02:57:58,841 --> 02:58:02,942
I used to go into my aunt's kitchen and right into the fridge and grab a Popsicle.

2271
02:58:03,563 --> 02:58:04,543
That feel is gone.

2272
02:58:04,970 --> 02:58:06,852
And that is a loss to me, you know.

2273
02:58:07,292 --> 02:58:11,596
So, but it's unnecessary growth or whatever you want to call it.

2274
02:58:11,636 --> 02:58:13,537
Sell it as a single family house.

2275
02:58:13,617 --> 02:58:14,418
There's no problem.

2276
02:58:14,598 --> 02:58:15,859
You just don't make as much profit.

2277
02:58:16,259 --> 02:58:16,900
That's the difference.

2278
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:17,260
Thank you.

2279
02:58:18,181 --> 02:58:18,641
Thank you.

2280
02:58:19,622 --> 02:58:22,184
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive in place on file.

2281
02:58:22,585 --> 02:58:27,909
Mr. President, I feel as though the market controls what it is that developers are seeking to do.

2282
02:58:28,069 --> 02:58:33,514
And as we see the baby boomer generation reach a certain age right now where they're looking to downsize, there is a demand for condominiums.

2283
02:58:33,927 --> 02:58:34,487
in our city.

2284
02:58:34,587 --> 02:58:42,693
That's why in the past I've brought forward requests to work with the city assessor to discuss condo conversion and whether or not we need a bylaw to address that.

2285
02:58:43,273 --> 02:58:47,997
But I feel as though the market controls exactly what it is that would happen in development.

2286
02:58:48,077 --> 02:58:55,922
And right now there is a push towards condominium living, and I believe it's attributable to the fact that the baby boomer generation is reaching an age where they're seeking downsize.

2287
02:58:57,203 --> 02:58:58,504
Motion to receive and place on file.

2288
02:58:58,984 --> 02:59:00,405
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

2289
02:59:00,425 --> 02:59:01,065
All those in favor?

2290
02:59:02,666 --> 02:59:03,427
Motion passes.

2291
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:17,050
Reports of committee 17382, subcommittee on environmental affairs committee report regarding municipal aggregation from May 9th, 2017 subcommittee meeting.

2292
02:59:17,530 --> 02:59:29,079
The subcommittee met on May 9th with several residents in attendance along with counselors to discuss municipal aggregation.

2293
02:59:31,860 --> 02:59:40,927
The recommendation of the committee was to send the paper to the Committee of Whole for discussion with the whole body of councillors.

2294
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:46,011
Motion to accept that paper.

2295
02:59:46,572 --> 02:59:47,392
Question, Mr. President.

2296
02:59:48,013 --> 02:59:48,713
Councillor Naith.

2297
02:59:48,974 --> 02:59:52,877
I do believe that this paper has been before the Committee of the Whole on two previous occasions.

2298
02:59:52,897 --> 02:59:53,477
You are correct.

2299
02:59:53,737 --> 02:59:56,219
Sent to subcommittee for recommendations on how to move forward.

2300
02:59:56,239 --> 02:59:59,182
Are there any recommendations that are coming out of the subcommittee as to how they'd like to

2301
02:59:59,939 --> 03:00:01,740
recommend the committee of the whole proceed.

2302
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:04,521
Is there a presentation of some sort that's going to be performed?

2303
03:00:04,861 --> 03:00:07,843
There was, there was no, uh, there was a presentation made that evening.

2304
03:00:07,863 --> 03:00:11,425
Um, and there was some discussion.

2305
03:00:11,445 --> 03:00:14,226
I think counselor Marks, you can speak to that.

2306
03:00:14,266 --> 03:00:15,887
You are the chairman of that subcommittee.

2307
03:00:17,168 --> 03:00:27,455
Mr. President, that meeting was set up at a request at the Committee of the Whole by Councilor Dela Russo to have further dialogue, and that's exactly what took place.

2308
03:00:28,255 --> 03:00:31,437
We invited Alicia Hunt from the Energy and Environment Committee.

2309
03:00:32,077 --> 03:00:44,725
We also invited Curtis Tooden, who is the committee chairman of Energy Environment Commission, and he gave a thorough explanation on green initiatives that

2310
03:00:45,545 --> 03:00:49,026
we as a council could do because it's based on city ordinance.

2311
03:00:49,847 --> 03:00:58,730
And he also gave a presentation on the need for municipal aggregation in this community, which I think we all heard already.

2312
03:00:59,210 --> 03:01:03,071
So I'm not sure if there's anything new to add to the dialogue and discussion.

2313
03:01:03,751 --> 03:01:05,552
We did do our due diligence as a committee.

2314
03:01:05,852 --> 03:01:11,334
We met, we listened to residents input, and we decided that ultimately it'll be a vote of this council.

2315
03:01:12,174 --> 03:01:14,735
And there was one caveat that was mentioned

2316
03:01:16,540 --> 03:01:18,843
City Solicitor Mark Rumley was present at the meeting.

2317
03:01:19,644 --> 03:01:25,272
He was asked by myself to reach out to House Council.

2318
03:01:26,100 --> 03:01:37,029
which is before the state legislature, and ask whether or not we as a city can file a home rule petition to actually craft the current state law a little differently.

2319
03:01:37,569 --> 03:01:45,075
Right now, if we were to vote on this municipal aggregation, everyone by default would be opted into the program.

2320
03:01:45,555 --> 03:01:49,416
So residents don't have a say, everyone's opted in by default.

2321
03:01:49,896 --> 03:01:54,258
Now you have an opt-out clause that you can do to get out of the program if you'd like.

2322
03:01:55,038 --> 03:02:12,383
My request to the city solicitor was to see if we can reverse that and have it be an opt-in clause, where if people are interested in joining municipal aggregation, that the city move forward and we set up a pool of people that are interested in going into municipal aggregation.

2323
03:02:13,065 --> 03:02:25,634
And according to the city solicitor, with home rule petitions, the state legislature doesn't like to alter a law in a way that takes from the original intent.

2324
03:02:26,375 --> 03:02:33,440
And he felt that by doing the opt-in was not doing away with the original intent, and so did House Council.

2325
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:35,362
So he said that could be an option.

2326
03:02:36,422 --> 03:02:55,413
If we as a body, and that's one of the things that was presented that night, wanted to have the paper sent to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, because the paper has to originate, has been passed practice by the mayor, to offer a home rule petition with an opt-in clause.

2327
03:02:56,153 --> 03:02:57,574
And that's where it stands, Mr. President.

2328
03:02:57,594 --> 03:02:58,855
I think we're all aware of the issue.

2329
03:02:59,535 --> 03:03:04,177
I don't think there's any magic smoking gun that's going to come out of any particular subcommittee meeting.

2330
03:03:04,837 --> 03:03:05,758
Um, it is what it is.

2331
03:03:05,778 --> 03:03:18,944
Um, and if people don't know what it is, then members of the council should ask questions to Alicia hunt or, uh, through the mass municipal association or, or, or even surrounding communities that are moving forward on it.

2332
03:03:19,584 --> 03:03:20,024
So thank you.

2333
03:03:20,044 --> 03:03:24,046
Mr. Vice president, the motion by council night that we accept the paper.

2334
03:03:24,977 --> 03:03:26,358
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

2335
03:03:26,759 --> 03:03:27,599
All those in favor?

2336
03:03:28,320 --> 03:03:29,100
Motion passes.

2337
03:03:29,801 --> 03:03:36,266
The records were passed to Councilor DelaRosa who has gone home ill.

2338
03:03:37,648 --> 03:03:40,009
So I ask that they be tabled until next week.

2339
03:03:41,130 --> 03:03:42,792
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight.

2340
03:03:43,472 --> 03:03:44,333
Seconded by Councilor Salazar.
