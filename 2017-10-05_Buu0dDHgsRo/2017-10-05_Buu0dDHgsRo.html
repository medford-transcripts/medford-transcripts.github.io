    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5.808s">Nineteenth</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9.309s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=12.451s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=13.651s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=14.692s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=15.712s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=16.492s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=17.173s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=18.053s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehnan? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=19.774s">Vice</a>  President Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=21.074s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=21.834s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=22.915s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=23.715s">President</a>  Caraviello?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=24.996s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=26.276s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=45.83s">17-419,</a>  offered by Vice President Michael Mox, accommodation for Mae Marbrek, 25 years of recognition as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=59.859s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=85.182s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=85.963s">It's</a>  an honor and a pleasure to represent this council accommodation to what I refer to as a dear friend of mine for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=97.11s">I</a>  met Mae probably back some, and I don't want to date you Mae, back some 25 years ago through different city organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=107.237s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate after all these years and all the different organizations that Mae has belonged to, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=114.824s">that</a>  she received the recognition, not that she'd want, because May, if you know May, May never looks for recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=122.467s">May's</a>  always behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=124.347s">She's</a>  the engine driving what goes on in this community, and never once looked for any type of praise or accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=131.87s">And</a>  even tonight, I want to thank Council President Caraviello for making the phone call to say, hey May, can you come down to Tuesday's meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=139.632s">Multiple</a>  phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=140.573s">Multiple</a>  phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=142.861s">Can</a>  you come down to Tuesday's meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=144.702s">And</a>  I think May may have had an idea or not, I'm not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=148.884s">But</a>  needless to say, I would at this point, I'd like to recognize, I served the last few years on the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium, alongside May and a number of other real activists in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=166.412s">And</a>  at this point, I would just like to recognize the board in which we sat on <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=172.345s">Cindy</a>  Watson, co-president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=174.907s">Mike</a>  Cerullo, co-president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=177.549s">Keith</a>  Barry, member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=180.372s">Representative</a>  Paul Donato, member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=182.674s">Susan</a>  Fairchild, member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=185.156s">Ken</a>  Kraus, member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=187.398s">May</a>  Makibrek, member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=189.9s">And</a>  Russ Rossetti, member of the Friends of Chevalier board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=194.443s">You</a>  know, May, little known fact, was a Mustang Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=201.015s">back</a>  some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=202.376s">Right,</a>  May? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=203.497s">Where</a>  is May? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=204.177s">May,</a>  where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=205.057s">You're</a>  up over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=207.439s">Mustang</a>  Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=210.141s">May</a>  was the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=215.464s">Cachet.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=216.745s">It</a>  was the brainchild of May, meeting with a few people in the community regarding the arts, that put together Cachet, the Coalition for Art, Culture, and Healthy Economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=228.211s">And,</a>  you know, May won't say it, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=231.056s">Those</a>  were May's ideas originally back many, many years ago to put organizations together, to link the community up, and pull in all different backgrounds in order to move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=245.024s">While</a>  promoting the arts is a main goal of CACHE, it also aims to bolster the local economy at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=254.409s">Looking</a>  ahead, we are hoping to create a more vibrant arts and cultural scene in Method, which in turn <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=260.989s">will</a>  promote economic development, May Makibrek said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=265.031s">That</a>  part of it cannot be overlooked and it is what we feel sets the group apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=271.535s">We</a>  all work together as equals with one big exception, John Anderson said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=277.079s">May</a>  Makibrek is really the driving force and she has been so enthusiastic and youthful and full of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=284.203s">You</a>  need a person like that if a coalition such as this has any chance of surviving, which it is <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=290.87s">a</a>  good sign for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=294.552s">May</a>  served as the President of Springstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=297.675s">She</a>  also served on the Board of Directors for Brooks Estate's Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=304.859s">May</a>  was recognized by the Chamber of Commerce as Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=310.298s">Who</a>  can forget May's article which appeared in the March 14, 2014 edition of the Method transcript honoring Method Olympic champion Mary Carew Armstrong for National Women's History Month, or the countless letters to the editor in which May offered support to local organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=333.85s">As</a>  we all know, May was part of a lot of different civic groups, but she was also very vocal on the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=340.207s">And</a>  May, she wasn't a wallflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=343.889s">She</a>  let it be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=345.749s">She</a>  let it be known where she stood in an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=348.611s">And</a>  if there was an issue that was confronting the residents of this community, you better believe May was at that podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=356.614s">I</a>  remember the night the Medford Public Library was experiencing roof leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=361.516s">And</a>  guess who was at the podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=364.487s">We</a>  have very, very dedicated people who are here tonight, members of the staff of the library, just hoping that the ceiling tiles in the building that they're working wouldn't fall in on their head, said Mae Mockeybrook, president of the Medford Coalition for the Arts at the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=382.252s">This</a>  is disgraceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=385.633s">We</a>  often remember the debate with art funding in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=389.863s">The</a>  city never funded arts in the budget, and a few years ago, this council offered a resolution to put arts in the budget, and May was at the podium once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=399.051s">I</a>  think it's fair to say we're in an arts revolution, said May Makibrek. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=403.414s">Medford</a>  has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=404.755s">We</a>  are no longer a streetcar suburb. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=407.237s">We're</a>  a vibrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=408.999s">We</a>  have a great deal to offer, and there is an arts movement going on at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=417.157s">Several</a>  years back, we had the Brooks Estates bond proposal that was before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=421.599s">Quite</a>  a contentious issue for some. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=424.741s">May,</a>  again, was at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=427.102s">The</a>  Brooks Estates has been treated by the city like an orphan, said Medford resident May Marky-Brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=435.027s">In</a>  2010, community leaders were pushing to build up the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=440.61s">May</a>  stated, now that the problem is not so much the condition of the theater, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=445.689s">which</a>  like any property requires ongoing maintenance, but the underutilization of the Chevalier Theater, she said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=451.992s">How</a>  much longer are we going to talk, continue to see a valuable asset in our community be underutilized and waste the opportunity to have Chevalier Theater become an engine of economic development in Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=467.14s">These</a>  are just a few of the things that I recall May working on over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=473.076s">as</a>  a community activist, as someone who wholeheartedly cared about the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=481.479s">You</a>  couldn't find anyone more responsive to the needs of the Boys and Girls Club, which is on Forest Street, than May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=490.083s">The</a>  arts movement, I think, May was the art movement for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=499.247s">And</a>  it's only appropriate tonight that we take the time to <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=503.193s">And</a>  I see this audience is filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=504.933s">It's</a>  not many times that this audience gets filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=507.714s">And</a>  it's my distinct honor and pleasure to thank my friend, May Makibrek, for her many years of dedicated service. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=520.237s">And</a>  I know some members of the council want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=523.358s">I'd</a>  just like to read the citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=525.359s">And</a>  May, we have a few more speeches, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=528.759s">There's</a>  a nice comfy seat next to you if you want to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=533.028s">It</a>  says the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Mae Makibrek in recognition of her 25 years of distinguished service as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gymnasium, signed May 16th by Council President Richard Caraviello and Vice President Michael J. Mox.</p>

    <p>[0HXibsUvumY_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=585.667s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=588.489s">I'm</a>  just going to do a little word checking and make sure that I did say all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=598.274s">Well,</a>  this is a very special moment, and I appreciate all of you have come here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=607.199s">When</a>  President Caraviello called me, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=610.632s">about</a>  coming here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=612.914s">I</a>  thought he was going to ask me to be on a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=617.697s">And</a>  I was going to have to say, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=623.321s">At</a>  any rate, in accepting this very, very wonderful tribute, I also have to give a lot of credit <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=640.328s">to</a>  all of the people who have been working on the Friends of Chevalier for the past 25 years, those past and those present, some of which are here in the chamber tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=654.275s">And</a>  thinking back about that early time, I would just like to remember a few of our dear friends who are probably looking down on us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=670.466s">And</a>  that would be Teresa Cerullo, wife of Michael Cerullo, and John Nostry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=682.589s">And</a>  there may be others that I hope I haven't overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=690.551s">Dick</a>  Oba, who were very, very much a part of the early days when we <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=698.938s">establish</a>  the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=701.54s">And</a>  over the years, uh, the group has worked very diligently and very quietly, but has accomplished a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=711.886s">In</a>  fact, in addition to being advocates for the theater and the Boys and Girls Club for these many years, they also raised a considerable amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=724.813s">And</a>  believe it or not, that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=728.217s">more</a>  than $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=741.284s">One</a>  of the major grants that was given to the Friends was from the Cummings Foundation, which is a local philanthropic <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=758.308s">philanthropic</a>  organization by Bill Cummings and his wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=766.211s">As</a>  you know, the property here adjoining us is owned by the Cummings people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=772.993s">So</a>  they gave $100,000 to add staff to the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=782.896s">And</a>  I have to say that I'm very, very proud <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=786.868s">that</a>  the friends were a big part of the Boys and Girls Club coming here to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=794.714s">They</a>  have been extremely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=799.217s">They</a>  still have a waiting list in spite of the additional money that they received from the Cummings people to add instructional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=810.224s">So</a>  we have been quietly working away over the years, and I just hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=817.187s">Uh,</a>  those of you at some time may consider giving a small contribution because it's always very, very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=827.591s">And</a>  I want to, uh, recognize as Councilor Marks did the current members on the board and to wish you good luck going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=842.377s">Thank</a>  you all very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=860.756s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=863.137s">I</a>  don't want to put you on the spot any longer, Mae, but I think a few of us just want to say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=867.7s">Councilman</a>  Marks did a great job announcing you and taking quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=873.323s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=875.33s">From</a>  my standpoint, you've been a true leader in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=878.971s">You've</a>  done such wonderful things that so many people have benefited from, families and every resident in this community has benefited from your work with the Chevalier and Cachet and everything else you were involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=892.013s">The</a>  fact that you did it because you love this city and you wanted to make it better means a lot and I look up to you, May, and I wish you the best and good luck in your retirement.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=900.134s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=902.935s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=904.836s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=905.879s">I</a>  want to also congratulate you, May. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=909.869s">I</a>  want to thank you for your energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=912.55s">Your</a>  selfless devotion to the city, your generosity to give of your spirit and your energy and yourself to so many commitments is tough, and we thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=927.837s">And</a>  I hope you keep going and going till you get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=932.219s">So</a>  keep at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=933.719s">Practice</a>  makes perfect.</p>

    <p>[0HXibsUvumY_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=935.0s">I'm</a>  not taking the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2018.723s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2019.503s">Mr.</a>  President, year after year, we have meetings with representatives and delegations from various public service organizations and non-profits who do business in our city and who benefit from these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2033.707s">The</a>  Office of Community Development goes to great lengths to accommodate and to disperse these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2041.105s">kind</a>  manner, and a great sense of concern is put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2048.026s">So</a>  in that light, and I must lament the possibility of diminishment of these fundings, but I move approval to the plan that's been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2059.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2060.648s">Councilor</a>  Nyth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2061.729s">Mr.</a>  President, I too support the plan that's been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2064.269s">The</a>  Office of Community Development has done an excellent job since my election to the council in explaining where these funds go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2070.012s">All</a>  the applicants come before the council at a committee of the whole meeting and pitch their case to request this funding as to why it would be good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2078.747s">Provided</a>  that there's nobody here in opposition, Mr. President, I move that we close the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2084.94s">Councilor</a>  Marks, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2087.401s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2089.002s">Lauren,</a>  are the human service groups made aware of what is happening?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2094.544s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2094.684s">Do</a>  we send a letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2095.664s">How</a>  are they made aware?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2097.965s">We've</a>  actually had a meeting with them before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2099.766s">We</a>  met with a committee, the whole of the city council had a meeting that we do with the senior center every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2105.108s">They're</a>  all invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2105.949s">They're</a>  told in that meeting notice, most of them come. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2108.55s">They're</a>  really supposed to all come. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2109.81s">A</a>  couple don't come, but they've all been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2112.341s">about</a>  what the status of it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2114.442s">And</a>  a lot of them actually have this similar problem where there are other funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2117.684s">So,</a>  yes, they all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2119.565s">When</a>  we will be waiting for the allocation, we won't make any announcements and there won't be any contracts executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2124.908s">We</a>  can't do that until HUD actually gives us the allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2127.77s">We</a>  submit our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2128.811s">It's</a>  approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2130.392s">And,</a>  you know, it's probably likely that money, if they move things along the way they're talking, would probably be available, I'm going to guess, sometime in August or late September. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2140.11s">They'll</a>  know we keep them informed and I think they all pretty much know they're suffering the similar problems with other funding sources as I said.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2147.115s">So</a>  has any group mentioned that because of maybe staff hiring or other employee issues that there may be a concern if they don't get the funding from day one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2158.163s">They</a>  have not raised those issues to us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2159.984s">There's</a>  been no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2161.625s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2163.246s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehnan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2164.507s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2167.249s">Thank</a>  you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2169.848s">with</a>  regards to the allocation portion of it, nobody's going to be cut out? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2173.452s">Is</a>  it just going to be if we receive 10% less? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2175.995s">Everybody,</a>  how would it be broken down?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2178.398s">So</a>  the maximum we can fund is 15% of the total allocation, and the table you see there, and I want to clarify a couple things for you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2185.92s">The</a>  table you see there allocating $210,000 is if we get level funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2190.184s">So</a>  the way I'm proposing is that we would increase these agencies up to a maximum of 15% if the allocation increases and decrease them proportionally if the allocation is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2199.751s">There</a>  are two things, two changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2201.052s">The</a>  Medford Housing Authority did not receive money last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2203.875s">They</a>  applied for money, about $8,000 to hire or actually pay a stipend to someone to provide <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2210.446s">language</a>  translation services at the walking court development for people who are Haitian. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2215.789s">And</a>  honestly, in order for us to fund it, number one, we don't know if we're going to get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2220.151s">Number</a>  two, we'd have to cut our other agency by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2222.372s">So</a>  to give them a token amount we didn't think would really be beneficial, and we'd have to cut another agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2227.574s">And</a>  a couple of these agencies are receiving under a couple of thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2231.196s">Salvation</a>  Army is an agency that did apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2233.517s">Last</a>  year, Salvation Army was the agency with all the resources that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2238.081s">You</a>  know, under a couple of thousand dollars that they get from us, they returned back money last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2242.585s">They</a>  have very stringent, how do I want to say, intentions about the person that we deal with, intentions about how they want to distribute the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2252.813s">And</a>  so again, we've already heard that they may not spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2255.155s">And</a>  this is very emergency assistance money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2257.237s">So</a>  we made a recommendation to the mayor, which she agreed was to allocate that to another agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2263.082s">And</a>  you will see that we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2265.9s">suggested</a>  that the community family which provides Alzheimer assistance and subsidizes the tuition or the fees for a Medford resident or more than one resident, if there's money available, they receive $1,745. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2279.066s">We've</a>  recommended they go up to $2,907. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2282.427s">And</a>  then we'll, you know, as we can, if we can, poke down to get some of these other agencies that are under a couple thousand dollars up in the future that we hope to try to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2292.572s">So</a>  that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2293.672s">So,</a>  yes, Medford Housing Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2296.249s">which</a>  never has not received money into public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2299.33s">And</a>  then salvation army was eliminated on the fact that they did not spend their money last year and are not on target to spend it again this year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2306.891s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2307.211s">So</a>  that explains why the two aren't in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2309.492s">And</a>  then if we did get 15% more, these one to 10, 15, um, agencies will get 15% more across the board.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2319.634s">If</a>  it was 15, it would be 15.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2320.354s">If</a>  it was 10, 10% cut, they'd be 10% cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2323.62s">what</a>  I'm getting at is none will get changed drastically depending. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2326.902s">It</a>  depends.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2327.762s">It</a>  depends on, we could get no funding and then they will get nothing and we will get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2332.964s">So,</a>  but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2335.345s">Well,</a>  we have to trust still in the system of government that we have and that that won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2340.188s">Um,</a>  so yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2341.868s">So</a>  that's why we do support everybody, uh, basically letting know their elected officials know the importance of this program and advocating for it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2349.052s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2349.512s">And</a>  then my last question would just be just to give us a, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2352.685s">a</a>  brief summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2353.445s">I</a>  mean, people at home should know a little bit of where this money's going, how much we have as a total, and where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2360.148s">So</a>  if you could give us a brief summary, that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2361.929s">So</a>  the total amount of money that we're estimating, again, it's an estimate, is $1,403,210. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2368.151s">We're</a>  allocating, we're proposing $20,000 for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2370.712s">We</a>  have some existing housing money, so that's not all the money that we have for housing resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2375.354s">We're</a>  also eligible to access money with non-profit agencies through the city's relationship with the North Suburban Consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2383.053s">Economic</a>  development, $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2384.514s">As</a>  you see, we talked about the storefront program and economic development strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2388.815s">We</a>  still have some money from this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2390.236s">We</a>  have not implemented that storefront program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2392.136s">So</a>  we have money from this year, and we have money going forward if this is funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2397.118s">Public</a>  services, you cannot carry money over from one year to the next on public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2402.04s">So</a>  that $210,000 would be the max, and that's contingent on that allocation number that I told you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2407.708s">And</a>  those go to a variety of agencies, people working with after-school programs to English language classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2418.371s">The</a>  senior center here in Medford receives a good portion of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2423.573s">SCM</a>  Community Transportation is an agency that also is well-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2427.394s">We</a>  have an agency that provides housing counseling services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2431.835s">Actually,</a>  I shouldn't use housing counseling services anymore because HUD has now defined that strictly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2436.183s">housing</a>  referral agencies and advocacy and protection for people who are going through evictions and things like that, representation in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2443.673s">So,</a>  and we also have funding that goes to EMARC and I think the, not I think, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2451.317s">the</a>  Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2452.538s">So</a>  those are generally the kind of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2454.159s">They're</a>  a wide range of very important services that assist Medford's low and moderate income populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2459.962s">And</a>  planning and admin goes for any kind of study that's related to the CDBG program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2464.505s">It</a>  might be fair housing if that's what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2466.686s">We</a>  help pay toward the city's single audit for the portion of our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2470.729s">It</a>  also funds the majority of the staff costs in our office and a portion of the diversity director's office.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2483.054s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2484.976s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2671.554s">Uh,</a>  the reason, the first reason is going to be that we request to be two signs <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2677.424s">because</a>  of the large size of the building and directions of the street that whoever's coming into one side of the building, we're not going to be able to see the other side of the building, which the client has the top, the whole top corner of the entire building as his business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2695.908s">And</a>  we require to be, we're being required by the inspector to be more darker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2701.289s">So</a>  we put the box itself to be brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2704.09s">So</a>  we match with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2705.879s">and</a>  the colors to be plain with the colors of our nation, which is red, white, and blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2712.142s">And</a>  plain and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2713.683s">And</a>  we also had an issue that we unfortunately made a mistake putting the lettering on the windows that without the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2722.107s">And</a>  then we've been fined. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2724.288s">We</a>  paid the fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2726.048s">And</a>  now the client agreed to remove the logos from the windows because we are going to be putting the signs up in approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2734.392s">But</a>  he also wanted to request, if it's possible, there is a possibility to keep the lettering over the surface that he presents on the glasses, which is already on the copy that you guys probably have it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2752.183s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I am objecting to the, is this illuminated sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2758.607s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2759.708s">First</a>  of all, I'm objecting to the sign being illuminated in the middle of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2763.607s">And</a>  I'm objecting to, it doesn't fit, I don't think, with the rest of the signs in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2769.75s">I</a>  know it's oversized, but if you could letter it on the building, I think it would look a lot better than an illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2775.573s">I</a>  mean, this is a sign that you see in a strip mall, not in the middle of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2779.155s">And</a>  here we are, we're trying to revive Medford Square and make it look a little more pleasurable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2784.758s">I</a>  don't feel that that type of sign represents what I'd like to see in Medford Square or many of the other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2791.105s">That</a>  would be my request, if you could letter the building similar to like, if you see in your pictures here, similar to like the other buildings have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2801.674s">That's</a>  my request, and not have it illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2804.197s">That</a>  would be my request to you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2815.368s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2817.23s">As</a>  we go through our packet this evening, we'll see that there are two requests for sign reversals related to 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2822.976s">And</a>  I think if both petitions before the council this evening were approved, it would be ugly is the best word that I can come up with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2832.845s">I</a>  don't think it really fits in with the character of the neighborhood based upon <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2835.875s">Um,</a>  the total number of signs that are being presented tonight and the location thereof, uh, all in the same building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2842.678s">Um,</a>  I certainly can agree with Councilor Caraviello's position that, uh, an illuminated sign wouldn't fit in with the quality, um, in criteria that's down in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2850.762s">Um,</a>  personally, Mr. President, I think the best course of action would be to have this matter referred to our subcommittee on signs, uh, for further review and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2857.465s">Uh,</a>  I don't think that this is something that, um, when, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2861.43s">partnered</a>  with the other matter that's before us is going to be beneficial to the revitalization of our downtown of Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2867.192s">I</a>  think it's going to, uh, be an eyesore more or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2869.573s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2870.833s">So</a>  on the motion of council night to refer this matter, uh, to the, uh, sign committee seconded by president Caraviello chair recognizes councilor marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2881.616s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2881.996s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2883.617s">Um,</a>  I think what we're seeing here tonight is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2888.457s">based</a>  on the location of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2891.158s">So</a>  if you look at the picture that we have on the paper we received, the building is located partially on Forest Street and partially on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2902.22s">So</a>  for all intents and purposes, it's like this building has two fronting facades. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2907.662s">And</a>  I think that's what at least this petition is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2912.003s">I</a>  don't agree with the illuminated signs, and I think this council has been on record, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2917.16s">not</a>  supporting illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2918.802s">Uh,</a>  however, the, uh, the type of sign and the number of signs I have no problem with, uh, based on what I believe, uh, is the hardship of having your main entrance on high street and, uh, the rest of your building, uh, on forestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2937.418s">And</a>  that to me proposes a hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2940.921s">And</a>  I think the additional signage <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2942.878s">is</a>  warranted in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2945.539s">So</a>  I don't agree with my other colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2948.041s">Uh,</a>  the only thing I do agree with is the fact that, uh, I don't support the internally illuminated, uh, portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2955.104s">Uh,</a>  if it's, if it's the druthers of the council to send this to the sign committee, I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2961.047s">I'm</a>  not quite sure what we're going to accomplish there that we couldn't accomplish right now with the party before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2967.27s">If</a>  there's recommendations, you know, if the party agrees upon them now, I don't see why we have to have a subcommittee meeting on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2976.592s">Those</a>  are my thoughts, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2978.612s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2979.513s">And</a>  as chairman of the Business and Economic Development and Science Committee, also with myself and Councilor Scarpelli, we'll, once we finish with debate on this matter, we'll take the vote on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2994.896s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=2998.834s">If</a>  I can, I know with the denial of the signs, I think that if you look at the rest of the square, and keeping with the theme that we have right now, if you look across the street, I don't disagree with Council Marks and the petitioner looking for the number of signs, but if you look at the way that Andre Realty <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3020.237s">did</a>  what they did across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3021.658s">They</a>  have multiple signs, but the way they addressed it, it fits the look of the square where it's not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3029.145s">And</a>  they added decorative lights around it that shows that would like the sign, but at the same time keeps the same appeal and routine throughout our <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3043.372s">our</a>  business community in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3047.254s">So</a>  I'm not a fan of the lit sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3053.958s">If</a>  you look across the other businesses in the square, I think you could see that it's tasteful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3062.315s">And</a>  with the different forms of lighting, I think you can accommodate what you're looking for to illuminate your sign with what the neighboring businesses have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3071.643s">So</a>  I too will not support the illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3075.566s">I</a>  will entertain a few different signs locations because it does wrap around so I can understand that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3084.593s">But</a>  again, I will not support the big illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3091.197s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3094.318s">Thank</a>  you, President, Councilor De La Ruzo, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3099.061s">With</a>  regards to the science, were awnings discussed at all?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3105.044s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3107.065s">We</a>  thought about it, but we thought that would be more complicated to get approval on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3112.307s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, Nick, I am trying to hear out what my council colleagues are saying, and you did attach, oh, actually, Wayside, which is the next petitioner, did attach <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3121.7s">signs</a>  from across the street, which are much more expensive signs and obviously very nice character for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3128.462s">But</a>  I understand that not everybody can afford that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3130.703s">And</a>  at the same token, where these two businesses are, you do have awnings at the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3137.685s">So</a>  maybe even that would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3139.585s">Something</a>  like that would be a little in-between resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3143.566s">And</a>  I'm not sure if it will help all my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3146.727s">But</a>  I just was curious if that was discussed at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3149.564s">That</a>  is a tough location to have a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3151.785s">The</a>  parking is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3152.825s">So</a>  I do see the need for a sign on each street, forest, and high. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3159.468s">So</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3160.488s">So</a>  I think we're almost along the same lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3162.729s">But</a>  whether or not you want to take it back and do a redesign to appease all the Councilors or get two signs with no illumination, I think it's kind of up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3176.125s">because</a>  I do like what's across the street better, but at the same token, I understand that's probably much more pricey and there are awnings and different wall stickers on the building you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3185.629s">So</a>  I mean, business has to do what they can afford, although it would be nice to have some conformity.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3198.095s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3199.336s">I'm</a>  reviewing the documents here and I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3206.464s">And</a>  when I look at the signs in the square, the other thing that I like, and we're trying to, I think in many ways, the community is trying to rebrand Medford Square because we're trying to bring business in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3217.012s">And</a>  when I look at these signs in other businesses, everything seems to be very uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3222.896s">It's</a>  all on the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3224.997s">If</a>  I take a look at the sign, your sign, and then I take a look at Wayside, you know, Wayside <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3232.244s">seems</a>  to be in line with the rest of the businesses and you're popping up in the air a bit, you know, which seems kind of, just seems out of whack kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3240.608s">I</a>  mean, it seems like, you know, it doesn't seem that clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3244.15s">It</a>  just seems like it would be nice if you could kind of get everything in one uniform way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3249.232s">But</a>  I will admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3253.094s">Is</a>  there any flexibility on that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3254.354s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3256.896s">I</a>  actually have a question right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3260.217s">What</a>  about, I'm just counting here, it looks like we have six sets of windows up in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3266.778s">Would</a>  it be allowed, you guys, would it allow if we present to the client to be awnings instead?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3277.461s">You</a>  want to, I'm sorry, you want to put awnings in the place of the sign?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3281.402s">Awnings</a>  on top of each window. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3284.142s">On</a>  top of the windows at the very top? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3286.243s">At</a>  the very top, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3287.928s">Perhaps</a>  we could do like red and then with the white, just white letters, global healthcare.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3294.551s">I'm</a>  wondering if that needs to be discussed with your client and perhaps the property owner.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3303.256s">To</a>  the point of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3305.66s">when</a>  I raised the issue of referring it to the subcommittee, my intention was to do so so that we could get both petitioners wayside and global health services together in the same room and they could make a joint presentation to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3315.747s">It</a>  looks like it would be something that would fit more within the quality and character of the neighborhood was the way that I was thinking that it was going to work.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3321.992s">That's</a>  how I took your motion to be attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3327.215s">Councilor</a>  Falco, you still have floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3329.757s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3330.217s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3330.638s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3331.365s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Caraviello, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3336.788s">All</a>  those in favor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3338.849s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3341.67s">Please</a>  record me in opposition to this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3344.431s">I</a>  do not support the illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3346.633s">sign,</a>  but I do support moving forward with the signage on both Forest and High Street because of the hardship the petitioner has.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3355.376s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3356.437s">On</a>  that motion and recognizing Councilor Mark's opposition, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3361.919s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3363.119s">The</a>  ayes have it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3367.421s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3369.302s">Similar</a>  matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3372.543s">It's</a>  going to sound like the same exact conversation I think we just had.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3375.404s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3376.305s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take 17451 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3381.908s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3382.748s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3385.009s">17451,</a>  petition for sign denial reversal by Richard DiTullio, property manager for Wayside Youth and Family, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3392.633s">OCD</a>  application 2017-11A exceeds allowable size, secondary sign, and window signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3402.42s">Is</a>  the petitioner present? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3403.821s">If</a>  you are, please present yourself to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3406.041s">State</a>  your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3410.462s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3410.903s">My</a>  name's Richard DiTullio, property manager with Wayside Youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3415.604s">I'm</a>  here with the owner of the sign company, Rachel O'Donoghue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3419.945s">How</a>  do you do?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3421.906s">First,</a>  I just want to be clear that this gentleman's property is on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3429.028s">We're</a>  aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3430.63s">Okay,</a>  so is he looking to put a sign adjacent to ours on the ground floor?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3436.231s">Isn't</a>  this space for the first floor tenant?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3439.752s">That's</a>  up to the landlord, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3457.353s">No</a>  wonder they said no, because we're asking to put the sign in that panel.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3461.015s">Yeah,</a>  I can see we have a kind of a collision there of signs.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3464.858s">It</a>  would seem, and I think the sentiments of the council with us, with the approval of that previous motion, that the wise thing to do would be to meet in committee to where <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3478.426s">The</a>  proceedings can be a little more conversational, that charts and designs can be exchanged, an assessment of what the ordinances are can also be substantiated by the OCD director or the building inspector, and I think we can come to some conclusions in that forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3503.686s">But</a>  you have the floor, so if you would present your matter to us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3508.908s">Well,</a>  what we had hoped to do was on the ground floor, we had planned on putting two signs above the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3518.771s">One</a>  of the signs has been approved by the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3523.672s">That</a>  sign is in production. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3525.413s">It's</a>  a non-illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3528.214s">It's</a>  a white background, green lettering, with our company logo, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3535.777s">What</a>  we had wanted to do in our application was add a second sign, again, because of the wrap onto Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3544.78s">In</a>  addition to that, we wanted to put three signs in the window itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3552.284s">The</a>  addition of the sign that the tenant up on the second floor has is a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3557.308s">And</a>  again, we can understand why it looks very busy with signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3564.023s">So</a>  we're, you know, we're, we're a, uh, not for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3567.524s">We've</a>  been around for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3568.924s">We</a>  hope to, uh, do well in the Medford area.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3572.685s">Um,</a>  and, uh, and, and the council understands for both entities, the importance of, uh, having signs, uh, on a place of, uh, business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3583.608s">Uh,</a>  so, uh, we're aware of that and, uh, hope to expedite this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3589.089s">Uh,</a>  but, uh, the chair awaits motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3593.897s">committee</a>  on science, business and economic development on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3597.178s">A</a>  chair recognizes a president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3599.939s">Carve</a>  yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3600.42s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3600.96s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3601.54s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3602.12s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3603.861s">Mr.</a>  President record me in opposition based on the fact that, um, this business as well as the prior business owner has the same hardship being located at a very busy intersection on two major roads in the square and the additional signage, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3620.49s">is</a>  warranted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3622.392s">And,</a>  you know, after discussing for many years how dark Medford Square is, maybe we should start looking at internally illuminated signs to help out with the brightness in the square, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3635.584s">And,</a>  you know, maybe that's something that's needed in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3639.567s">So</a>  record me in opposition based on those facts.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3642.67s">The</a>  President Very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3646.91s">Perhaps</a>  I might say from the chair that externally illuminated signs might achieve the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3651.874s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, understanding that Councilor Marks wishes to be marked in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3659.119s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President, uh, uh, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3664.443s">I</a>  also want to be recorded in opposition with regards to the two signs for the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3669.239s">front</a>  of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3670.06s">I</a>  think that's like I said in the last petition, I think that's necessary for this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3675.165s">So</a>  I just want to be recorded in opposition for those two signs.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3679.209s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3680.31s">On</a>  the motion, uh, councilor Scarpelli, right?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3684.794s">I</a>  think the, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3686.448s">The</a>  biggest confusion right now is the muddy water now with the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3691.192s">So</a>  I don't, if you came to us with this being the only issue with two signs, I would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3696.496s">But</a>  with the other signs, one going above it, now in my mind to prove that and then possibly have that as an option later, I can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3707.725s">So</a>  I would go with the subcommittee so we can talk this out and listen to the <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3713.783s">you</a>  know, what the landlord has to say and then, you know, and find some other solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3718.365s">But</a>  when the time comes, I definitely support the two sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3721.787s">I</a>  think that's going to be needed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3723.167s">Typically,</a>  though, wouldn't the second floor tenant be limited to his window space?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3728.97s">Again,</a>  we don't know for the fact that it's a landlord issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3731.951s">That's</a>  not with us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3735.073s">I</a>  mean, you're probably paying the prime rate because you're on the first floor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3741.903s">Obviously,</a>  there's a solution here, and the Councilors want to get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3746.326s">All</a>  set, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3747.587s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3747.987s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3749.348s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3750.889s">I</a>  agree with my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3753.871s">I</a>  actually have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3755.512s">I</a>  actually like the signs, and I think they're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3758.174s">There</a>  is some confusion, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3759.234s">If</a>  you look at these two pictures, all these signs are in the same spot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3762.877s">I</a>  wasn't aware of that, because they're renting the first floor, so I assumed that the façade belonged to the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3770.954s">I</a>  didn't even know there was somebody else moving in there that they were looking for signs.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3774.416s">But</a>  like I said, I have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3777.119s">I</a>  think the signs look fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3778.68s">They're</a>  very professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3780.061s">They're</a>  not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3781.022s">They're</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3783.264s">I</a>  just think going to subcommittee, I think we'll hopefully resolve some issues, clear things up, and then come before us again.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3795.525s">Mr.</a>  Chair, we request a meeting relatively quick because I know the hardship here, so it wouldn't be something waiting weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3801.847s">I'd</a>  like to get this done as soon as possible if we can.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3978.02s">Mr.</a>  President, I have no objection to this request to move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3983.933s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3998.019s">If</a>  I can, I just, with the recent concerns that we've had in that area with traffic issues, I think, would this sign be too big for, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4012.328s">and</a>  for public safety in the sense that for the traffic and deterring of drivers, I think that that's one of the most dangerous areas we've heard in a long time on this council with that corner and being such a encompassing sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4035.763s">I</a>  question whether that might be <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4039.038s">a</a>  little too large and a little deterrent for the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4043.52s">I</a>  know we want to bring light to your church and I applaud it, but at the same time, I think public safety has to be addressed in the sense that it's really, it's, you know, I don't know if you've been familiar with that area, with the Brooks School, with the traffic, with the speed of 30 miles an hour, people being, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4067.098s">deterred</a>  to look at such a daunting sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4070.401s">I</a>  don't know if I can support that.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4072.903s">And</a>  that's what we were thinking about, is having people actually reading the sign as they were driving, because we figured if the sign <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4083.347s">is</a>  too small, they won't be able to read it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4086.328s">Because</a>  the current sign that we have right now is a six by seven sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4091.229s">And</a>  for the past couple of years, we actually have had a summer festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4097.61s">And</a>  people can't even read the sign that we had right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4101.551s">The</a>  day of the festival, people will stop by because they see activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4105.532s">And</a>  they come in, they're like, oh, I didn't even see the sign that you have right now, because it's too far back from the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4111.153s">And</a>  the current sign that we have right now will be in the same position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4114.917s">So</a>  we figured people will still kind of, maybe because it's back there with the light, they will probably see it back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4122.905s">And</a>  we have a big tree, like a huge tree, two big trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4126.908s">I</a>  don't know if you guys have ever seen that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4129.791s">Huge</a>  tree in the summer, in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4132.053s">You</a>  can even see the current sign that we have back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4135.696s">We</a>  figured maybe with a little light, they may even see a little bit of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4141.0s">That's</a>  why we requested that size, a five by eight or four by eight, maybe, will be like a, it's even a smaller size than the one that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4152.91s">We</a>  figured maybe with a little light, it might be a little bit better.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4156.772s">Now,</a>  if I recall, you also hang banners off that sign.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4160.393s">Yeah,</a>  and they can't see it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4163.414s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4163.674s">Well,</a>  this is pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4167.295s">You're</a>  talking over 11 feet high from ground to the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4173.157s">Were</a>  there any other sizes discussed?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4175.458s">Yeah,</a>  the 4x8. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4178.098s">The</a>  current sign that you guys denied, that's a 5x8. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4185.007s">The</a>  CD, I'm sorry, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4187.309s">The</a>  CD had denied was the five by eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4189.87s">And</a>  on the appeal letter, I have mentioned the four by eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4194.653s">It's</a>  actually was cheaper for us anyway, because yeah, it was the four by eight was a cheaper price for the pastor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4202.778s">So</a>  we had asked the sign company if it would do that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4210.663s">He</a>  says yes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4220.843s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4223.485s">Vice</a>  President Marx. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4225.327s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4227.989s">The</a>  current sign is from the ground up five by eight, correct?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4235.174s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4235.895s">The</a>  current sign is six by seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4237.996s">Six</a>  by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4239.157s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4240.158s">You've</a>  mentioned five different sizes so far, just so you know.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4244.441s">The</a>  current size is six by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4246.483s">Six</a>  by seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4247.244s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4249.463s">we</a>  call the original that the church used to use.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4252.244s">The</a>  one that's currently on the lawn now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4253.845s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4254.445s">It's</a>  six by seven?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4255.546s">Six</a>  by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4257.606s">And</a>  it's not elevated on a platform, it's on the ground, six by seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4262.288s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4263.129s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4263.809s">So</a>  is there any way that we can bring this sign, because if you look at your top signage, it's very close to conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4273.553s">When</a>  you add in the pedestal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4276.125s">That's</a>  what blows this sign way out of proportion, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4280.447s">Is</a>  there any way we can bring that down a little further and shrink the signage similar to what is out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4287.23s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4287.71s">I</a>  have no problem making it a little larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4290.332s">I</a>  like the colors of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4291.672s">I</a>  think it's a very nice sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4293.573s">I</a>  think it's a nice looking sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4295.314s">And</a>  I think it matches the area of what you're doing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4299.156s">But</a>  I think the fact that you're <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4303.06s">podium</a>  that it sits on, or base, is three feet six inches alone, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4309.592s">And</a>  then you have your sign sitting above that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4311.152s">It</a>  makes it look like a real giant sign, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4315.993s">And</a>  maybe if we're able to downsize that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4319.854s">And</a>  I have no problem making it larger than what the current ordinance calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4324.675s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4325.055s">I</a>  have no problem making it a little larger than that, because your church is set back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4329.435s">And</a>  I think this sign does represent, hey, we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4333.936s">And</a>  I agree with that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4335.416s">So</a>  if, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4336.797s">If</a>  I can interrupt you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4340.018s">The</a>  zoning board denied the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4343.06s">They</a>  didn't deny this sign, they denied another sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4346.624s">So</a>  I think the first one she mentioned was the five foot sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4350.447s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4351.008s">That</a>  was the one denied, so now they're proposing a different sign than what was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4357.454s">So</a>  this is a whole different sign than what was denied.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4361.377s">So</a>  this wasn't the sign that was denied? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4364.748s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4365.689s">The</a>  5-8.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4366.529s">The</a>  5-8 was denied, so this one here would have to go through the process all over again, am I correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4372.193s">So</a>  which one's the 5-8, the one on the second page? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4374.555s">It's</a>  not even here.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4375.555s">It's</a>  not even here.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4377.897s">So</a>  again, this... The 5-8 was the one that was denied, so what we're saying is we can have a smaller size.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4385.823s">But</a>  that's the one that you're appealing.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4387.964s">That's</a>  the one we're appealing, the 5-8.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4390.206s">So</a>  this one here doesn't even come into play.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4392.802s">The</a>  5'8"?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4393.462s">No,</a>  this one here, this picture that you're showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4396.464s">This</a>  is 8 by 11.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4397.544s">Oh,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4399.185s">That's</a>  the 5'8 I made copies of.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4402.906s">That</a>  wasn't the 5'8 I made copies of? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4404.167s">This</a>  looks a little bit bigger than the 5'8. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4405.507s">No,</a>  that's why, the 5'8 we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4407.408s">This</a>  is 11 feet high.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4408.669s">They're</a>  saying there's a six foot tall man here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4412.19s">Oh,</a>  gosh, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4413.551s">No,</a>  no, that's not it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4415.131s">That's</a>  5'8. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4415.431s">The</a>  one we're looking to put there is four.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4420.004s">4</a>  by 5.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4420.244s">If</a>  you eliminated the pedestal, it would be like half size. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4422.825s">Can</a>  we see that one?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4425.086s">Hang</a>  on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4426.266s">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4427.787s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4427.947s">So</a>  where did this come from?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4428.967s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4429.688s">Where</a>  did this come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4432.689s">I...</a>  The city didn't make this up for you, did they? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4434.81s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4436.89s">It's</a>  a handsome six foot gentleman though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4438.491s">No,</a>  no, no, but the one that...</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4445.601s">The</a>  one that I sent to them.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4447.002s">Do</a>  you have a picture you could pass around to the council?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4449.624s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4451.405s">No,</a>  I think that's the one that I... Eight by 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4456.089s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's the one that I sent.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4458.891s">Mr.</a>  President, we might as well refer to this.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4460.172s">Because</a>  you have the five by eight, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4462.273s">Is</a>  that the one you have?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4462.994s">Yeah,</a>  why don't you do that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4464.055s">We</a>  have eight by 11.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4465.616s">Oh,</a>  no, that's the one that I meant to send. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4467.837s">No,</a>  that's the one we have.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4470.039s">No,</a>  we don't have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4472.201s">We</a>  don't have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4473.301s">It's</a>  the same one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4474.402s">It's</a>  the same one, right?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4475.743s">It's</a>  the same exact one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4479.464s">Mr.</a>  President, can we refer this to the subcommittee as well, so we can clarify this?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4483.465s">We're</a>  gonna meet very shortly, so yeah.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4486.326s">Might</a>  as well refer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4487.947s">We're</a>  gonna meet very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4490.768s">Seeing</a>  that we have some confusion here with the petitioner, I'm gonna ask that we take the suggestion that this be referred to the subcommittee also.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4499.631s">No,</a>  it's the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4500.191s">Second,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4501.331s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4502.692s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4505.125s">We</a>  didn't deny anything.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4506.546s">No,</a>  I, I give you guys the motion by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4511.75s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4518.776s">We</a>  now decide to buy the side at four by eight, not even five by eight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4527.283s">But</a>  there seems to be some confusion in the size of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4531.626s">I</a>  think in the subcommittee it would be a lot easier getting it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4534.876s">If</a>  we can, we'll say, the setting is a little bit more informal, and I think everyone will know exactly what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4542.422s">We're</a>  gonna take Councilor Knight's motion to refer this to subcommittees, seconded by... Yes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4557.067s">What</a>  we're doing is we're gonna call for a meeting relatively quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4561.128s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4562.008s">Hopefully</a>  by next Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4563.429s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4563.709s">So</a>  we can see the five foot sign, even the five foot by eight foot sign, and we can talk about that in subcommittee and then bring it back out to the floor if everything works out so we can have this done by next week.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4577.193s">Okay,</a>  so put some paperwork back to John.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4579.133s">Right,</a>  just so we can see it, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4580.574s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4580.814s">But</a>  please remember that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4581.614s">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4582.514s">Bring</a>  a picture of the sign that you asked for originally.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4584.415s">Just</a>  bring it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4586.288s">Just</a>  bring that to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4587.289s">Our</a>  city clerk will contact you when we have that subcommittee meeting and you could bring those designs to us for what was denied and we can reverse that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4596.859s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4597.399s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4598.04s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott-Pelley. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4602.004s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4603.505s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4605.127s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4605.527s">While</a>  we're under suspension, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4609.018s">Paper</a>  in the hand of the clerk, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4613.4s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South Street and Walnut Street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4629.467s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4630.821s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4632.762s">I'm</a>  just looking for an update, maybe from the Medford Police Department, as well as the mayor's office, the administration, with regards to permits being pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4642.566s">I've</a>  received a few text messages, an email, two phone calls, and a Facebook message with regards to residents being upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4652.59s">There</a>  were handwritten letters all around Walnut Street and South Street saying, do not park <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4661.343s">on</a>  Walnut and South, I believe it was sometime today until five o'clock tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4666.884s">It</a>  said violators will be towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4669.605s">Now</a>  residents who live on South and Walnut and obviously have to park there through the night, tonight, were a little upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4679.567s">Most</a>  people didn't even call me first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4681.668s">They</a>  called the mayor's office, the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4684.569s">Everybody's</a>  giving everybody just different information with regards to what's going on, why is there no parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4690.973s">And</a>  then it became an issue with regards to, is this even being done legally? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4695.894s">Were</a>  the permits pulled? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4697.714s">I</a>  didn't talk to any of the police department yet, but I have heard through the grapevine that no permits were pulled to post those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4705.395s">From</a>  what I understand, there is modular homes that were planned on coming down south and looping around down the one way down to Walnut to place the two modular homes on two, obviously, foundations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4720.346s">So</a>  after collecting all of the information today and trying to piece together the puzzle, catch up on what I had missed after work, it was a little late and I'm bringing it up tonight, a little late to call people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4732.15s">I</a>  think I got the last of my information about 6.30 this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4736.052s">So</a>  if we could, as a council, get some updates because there are angry residents, people who are now upset because they feel like it was done incorrectly, to put it lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4751.754s">And</a>  from what I understand, there were no permits pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4755.318s">To</a>  bring modular homes, which are very large, pre-FAB homes, down two streets, down a one-way, you need detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4762.085s">And</a>  from what I understand, our police department knew nothing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4766.309s">Details</a>  weren't hired, and permits were not pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4770.193s">I</a>  also, from what I understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4772.063s">didn't</a>  get a chance to contact the mayor's office, but a lot of the residents did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4775.745s">And</a>  the mayor's office may have been lied to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4778.246s">I'm</a>  not quite sure of the full story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4780.407s">So</a>  if we could get an update with regards to what permits were pulled, if they weren't pulled for today, were they pulled for a different day? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4788.291s">When</a>  is this going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4792.313s">How</a>  long is this going to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4794.174s">How</a>  many detail will we have present? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4795.915s">There's</a>  obviously a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4798.016s">There's</a>  a parking issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4799.037s">People</a>  want to be able to park in their own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4802.159s">Medcalf</a>  Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4803.92s">So</a>  we really want to get an idea of, so we can be able to respond to all the residents on those two streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4811.286s">South</a>  is a very long street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4812.887s">And</a>  people were really, really upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4815.149s">It</a>  affected, I think it went public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4818.611s">So</a>  people all over the community were really upset with what went on and how somebody's allowed to get away with basically lying to the neighborhood if it was so a lie and there were no permits pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4829.039s">So</a>  I, as one, want to get <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4830.681s">it</a>  all taken care of, if this is gonna happen down the road, we wanna make sure permits are pulled, details in place, and the neighborhood is maybe given advance notice, two, three hour notice to not park or else you're gonna be towed, and a handwritten note, really concern people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4846.185s">So</a>  if we could get an update from the police department, our chief of police, or traffic division, as well as the mayor's office, I think that's necessary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4856.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4856.768s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4857.888s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4859.516s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Langelkern for bringing this up, but I think if we can add something, an amendment to this, that we also look into how we distribute signs and who distributes signs for the city during traffic and parking for other issues and concerns in the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4879.388s">I</a>  know that I did talk to a contractor today who said that they actually <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4886.244s">do</a>  this in other areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4888.665s">And</a>  there's really not a department that they can go to that has these signs when they legitimately close the street down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4896.168s">And</a>  they actually use City of Boston signs and cross out Boston, put in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4902.03s">So</a>  if we can get some information back from, I don't know if it's the engineering department, if it's the DPW, but if we can get some guidance there, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4926.228s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4927.429s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4929.23s">I</a>  did see a couple of versions of the sign that was supposed to close the street down, and residents were going back and forth, and I received a message from a friend asking me if this was a real sign, because people weren't sure if it was a real sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4943.987s">And</a>  if they had to stop parking there at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4946.148s">today</a>  till 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4947.409s">tomorrow,</a>  that was certainly a hardship for people that live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4950.911s">And</a>  who wants to try to rearrange your life if it's not a real sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4955.473s">So</a>  I did, in fact, go in person to the mayor's office, and I was helped by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4961.596s">Lauren</a>  Felch, who was extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4963.937s">She</a>  pulled up the flyer, she called the developer, or who she believes was the developer, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4971.281s">It</a>  was the number on the flyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4972.563s">It</a>  was not a city number and was told that in fact they had gotten all the permissions that they needed and that the home would be being moved tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4980.793s">And</a>  it would be coming in at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4983.155s">She</a>  asked him why. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4984.926s">People</a>  weren't allowed to park there at 5 p.m., and he wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=4988.729s">When</a>  she concluded the call, I asked her if it was possible if she could confirm that there were permissions granted, and if there were permissions, if the city could send out a reverse 911 call, because it was really important that people knew that this really was happening, and this wasn't a sign, a fake sign that had been put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5006.384s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5006.724s">Felch</a>  had expressed that a year prior, someone had put up signs that said street cleaning was happening in some neighborhood that were handwritten, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5013.77s">And</a>  people had moved and it turned out to not be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5016.032s">So</a>  she understood that a lot of people probably wouldn't believe this was a real sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5020.635s">The</a>  last information that I received when she called back after she had called various offices was that the project was halted for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5029.322s">So</a>  anyone that lives in that area can park in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5032.805s">They'll</a>  be able to go to work in the morning because the house is not being moved now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5037.248s">It's</a>  my understanding that this is not the first home that he has moved in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5041.391s">So</a>  I'm curious to know if he's violating some sort of rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5044.853s">Is</a>  there a department that's supposed to oversee when these homes are being moved, if streets are being closed off? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5052.158s">Is</a>  safety being factored in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5053.599s">Had</a>  this home been moving through the neighborhood at 7 o'clock in the morning, school children would be out and about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5059.222s">People</a>  would be trying to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5060.904s">People</a>  would be going into their cars to get out of their driveway and find out that they can't leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5066.507s">And</a>  if this has happened before and we didn't know about it shame on us So I hope that you all can look into it and find out what the process is This developer does own two to three more parcels in the city planning on doing similar things to those parcels So it'd be great if he could have a plan From the city on exactly what he is supposed to do step by step before he moves a modular home into our community So that we don't have someone get hurt or miss work or or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5095.233s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5095.773s">Thank</a>  you <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5098.521s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5100.526s">Gene</a>  Duzo, 35 Power Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5102.933s">So</a>  I've been following this issue on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5106.805s">And</a>  I think that what we have here is a systematic issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5113.148s">And</a>  this all stems back, in my opinion, to the fact that these individuals coming into our city to flip properties are not encouraged nor are they required to engage with the neighborhoods that they're working in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5128.955s">Because</a>  they know they'll go to our ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5131.276s">They'll</a>  get whatever their variances are regardless of what our residents have to say and This is just a complete Lack of respect for the people in the neighborhood, you know working in the industry If you asked anybody who is truly involved in the industry and not someone who's just flipping properties, but large-scale developers commercial high-end residential large-scale residential <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5158.123s">They</a>  wouldn't dream of doing something like this without some type of community meeting to advise people of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5165.146s">They</a>  wouldn't come down these streets without the proper details in place and logistics in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5172.508s">And</a>  I'm not speaking specifically about this developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5176.77s">I'm</a>  speaking in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5179.291s">If</a>  you walk around and you speak with people, this is happening everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5183.392s">Folks</a>  are coming in, they're executing their construction projects, and they're not keeping the folks around involved and informed as to what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5193.575s">It</a>  doesn't matter if it's a single unit, three units, or 490. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5197.477s">When</a>  you're building and you're around people, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5202.195s">You</a>  have a responsibility to advise them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5204.878s">And</a>  so I can appreciate that there are time constraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5208.823s">Perhaps</a>  the developer didn't have as much lead time for this delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5213.108s">But</a>  I feel if we did a better job at making sure that folks coming into our city to build <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5220.697s">whatever</a>  it is, engaged with the people they would be working around and working in their neighborhoods where their homes are, things like this would not be happening and we wouldn't have folks as upset and concerned as they have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5236.852s">So</a>  I would hope that we would look at this as a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5240.956s">I</a>  think it ties <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5243.298s">to</a>  how we engage and how we communicate across the board with all of these various projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5250.105s">Not</a>  this particular neighborhood, not this particular developer, but overall there's really no mechanism that truly reaches everybody and I think that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5260.976s">Ask</a>  you guys as you discuss this further and look into it further that you think about This issue because as I said I think that if we had those vehicles in place and we had those opportunities for some of these community meetings And getting folks engaged in their neighborhoods to talk with these people We we would do better and maybe feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5285.272s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5429.413s">I'm</a>  Marian O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5433.234s">Thank</a>  you for having us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5436.822s">FEMA,</a>  the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region 1, has completed its review of Medford's hazard mitigation plan and found it approvable pending adoption by this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5451.213s">It's</a>  my understanding that upon adoption, a formal letter will be sent from FEMA, which will be in effect for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5460.82s">This</a>  formal approval will confirm Medford's eligibility to apply for mitigation grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5466.548s">administered</a>  by FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5468.609s">If</a>  not adopted, we would have to update the entire plan and submit again for FEMA review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5475.331s">And</a>  so, you know, this has been a very long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5478.952s">And</a>  I have with me Martin Pillsbury, who is with the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, who has been involved in this process for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5489.096s">It</a>  took several years for this plan to get approved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5491.737s">If</a>  I could interrupt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5493.237s">Excuse</a>  me, in the back, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5495.465s">Other</a>  people speaking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5496.305s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5506.529s">Councilor</a>  knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5507.749s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5509.01s">Mr.</a>  O'Connor, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5510.991s">Uh,</a>  also to you, um, Mr. Pillsbury, um, question that I have would be, um, whereas you're coming from the metropolitan area planning council, um, I'm sure that you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5524.078s">of</a>  vast exposure to a number of these type of plans in our surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5527.74s">So</a>  the first question that I'd ask would be, how does this plan measure up to those plans that are established in surrounding communities, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5533.803s">And</a>  number two, is there a regional focus that's taken when these plans are put together so that if a disaster does strike and there needs to be mitigation, is there a regional response or is it more of a local response?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5544.709s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5545.109s">Very</a>  good questions indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5547.11s">In</a>  fact, most of your neighboring, many of your neighboring cities and towns have recently been through the same process of developing a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5554.498s">I'm</a>  expecting this is going to be in front of the city of Malden sometime in the next few weeks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5559.561s">And</a>  in the last less than a year or so, it came up and was approved in Somerville, Cambridge, Everett, Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5566.926s">This</a>  was part of a regional group of eight cities and towns that originally came together to do an update of your plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5574.13s">And</a>  I should say that this is an update to your original hazard mitigation plan, which was adopted back in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5580.514s">That</a>  was the first of these kinds of plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5582.375s">The</a>  program was new at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5584.545s">And</a>  the way FEMA has structured this, the plans need to be renewed on a periodic basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5589.468s">So</a>  this is your first renewal of your original plan, and as was also the case for all of your neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5595.971s">Basically,</a>  FEMA is very prescriptive about what goes in these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5599.493s">There</a>  are literally codes of federal regulations that say, here's what the chapters and sections of the plan need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5605.116s">So</a>  your plans are very equivalent to your neighbor's plans, because they pretty much all have to, in order to get FEMA approval, they all have to follow sort <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5612.958s">a</a>  similar consistent format.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5616.06s">And</a>  one other question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5617.9s">Now,</a>  Mr. Pillsbury, you are a professional in the field of environmental planning, and I don't know where you live, but with this plan in place, would you feel safe and comfortable living in the city of Medford?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5627.624s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5628.204s">I</a>  think this plan will really help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5630.925s">You'll</a>  see that it outlines a number of steps you can take over the next five years to put in place improvements to your infrastructure and drainage that would mitigate the kinds of flooding that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5642.846s">And</a>  I should add that it was mentioned that when you have a plan like this approved, that makes the city eligible for FEMA grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5649.932s">And</a>  in fact, under your previous plan, the city did get a FEMA grant for work at Wright's Pond Dam, which was over a half a million dollar grant from FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5658.659s">So</a>  that's the kind of project, and there are a number of suggested projects in this plan that could be looked at in the next five years, some of which may be eligible for similar FEMA grants.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5667.046s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5667.607s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5668.648s">Based</a>  upon the discussion here, I feel comfortable <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5671.857s">voting</a>  in favor of this matter this evening.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5674.258s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5675.579s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5676.479s">Uh,</a>  you had mentioned a minute ago that, uh, it's, uh, there's a periodic, uh, renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5682.342s">So</a>  is it, is it every so many years, five years, every five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5685.444s">And</a>  does it usually take as, does it usually take as long as this took? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5689.746s">It</a>  seems like this was a bit lengthy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5690.947s">This</a>  took longer than average in a couple of your neighboring cities got into a situation here where a FEMA at the national level, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5697.786s">right</a>  in the middle of this process, changed the rules, basically, and changed the guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5703.23s">And</a>  basically, we were thinking, OK, they're not going to change horses in midstream. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5708.113s">We</a>  started the plan under the old guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5709.854s">But</a>  no, in fact, they insisted that the plan kind of be upgraded to the new. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5713.777s">And</a>  actually, it makes a better plan, because the change of guidelines that FEMA put in place was based on national experience over the first decade or so of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5723.363s">So</a>  it actually made the plan better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5725.284s">But</a>  it also required <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5726.703s">more</a>  extensive review, and the review of the draft plan has to go through two levels of review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5731.985s">It</a>  goes through MEMA, the Mass Emergency Management Agency, and then also through FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5736.346s">And</a>  in this case, because of the change in rules, it went through that process twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5739.407s">So</a>  it took longer to get through to the end of the process, but you have now got the approval letter from FEMA, and it's all over except for shouting, as they say.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5747.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5747.69s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5750.997s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5752.077s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello, and thank you for coming to explain everything to us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5757.438s">My</a>  pleasure.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5758.159s">From</a>  what I understand after reading some of the report, this was meetings that took place in Medford from around 2012, 2013 to the present, and then was put together, and as you had just spoken about, is mainly flooding is the main, obviously storms, hurricanes, things like that, we're concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5778.435s">my,</a>  my main question really would be to the, to the city with regards to making sure this, this was a hundred page document, I believe, and making sure it's like on the city website so people can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5789.004s">I</a>  think it's important to be able to get the answer questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5793.488s">We</a>  can't talk about it all tonight, the hundred pages, but are there any specific points that you think are important for the public to know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5802.796s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5804.018s">obviously</a>  live tonight, but then also we want to make sure it's on the website.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5807.26s">We</a>  will absolutely make it available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5809.321s">I</a>  have a hard copy here, but it's available as a PDF that can be put on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5812.723s">In</a>  fact, when it was a draft and we had the public meetings, that draft was put on the website and was available for public comment during the production of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5821.188s">But</a>  now that it's finalized, you want everyone to know what's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5824.77s">I</a>  guess I would say if anyone gets a chance to look at this a little bit later on, once it's up online, to look at the tables near the back of the plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5831.312s">table</a>  28 that actually lists the recommended measures, different drainage improvements and other steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5836.675s">That's</a>  really the heart of the plan saying, here's the things you can actually do that would make the city more resilient and less vulnerable to some of these hazards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5847.04s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5848.24s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5849.301s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5850.683s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5851.744s">And</a>  I, too, went through the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5854.605s">I</a>  can remember last time it was presented, we actually had a Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5859.727s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5860.207s">And</a>  we discussed this with the entire council, because it is such an in-depth report, and there's many facets to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5868.871s">My</a>  question is to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5870.112s">You</a>  just mentioned recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5872.553s">And</a>  you're right, there are recommendations that were in the last five-year plan that are still carried over into the next plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5878.916s">Some</a>  of them are, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5880.316s">Some</a>  of them are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5882.337s">I</a>  can remember the last several budgets that have come before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5887.319s">I</a>  don't recall anything the administration has brought before us, to be quite frank with you, in ways of allocations to address some of the recommendations that were made in the last report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5899.385s">Now,</a>  that may have happened, and I'm not aware of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5902.386s">but</a>  I don't remember anything in the budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5906.028s">When</a>  I looked at, I forget what section it was under, I believe it was recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5910.651s">They</a>  scaled it high, moderate and low. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5913.952s">And</a>  whether it was a high benefit to do this particular project or what the risk was, you know, and based on high, low or moderate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5924.018s">Now</a>  the areas of concern that I have that have been of concern for many years in this community are Main Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5931.382s">in</a>  Mystic Ave, in between, the whole neighborhood in between Mystic Ave and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5935.985s">And</a>  that was considered, I believe, a very high priority due to poor drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5942.128s">The</a>  same also applies to some sections of North Medford, which we refer to the Heights, which also have poor drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5950.912s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we're not just putting out a report for the sake of putting out a report and hopefully getting some funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5959.713s">We</a>  always welcome funding, especially from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5962.834s">But</a>  I just hope it's not a report that really has no teeth to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5967.296s">And</a>  I'd like to see we have over $7 million in our water and sewer enterprise account for these exact projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5974.968s">for</a>  drainage issues, for issues that I think could be addressed with some of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5982.553s">So</a>  I don't know if you can address that or not, but my concern is, you know, the flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5990.077s">I</a>  know some of the recommendations were as simple as we're notifying businesses to clean their catch basins on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5997.542s">Now</a>  that sounds like a no-brainer, but what percent of people adhere to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6003.125s">I</a>  mean, is there any follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6005.472s">I</a>  could tell you the catch basins on streets, even though they're supposedly cleaned once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6010.453s">they're</a>  in deplorable conditions throughout the community, to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6015.054s">Many</a>  of them are clogged and are in very poor condition, which leads to additional flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6020.576s">So</a>  I'm hoping that it's not just a report in name only, that these recommendations are taken seriously by this administration, and they put forth, if we don't get grants, funding in the budget to address some of these very serious drainage issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6038.361s">Because</a>  when your basement has a foot of water in it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6040.609s">That's</a>  a very major concern for a lot of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6043.772s">And</a>  when I'm at meetings in the Heights and a woman's telling me up around Tamar Drive that her water pump runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6054.744s">Those</a>  are concerning issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6057.087s">So</a>  I don't know if you can address that in particular.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6060.153s">Vice</a>  President Marks, let me say that that's music to my ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6062.975s">As</a>  a planner, the thing we worry about most is trying our best to make a good plan and then having it proverbially gather dust on a shelf because no one implements it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6071.542s">So</a>  you're right on target to what, now you have a good plan here, it's been looked at by a lot of eyes and through FEMA and MEMA, and now it's really on the city to, over the next five years, implement parts of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6082.111s">Now</a>  on the positive side, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6083.556s">This</a>  plan did go back and look at the recommendations made in your last plan and said, what happened to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6088.239s">And</a>  there's a table right in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6090.261s">Some</a>  of them were completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6092.002s">And</a>  those that weren't completed, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough funding or whatever the reason may be, we re-looked at them and say, are these still relevant recommendations? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6099.908s">They</a>  haven't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6100.588s">Should</a>  they be carried in? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6101.969s">And</a>  they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6103.27s">We</a>  also added some new recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6105.071s">But</a>  over the course of the next five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6107.603s">The</a>  idea is that you don't just sort of set this aside and wait for five years to come and renew the plan for the sake of just having a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6114.507s">There's</a>  actually a process in the back spelled out by which the city would continue to occasionally convene this group that helped to put the plan together, because it's a very interdisciplinary effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6123.532s">It</a>  has lots of different departments and commissions and boards involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6127.294s">And</a>  it's a vision that you would, over time, take from these recommendations and move some of them ahead as you can, whether it's through a FEMA grant <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6134.798s">or</a>  through your own city funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6136.239s">And</a>  the table in here actually spells out where some of these might have to just be city funding because they're important, but they may not all be eligible for FEMA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6145.222s">And</a>  even those that are eligible for FEMA funding, FEMA requires a 25% local match for all of their grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6151.384s">They'll</a>  pay you 75% of the cost, but you still have to be prepared to put up something as well for those grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6157.767s">So</a>  it's very important what you say about keeping the implementation of this and making sure that it's not just a plan that gathers dust.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6164.812s">So</a>  just if I can ask you my last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6167.194s">So</a>  FEMA requires the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6169.515s">It</a>  requires cities and towns to present.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6172.057s">If</a>  I could answer that, they actually don't require. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6174.158s">This</a>  is not a mandate like an unfunded mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6177.181s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6177.501s">What</a>  they do is they put the incentive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6179.682s">If</a>  you want any FEMA grants under this program, you have to have an approved plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6183.565s">So</a>  it's an incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6185.466s">If</a>  you didn't ever care about getting a FEMA grant, you wouldn't have to do one of these plans and there would be no penalty other than that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6192.75s">So</a>  there's no associated timeline that FEMA puts out saying, you know what, okay, these are your recommendations, Matthew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6199.836s">We</a>  appreciate you putting together this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6201.798s">You're</a>  eligible for grant funding now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6203.779s">However,</a>  we would like to see a percentage of these particular recommendations implemented by X date, or at least reviewed by.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6212.086s">You're</a>  asking some very good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6213.527s">The</a>  table of recommendations actually puts some target dates on when over the five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6218.712s">Would</a>  this one be in the first year or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6220.673s">would</a>  this one be in year three or this one be in year five? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6223.576s">You</a>  actually have that in there based on the city's team's best estimate of when some of these would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6229.16s">But</a>  I will say that in the interim five years, FEMA does not come back and look over your shoulder and say, now are you making progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6235.966s">When</a>  you come and do your next five-year update, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6238.93s">That's</a>  when you'll have to kind of, the day of reckoning will come to say, what did you do with this over the last five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6243.591s">And</a>  did you, what did you implement and what didn't you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6245.951s">So</a>  that's the time when it will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6248.112s">You</a>  don't want to wait until the last minute and be caught up short.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6251.052s">Have</a>  you ever seen FEMA deny a report?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6254.433s">Oh,</a>  well, the plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6256.213s">Have</a>  you ever seen FEMA deny one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6258.193s">They</a>  have, they don't use the term deny. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6261.054s">What</a>  they have done is returned draft plans with revisions required. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6267.23s">And</a>  that's actually part of what happened here because of the change in regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6270.331s">The</a>  plan that was originally submitted met the old regulations, but didn't meet the new ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6274.993s">And</a>  so they will often return these plans basically with revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6278.274s">It's</a>  like turning in a paper to your professor and getting it marked up and say, go back and fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6282.756s">And</a>  so that, but that's in the interest of making a better plan, not to be punitive to the community, to making a better, more complete plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6289.619s">And</a>  just, Mr. President, my other question is to the board of health director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6293.788s">Now</a>  that you are acting, I guess, full-time or part-time as the emergency preparedness person in the community, where we used to have someone that did it as their job, although it may not have been a full-time job, that was what they were dedicated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6310.061s">How</a>  are you finding that now in your role, a very busy office at Border Health, a number of employees underneath you, a lot of issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6317.647s">Are</a>  you finding yourself being able to spend ample time as the emergency preparedness person for this community?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6323.836s">I</a>  think you could spend a lot more time doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6326.197s">It</a>  certainly could be a full-time job, but as part of public health, we do emergency preparedness planning all the time, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6333.0s">So</a>  it's been able to be part of my job, as well as working with MIMR. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6338.123s">I'm</a>  part of the emergency management director group with MIMR. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6342.264s">So</a>  I've been keeping up with them and trying to get a local committee together, because it's not just a one-man job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6347.587s">Emergency</a>  preparedness is really a huge job that requires multidisciplinary teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6353.08s">That's</a>  what we're trying to develop, but I will be working to get a team together again to look at this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6358.585s">I</a>  already talked with the energy and environmental folks and we're going to be getting a local committee back together again to really revisit this plan and see what we can get done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6366.812s">So</a>  currently right now we don't have a local, uh, committee for emergency preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6371.637s">It's</a>  just yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6373.158s">Well,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6374.059s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6374.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6375.0s">And</a>  in the past there was a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6376.981s">I'm</a>  not aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6377.782s">Is</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6377.922s">I,</a> </p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6379.87s">I</a>  believe that they should have been if there wasn't, but yeah, usually it's your public safety folks, you know, um, public health building, uh, mostly community development, people who would be involved in the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6392.756s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6394.017s">I</a>  just want to thank you both for your time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6395.697s">This</a>  was a very lengthy and thorough, uh, report put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6399.019s">Um,</a>  and, uh, I think it does benefit the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6403.121s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6403.461s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6404.201s">Madam</a>  director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6404.842s">If</a>  I could ask a question as, as a reviewing the report, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6410.073s">Mr.</a>  Mangoni is still listed as the person on the, if we could take his name off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6414.555s">So</a>  if somebody wants to contact somebody and replace it with the proper person would be, would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6419.497s">We'll</a>  have to update that whole committee.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6421.057s">If</a>  you can do that before you publish it to the webpage would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6425.639s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6426.74s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6427.46s">I</a>  have a couple of quick additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6429.841s">Um,</a>  so you had mentioned about, uh, this being a full time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6434.383s">There's</a>  enough work to make it a full time position.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6437.832s">You</a>  could spend, emergency preparedness, you could really spend a lot of time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6443.396s">In</a>  your experience throughout the years, do you see other cities and towns that actually have a full-time person? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6449.26s">I'm</a>  just curious.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6449.94s">There</a>  are a few that have full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6451.981s">A</a>  lot of them have part-time, but certainly there are communities with full-time emergency management directors.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6458.706s">Do</a>  they more or less communities that maybe live closer to the coast or that are closer to the coast, I guess, or is it just in general?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6465.704s">It</a>  varies, not based on location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6468.366s">It's</a>  usually size.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6469.968s">Size,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6470.588s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6471.789s">And</a>  as far as you had mentioned about putting a committee together, that committee's not together yet?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6478.995s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6479.496s">We're</a>  working on it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6480.217s">Do</a>  you know when that will be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6481.658s">When</a>  the goal is to actually have the committee get together and meet?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6484.48s">I'd</a>  like to try to get a meeting together in June and then start quarterly meetings.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6488.283s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6489.344s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6489.745s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6551.007s">These</a>  have been for natural disasters.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6552.963s">Oh,</a>  specifically just for natural disasters? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6555.365s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6556.666s">Well,</a>  then I guess that answers all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6559.087s">I</a>  don't have to address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6560.248s">But</a>  one last question to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6561.889s">I</a>  know Councilor Breanna Lungo-Koehn has brought up often hiring a full-time grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6568.093s">Has</a>  the city of Medford done that yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6569.854s">Not</a>  to my knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6570.815s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6571.275s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6572.076s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6754.961s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6756.882s">I</a>  put this on last week after a few concerned residents had filled me in on what was going on down at Macklin Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6766.309s">It</a>  looks like there's a potential subdivision that was <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6770.658s">put</a>  forth before the Office of Community Development site plan review last Wednesday, and is before, I believe, the Conservation Commission within the next couple days tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6784.701s">Tomorrow,</a>  in front of the Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6789.342s">Right,</a>  6.30 tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6791.382s">So</a>  my concern, obviously, we've been involved in a number of different developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6797.644s">We've</a>  had a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6799.627s">A</a>  bunch of us have tried to go to a number of meetings, whether it be ZBA or OCD, Office of Community Development, private meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6808.191s">This</a>  one, I wasn't able to attend last Wednesday, but I do know that the residents have extreme concerns with regards to this being near, close to a conservation buffer, as well as potential flooding in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6821.817s">I</a>  know this abuts McCormick Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6824.577s">And</a>  there are residents on McCormick Ave that are very concerned that they're going to experience additional flooding on their road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6833.08s">So</a>  if we could just get an update from the Conservation Commission with any potential concerns they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6841.403s">I</a>  know they're going to meet tomorrow night, but hopefully not only get an update from them, but let them know that the Metro City Council, if we could amend the paper, is very concerned, is interested in the residents concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6853.484s">concerns</a>  with regards to the flooding and the conservation buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6858.427s">So</a>  if we could let them know we are concerned and get an update with regards to what needs to be done if this is a project that can go forward, cannot go forward, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6871.455s">I</a>  believe it's three homes that are going to create a potential cul-de-sac in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6877.14s">And</a>  I do have, I mean, I live up in the Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6878.96s">I</a>  am concerned for my neighbors with regards to any, nobody wants any flooding in their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6884.922s">And</a>  if this is going to create that, we want to make sure we either do it in the right way or prevent it from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6890.724s">So</a>  if we could get some answers, that would be beneficial to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6895.625s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6897.205s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6897.705s">Counsel</a>  Lungo-Koehn Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6902.193s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6903.534s">I</a>  had the opportunity to attend the meeting last Wednesday before the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6909.058s">And</a>  on Macklin Road, there were a number of residents, as Council Member Curran mentioned, the proposal is to build three new homes on an area that abuts wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6920.585s">And</a>  I guess the Conservation Commission tomorrow night will be addressing whether or not the particular wetlands up there are active wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6932.13s">And</a>  that determination, I guess, will have a big impact whether or not this project moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6938.132s">But</a>  the neighborhood, Mr. President, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, the project itself is in an area that is nestled between protected wetlands and homes towards the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6952.857s">The</a>  proposed homes are elevated higher than the homes behind them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6957.099s">So</a>  the residents were concerned that there would be <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6960.539s">a</a>  fair amount of runoff water into the yard in an area that I mentioned earlier when we were talking about the hazard mitigation plan, that there are residents up there that have sump pumps that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6976.227s">They</a>  never shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6977.708s">That's</a>  how much groundwater is in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6981.07s">And</a>  it's the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6982.991s">There's</a>  poor drainage, Mr. President, but there's also the Cranberry Brook up there, which is an open brook that's been up there for many, many years, and I guess takes runoff water from a lot of the surrounding area and possibly even some of the local rivers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7003.205s">A</a>  second concern was regarding water pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7007.327s">And</a>  I've been on this council a number of years, and I can tell you firsthand that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7011.614s">When</a>  you hear water pressure, it's synonymous with North Medford and the Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7016.86s">Poor</a>  water pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7017.861s">If</a>  someone next door is washing their car, the gentleman can't take a shower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7022.547s">That's</a>  how poor the pressure is, Mr. President, in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7026.83s">Residents,</a>  although it's only three homes, have the right to request and say, what's going to happen with our water pressure? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7033.556s">It's</a>  already low as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7035.618s">What</a>  is going to be the case with new development in the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7039.841s">Some</a>  several years back, we put a new pump to improve pressure at the bottom of Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7045.386s">And</a>  that has done some help in providing additional water pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7050.392s">But</a>  towards the top of the heights, I don't think it's alleviated any concerns that residents have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7056.839s">Also,</a>  based on the plane of these homes, they're going to have to have a pump that pumps their sewage from the house to the city of Medford sewer line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7066.609s">Because</a>  of the angle, it doesn't flow as it should flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7072.819s">They're</a>  going to create these storage containers under the ground, giant sewage storage containers for these three homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7082.291s">They're</a>  made out of cement and they work like, you know, if sewage is going into them, there's a pump that sends it back out to <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7091.604s">the</a>  sewage pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7092.626s">However,</a>  because of power outages, they're equipped only to handle up to 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7099.296s">So</a>  if you happen to have a power outage, Mr. President, that's over 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7103.495s">And</a>  that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7104.416s">I</a>  mean, it happens quite frequently in areas of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7108.078s">These</a>  sewage container systems aren't equipped to accommodate the sewage that's going to be going into them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7113.681s">And</a>  that poses another concern that residents had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7116.603s">Well,</a>  how will it back up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7117.503s">Will</a>  it back up into the new homes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7118.984s">Or</a>  will it end up going up the pipe and possibly backing into our homes? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7123.827s">And</a>  that was another question that was asked regarding the sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7129.391s">The</a>  snow removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7130.751s">This</a>  is a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7132.438s">Who's</a>  responsible ultimately for the snow removal? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7135.26s">And</a>  where is the snow going to be put? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7137.142s">Is</a>  it going to be put back on the city street? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7139.183s">Is</a>  it going to be put towards wetlands? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7140.784s">And</a>  as we all know, you can't put snow because of salt and other debris near any type of wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7147.529s">That's</a>  a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7149.551s">And</a>  the ownership of the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7152.033s">Where</a>  this is a private road, I believe the developer is responsible for the ownership of the water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7158.017s">But</a>  those pipes are going to lead 100, 150 feet, 200 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7163.983s">And</a>  if one breaks during the night, who's responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7167.506s">It's</a>  not the city's water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7169.488s">It's</a>  leading to the city's water pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7171.93s">So</a>  there are a number of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7176.314s">And</a>  just so you know, these are three lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7178.816s">There's</a>  also another, from what I understand, 14 other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7182.603s">non-buildable</a>  lots as it stands right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7185.084s">Some</a>  are undersized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7187.445s">And</a>  that will be the next step, I can almost guarantee you, if these homes go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7193.048s">The</a>  second point I wanted to bring up was 252 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7196.489s">It's</a>  currently a multi-family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7198.03s">I</a>  believe it's a two or three family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7201.671s">It's</a>  right on Main Street, not right around the corner from, which street is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7210.357s">Hancock</a>  Street, correct, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7213.539s">And</a>  they're taking a two or three family home, and they're trying to create nine units, like they did a couple doors down in that blue monstrosity that I referred to it as, that doesn't fit into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7227.785s">It</a>  just so happens they're gonna be looking for a variance, because they're three spots shy of the variance for parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7236.069s">And</a>  as we know, that's already a congested area, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7238.521s">It's</a>  already on Main Street where you can't park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7241.223s">And</a>  what will be happening, even though they're saying, it's all you hear now at these meetings, the millennials are moving in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7248.067s">It's</a>  like Paul Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7249.088s">The</a>  millennials are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7250.028s">The</a>  millennials are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7251.409s">And,</a>  oh, they won't have cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7252.87s">They'll</a>  never have families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7253.771s">They'll</a>  never have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7255.312s">I</a>  don't know how you can state that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7258.134s">It</a>  sounds good when you make a presentation, I guess, to get what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7261.976s">But</a>  it's not reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7264.017s">And</a>  in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7265.314s">If</a>  you don't conform to current ordinances right now, in particular parking and height restrictions, which seem to be the major catching point, I don't think your project should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7275.34s">And</a>  that's the way I feel about 252 High Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7279.763s">And</a>  so I'm looking forward to see what happens with both of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7285.306s">And</a>  I hope that the neighborhood on both Macklin <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7290.07s">and</a>  252 Main Street and South Method are looped into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7293.853s">So</a>  there's plenty of neighborhood input and feedback, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7297.897s">And</a>  what day is this meeting, Mr. Vice President?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7299.818s">I</a>  believe it's tomorrow, the Conservation Commission meeting at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7303.261s">I</a>  believe tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7305.363s">And</a>  they're going to talk about at least Macklin on the wetlands up there, whether they're active or slightly active. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7313.129s">I</a>  don't know the exact terminology, but that's what they're going to decide, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7317.393s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7319.225s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7320.266s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7321.086s">I</a>  want to thank my council colleagues for bringing these resolutions forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7324.668s">Uh,</a>  I've been called a number of times with regard to the, uh, Macklin road, uh, development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7329.671s">And,</a>  um, I had the opportunity to, uh, to attend the, uh, the conservation commission meeting along with you actually on April 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7337.676s">And,</a>  uh, it was at the, uh, community development board meeting last week with council of marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7341.938s">I</a>  had to leave a little bit early. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7342.979s">My</a>  son had a band concert, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7346.163s">the</a>  residents in this neighborhood, uh, up in the Macklin road area have really rallied behind this to, uh, see what they can do, um, to, to, you know, hopefully prevent or at least make this small than it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7358.09s">I</a>  mean, my colleagues mentioned tonight, there are a lot of concerns with regard to, uh, what putting in three new homes you're going to bring to this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7366.855s">Uh,</a>  you go down McCormick, have you drive down McCormick have tonight, you will see hoses coming out of the basements of these homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7372.826s">And</a>  they are constantly pumping water out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7375.507s">The</a>  sub pumps are going nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7377.707s">And</a>  no one should have to live like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7379.628s">And</a>  I think by putting in three new homes, it's completely going to exasperate the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7385.369s">So</a>  I think that we really have to take the city or the Conservation Commission and the Community Development Board really have to take this under consideration when looking at a development like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7396.412s">So</a>  major flooding is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7402.655s">You</a>  know, I think disrupting the ground in that area, I mean, you know, you're near a brook. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7406.817s">I</a>  mean, that's completely unknown what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7408.859s">The</a>  water has to flow somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7410.96s">So</a>  this is a concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7413.181s">You</a>  know, Council Marks mentioned that water pressure in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7416.103s">A</a>  lot of friends that live up there in, you know, water pressure is tough, tough on that street in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7422.006s">You</a>  know, someone called me and said, you know, I can't, you know, take a shower and have someone flush the toilet at the same time or else the water, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7428.83s">completely</a>  shuts down almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7430.151s">So,</a>  I mean, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7431.671s">You</a>  go to environmental issues, you take a look, this developer has already cut down one tree within the buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7439.875s">And</a>  that's completely blatant disrespect to our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7444.317s">I</a>  mean, that's completely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7445.998s">And</a>  so, you know, I mean, I think, you know, when they're cutting down trees in a buffer zone, you know, right away that should send up red flags, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7455.946s">Like</a>  my colleagues mentioned, they're proposing three homes on this cul-de-sac. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7460.871s">And</a>  one of the homes is within the wetlands buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7465.014s">And</a>  I think we have to be really careful here as a city, because if you're going to allow something like this, you're setting precedent for future development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7471.74s">You're</a>  setting precedent for other homes in other wetland-type areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7476.344s">We</a>  need to watch out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7478.225s">It's</a>  completely wrong, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7480.948s">Kudos</a>  to the citizens, really, for stepping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7484.07s">But</a>  I think there was probably 60 to 70, 75 people at the Conservation Commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7490.474s">There</a>  were a lot of residents here last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7492.255s">And</a>  I give them a lot of credit, because both of those meetings have been continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7496.797s">So</a>  it's meeting after meeting, week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7499.378s">So</a>  I really applaud your tenacity of going after this and staying on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7505.081s">And</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7507.443s">But</a>  really, there's a lot of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7512.632s">You're</a>  trying to think out of the box here a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7515.294s">You</a>  mentioned Council Marks, how there's 14 other lots that are unbuildable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7520.377s">And</a>  everyone's trying to come here and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7524.08s">But</a>  I mean, we take a look at the CPA and how we passed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7528.67s">The</a>  community passed that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7531.853s">I</a>  know the CPA here is in its infancy, but this is something that really, you talk about open space and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7539.159s">This</a>  is something that probably could be considered, that the city could maybe purchase at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7544.783s">And</a>  I'm not saying one of the first projects, but maybe down the line they could purchase this in a place of conservation restriction on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7552.229s">So</a>  you can't build on it in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7554.428s">And</a>  I think that's, you know, these are things that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7557.45s">But,</a>  you know, I did promise a resident tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7561.833s">It's</a>  really been on top of the situation since, you know, there's a resident up on McCormick Ave, Will Humphreys, nice guy, and he's been on top of this since this came about, this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7573.942s">And</a>  he said, you know, he couldn't make it to the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7576.504s">And</a>  like I said, I mean, these residents have been going to meetings nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7580.962s">And</a>  he said, can you please read a letter for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7582.403s">And</a>  I said, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7583.424s">I</a>  mean, if he's going to be here tomorrow night, then he's going to be at a meeting next week, whenever the Conservation Commission meets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7590.889s">I</a>  said, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7591.729s">I'll</a>  read the letter for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7593.49s">And</a>  I'll submit this into the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7595.011s">I'll</a>  make a copy for you, Mr. Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7598.454s">To</a>  whom it may concern, I'm ready to ask Method elected representatives, commissions, and boards to listen to its citizens when considering this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7607.18s">Thank</a>  you to the Environment Department and Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7611.03s">in</a>  the Community Development Office and Board, the City Engineer, the City Council, and the ongoing attention to the many problems with this subdivision proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7619.314s">The</a>  community that surrounds this development is speaking out with a unified voice of concern and opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7627.897s">Many</a>  citizens attended meetings on the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7631.219s">Concerns</a>  expressed include loss of storm and flood water retention capacity, increased <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7638.658s">throughput</a>  to sewer and water systems that are already strained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7642.321s">Damage</a>  to existing homes and extensive blasting of ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7645.844s">Loss</a>  of aesthetically pleasing natural green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7650.588s">Wildlife</a>  habitat destruction and damage to wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7654.451s">Increased</a>  traffic near Carr Park and the Tot Lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7657.503s">Access</a>  Issues and Disturbance to Direct the Butter on Macklin Road were a non-profit organization that provides services to several long-time residents with developmental disabilities at the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7671.247s">He</a>  also goes on to say that he included a petition of 115 Medford residents, representing much of the surrounding neighborhood, echoing these same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7682.482s">in</a>  its current state is of great value to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7685.663s">This</a>  is the opposite of an abandoned building in need of improvement or environmental cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7691.645s">The</a>  surrounding neighborhood is unified in opposition to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7695.086s">No</a>  public benefit is served through development of the subdivision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7699.147s">Medford's</a>  assessors has long considered 13 of the 14 lots as undevelopable when assessing their value. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7707.452s">Therefore,</a>  the city should not grant any waivers or variances to existing regulations around roadways, setbacks, zoning, and building codes, or environmental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7717.28s">Those</a>  regulations exist to protect our city, its citizens, and its ecosystems. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7722.604s">If</a>  the regulations can't be adhered to, then the land should not be developed upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7726.507s">Sincerely,</a>  Will Humphreys. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7728.409s">So</a>  I just wanted to read that on his behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7730.19s">Like</a>  I said, I will print out a copy of that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7732.812s">But</a>  I think, you know, one of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7735.585s">things</a>  just to conclude on is that, you know, this is a unique piece of land in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7742.047s">Um,</a>  you know, it's, it's one of the few remaining areas within the city of Medford that has, you know, woodland habitat and you know, we really need to preserve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7750.11s">So</a>  I just wanted to go on the record and saying that I thank my colleagues for bringing this up for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7754.372s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7754.712s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7755.012s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7757.913s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7759.354s">I'm</a>  an culture era and my address is 17 McCormick Gav. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7763.527s">And</a>  I'm here to speak against the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7766.349s">I</a>  directly abut the property being developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7769.851s">And</a>  I've lived there for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7772.232s">My</a>  husband has lived there and his family on that street since the 1950s. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7778.116s">And</a>  we, as has been stated, have had lots of problems with water pressure, with flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7789.003s">And</a>  we are concerned that this is going to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7793.202s">to</a>  those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7795.904s">So</a>  that's a big concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7797.545s">We</a>  also feel that it's detrimental to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7801.188s">A</a>  lot of people have moved into the neighborhood because we have some green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7806.392s">There</a>  isn't much in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7809.255s">And</a>  we're also concerned about added traffic to the area because it's a very tight, where Winslow goes into Tamor, you know, it cuts off and there's a lot of kids coming that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7822.689s">on</a>  bicycles going to car park and so forth, and the group home on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7828.773s">So</a>  we feel that this is a dead end road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7834.998s">And</a>  people on Tamor have also expressed that the wetland, they're concerned that it's going to exasperate the problems they have with wetlands behind them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7845.885s">So</a>  the concern that one wetland sort of feeds into another, and as has been said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7852.659s">the</a>  water has to go somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7854.501s">Uh,</a>  so we're, we're glad that you're, uh, reviewing this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7860.185s">Um,</a>  the neighborhood has been very united, uh, against this development and we hope that it does not go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7869.553s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7870.513s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7870.794s">Mr.</a>  Coltrane. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7874.617s">Any</a>  address to the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7876.258s">My</a>  name is Jen Young and I live at 72 McCormick Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7880.521s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7882.411s">My</a>  husband and I actually bought our home from the Coltreras 13 years ago, and we live just down the street from them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7890.913s">And</a>  one of the reasons that we chose to move to Medford and to this area of Medford was because of that green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7897.675s">We</a>  decided when we saw the house on a dead-end street, and we could imagine our kids riding their bikes down the street, which they do now, and then that we can see trees and we can see green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7909.137s">And</a>  I think one of the things that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7912.346s">surprised</a>  us when we moved in was in the late winter seeing this sort of path going through our backyard across the street into this area that we're talking about, which has become a real kind of wildlife sort of pathway coming from the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7928.494s">And</a>  I think kind of building in that area or even next to that area really limits the wildlife area in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7936.878s">And</a>  I think it's really important to keep the green space that we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7941.721s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7942.56s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7945.562s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Vice President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7953.047s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7953.848s">Through</a>  the Chair, thank you, President Caraviello, because I couldn't make the Wednesday night meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7958.971s">Do</a>  you know what the final, does anybody know what the final vote was for the site plan review?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7966.656s">Councilor</a>  Falco, if you can.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7968.218s">From</a>  what I've been told, they've been more questions than answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7973.081s">I</a>  guess the developer has not been really able to answer much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7975.763s">No</a>  vote was taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7976.984s">So</a>  no vote was taken.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7977.785s">So</a>  no vote's been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7979.286s">They</a>  have to go in front of the Conservation Commission again tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7982.268s">And</a>  then they're going again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7983.348s">They're</a>  going in front of the Community Development Board again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7987.231s">I</a>  don't know the date of that meeting, but there were a ton of questions from both commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7993.815s">And</a>  the developer needs to get back to both boards <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7998.475s">with</a>  the answers to those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7999.856s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8006.459s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8007.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8008.139s">Um,</a>  and with regards to tomorrow night's meeting, I mean, it sounds like there update notice of intent regarding the creation of the subdivision on Macklin road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8019.203s">with</a>  one proposed lot, so does anybody know exactly what tomorrow night will be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8023.185s">Will</a>  it be question and answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8025.266s">Will</a>  the public be able to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8027.127s">I</a>  just don't know if my colleagues know the answer to that either.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8030.529s">I</a>  would assume everyone will be able to speak tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8032.87s">They</a>  didn't say that there would be any restrictions.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8040.33s">I'm</a>  under the same impression that everyone's going to be able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8043.071s">And</a>  hopefully, the developer will have answers to the questions that the commission had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8049.772s">Because</a>  they had, I think, a laundry list of questions that needed to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8053.253s">And</a>  I believe that the Conservation Commission was actually going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8056.514s">They</a>  had done one site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8058.574s">And</a>  I think they were going to do, or at least there was one member that actually wanted to go out and look at the wetlands, I think, to actually physically see the space.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8070.455s">That's</a>  good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8070.856s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8071.416s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8072.197s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8078.585s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8079.747s">I</a>  believe also last Wednesday there were many issues, as Councilor Falco mentioned, that were not answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8087.955s">Although</a>  the city engineer was in attendance and many of them were directed to her, the committee requested that, the community development board requested that the city engineer sit down with the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8100.961s">So</a>  I think in between these other meetings that have taken place with the conservation committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8105.995s">commission</a>  that the city engineer is going to meet to discuss ownership of pipes and other issues that deal with engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8113.519s">So</a>  I think that's the first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8115.42s">The</a>  second point, Mr. President, is we heard tonight, and that's why I mentioned to the board that came before us for emergency preparedness, is that, you know, year after year, the city recommends that we attend to certain areas that are prone to flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8134.208s">And</a>  the Heights is listed all the time, Salt Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8136.831s">There's</a>  a number of hotspots that this community is aware of for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8141.295s">And</a>  there are steps that we can take for a very minimal amount of money to help alleviate some of the concerns that we're hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8150.544s">Back</a>  several years ago, I met with residents on McCormick Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8154.227s">that</a>  were concerned that just a simple issue of how the street is sloped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8158.731s">You</a>  know, people were building up their driveway because the street was sloped so the water wouldn't pour into catch basins, but pour into people's driveways, which eventually ends up in their basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8169.8s">And</a>  these were simple things that, you know, grinding of a street and repositioning and re-angling a street <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8176.555s">So</a>  it pours into a catch basin and not into people's driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8180.457s">But</a>  there were people's driveways that were up literally five to six inches above the street because they were so sick of having water pour into their driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8190.023s">But</a>  these are the type of fixes, Mr. President, that with $7.5 million of money <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8196.002s">that's</a>  out there with the water and sewer enterprise account that we should be looking at, Mr. President, and, you know, not relying on residents to pump out their basement 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8209.013s">So</a>  I would also ask, Mr. President, that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8213.576s">look</a>  into McCormick Ave regarding the slope and the pitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8217.578s">This</a>  was back several years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8218.979s">I'm</a>  sure the city didn't go out there and grind the whole street and probably angle the street, but I would ask that that be taken care of now by the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8230.884s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8232.225s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8234.436s">So</a>  what is it we're voting on, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8236.196s">We're</a>  going to be asking the Office of Energy and the Environment to, and the Conservation Commission, to report back to us with any potential concerns regarding the Macklin Road development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8245.158s">And</a>  we're asking for an engineering study on McCormick Avenue relative to slope and pitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8248.598s">Is</a>  that what we're voting on?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8249.439s">That</a>  is correct, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8250.359s">Move</a>  approval of the question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8253.819s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8257.0s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8257.64s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8258.58s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8261.321s">17446,</a>  offered by Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8264.413s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council receive an updated list of tree stumps and sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8271.759s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8273.641s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8274.982s">I</a>  hate to put this on the agenda again, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8278.144s">I'm</a>  going to put it on the agenda again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8280.226s">It</a>  was several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8281.707s">I</a>  offered a resolution asking for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8283.529s">I</a>  think it was amended by several councilors to get an update of a sidewalk and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8290.648s">street</a>  repair and stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8293.189s">And</a>  to date, I don't recall receiving anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8295.75s">I</a>  don't know if my fellow colleagues, sometimes it may skip a packet, but I didn't receive anything, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8302.374s">And</a>  I could just tell you firsthand that the calls I'm receiving regarding stump removal, I must be the king of stump removal because I keep on receiving call after call from people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8314.419s">And</a>  they tell me when they call City Hall, they're being told they're on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8319.498s">And</a>  I hate to laugh at people, but that list, I tell them, could be three, four, five, 10 years before your stump gets taken out, assuming you are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8328.822s">So</a>  once again, Mr. President, that I would ask, and I think Councilor Knights, the Chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee, I would ask that, like I did several weeks back regarding street sweeping, I think we have to put together, because there is no clear, in my opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8345.77s">There</a>  is no clear approach in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8349.093s">I'm</a>  not aware of any rules or regulations administratively that require stumps to be removed within a certain time frame after the tree is taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8361.222s">So</a>  once you have a public hearing to remove a tree, once the tree wardens out there determines <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8366.072s">The</a>  tree's unsafe or it's unhealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8367.993s">It</a>  needs to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8369.134s">There's</a>  a lengthy process that's governed by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8372.396s">Then</a>  what happens on our end, Mr. President, there is no process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8376.779s">So</a>  the tree will come down eventually, and the stump will remain for one, two, three, four, five years in front of someone's home that is paying taxes that have been increased the last 25 years, year after year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8390.587s">So</a>  I would ask that the Public Works Subcommittee, I don't think they met on the other issue, I know Councilor Knight has his hands full with a lot of requests, that a city ordinance be created. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8400.338s">This</a>  would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8401.92s">The</a>  subcommittee could do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8403.682s">But</a>  within 30 days, Mr. President, of a tree removal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8407.697s">that</a>  the stump should be taken down to the ground, Mr. President, and also the sidewalk repaired or a new tree planted, depending on the wish of the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8418.124s">But</a>  there has to be a time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8420.105s">We</a>  can't continue to operate this way, Mr. President, where residents are not sure they're on the list, they may be on the list, and looking at a stump, an unsightly stump in front of their home for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8433.053s">Regarding</a>  the sidewalks, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8436.095s">The</a>  mayor is looking at right now a beautification process where $250,000 the mayor is putting out for each of the five business districts, so they would get $50,000 each, and looking to put out a survey in the community for business owners and residents to ask for beautification within the different business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8456.105s">And</a>  the business owners that I've spoken to, John Pompeo and Wes Method and other business owners throughout the community, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8465.209s">They're</a>  more concerned about the basic issues of cracked sidewalks, Mr. President, the lack of signage within different business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8475.071s">That's</a>  what they're concerned about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8477.632s">And,</a>  you know, it's great to have this $50,000, and it's great to put it out there and get input from everyone, but they just want the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8486.214s">And</a>  that's what they're explaining to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8489.035s">I</a>  just want to put in a plug, Mr. President, that I don't think we have to wait for a $250,000 offering from the mayor to have a survey go out to do the basic amenities to fix a sidewalk in front of a business owner's establishment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8504.644s">I</a>  don't think we have to jump through six to eight months worth of hurdles to do basic, basic city improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8511.062s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8513.444s">This</a>  be sent to the subcommittee on public works, and that an ordinance be created to put a timeframe on when a stump will be removed after tree removal, so residents don't have to wonder what's gonna happen, Mr. President, any longer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8528.896s">The</a>  public works subcommittee is Councilor Knight, Vice President Marks, and Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8535.721s">And</a>  that $250,000 has been sitting there for a couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8540.542s">waiting</a>  for something to happen with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8543.145s">So</a>  that's not new money or found money that's been sitting there from the, I think, McGlynn's administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8549.453s">No,</a>  no, Mr. President, no, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8552.537s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, that was money that Mayor McGlynn put aside.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8558.45s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8559.611s">So</a>  the beautification or whatever they want to call it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8562.653s">He</a>  put aside $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8564.134s">The</a>  mayor has changed it around now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8565.695s">We</a>  have a new mayor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8566.455s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8566.976s">This</a>  mayor is going to request that the council vote $250,000 out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8571.439s">Additional.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8572.179s">Not</a>  additional. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8574.321s">Not</a>  additional. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8575.061s">It's</a>  $50,000 for each business district divided by $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8577.723s">That's</a>  five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8579.804s">So</a>  the mayor has changed it around and that's her authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8584.074s">Um,</a>  so she didn't follow through with the payment list.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8586.395s">We</a>  were using that money that was in that fund for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8591.836s">Not</a>  that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8593.076s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8594.576s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8595.476s">I</a>  just wanted to thank Councilor Marksley for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8598.517s">Uh,</a>  this is a definite concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8600.177s">Um,</a>  you go through, uh, each neighbor, this dumps all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8604.358s">So</a>  I would definitely be in favor of a ordinance to, uh, to police this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8608.639s">Um,</a>  I think that it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8611.14s">Um,</a>  you know, it's sad that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8613.054s">When</a>  you have stumps out there year after year, they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8617.555s">And</a>  they should be addressed right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8619.976s">To</a>  me, it's a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8621.397s">You</a>  have kids walking down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8622.637s">We're</a>  encouraging people to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8625.098s">We</a>  have a complete streets program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8627.158s">And</a>  you're encouraging people to get out there and walk, but you're forcing people into the street when there's stumps all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8635.161s">And</a>  I think it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8636.801s">I</a>  got a call from a resident the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8638.342s">He</a>  has a tree on his sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8640.983s">It's</a>  popping up the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8642.737s">the</a>  curbs falling away from the, from the side is separating from the sidewalk and that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8648.742s">And</a>  you know, so we have issues like this all over our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8651.625s">It</a>  doesn't matter what neighborhood you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8653.046s">Um,</a>  they're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8654.527s">And,</a>  uh, so I'd be in full support of, uh, in ordinance to police this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8658.29s">I</a>  think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8659.191s">And</a>  if you wouldn't mind me, uh, amending your resolution, if we could have, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8665.682s">49</a>  Bradshaw Street added to the list of sidewalk repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8670.084s">Just</a>  if the DPW could go out there and take a look.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8672.165s">Okay,</a>  we'll put on the next one then.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8686.528s">Vice</a>  President Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8687.53s">Just</a>  if I could, Mr. President, this council over the years has asked National Grid regarding double polls, their polls in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8696.763s">And</a>  we've required the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8698.926s">We've</a>  asked them on countless times to create a state law <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8703.302s">that</a>  would put a time frame on when National Grid can sit on these double poles, how long they can sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8709.004s">And</a>  it was back, I think, two or three years ago, the state legislature finally put together a law, a state law, that requires National Grid to address their double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8719.068s">Here</a>  we are on the city side, Mr. President, where you may not have a double pole, but you may have a stump in front of your house for five years, and there's no requirement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8727.372s">So</a>  there is no administrative policy that I'm aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8730.713s">And</a>  the fact that the administration hasn't picked up on this over the last 20 years, I think requires the city ordinance to step in and require the city, Mr. President, to act on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8741.139s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8742.139s">I</a>  have a double pole in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8745.301s">Mr.</a>  President, I wasn't done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8748.383s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8749.083s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8750.904s">So</a>  if I could have a B paper for the DPW to look at the sidewalk panel in front of, to actually the side, it's a corner lot, the corner of Honeywell and, uh,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8760.488s">Bradshaw,</a>  it's 49 Bradshaw Street.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8765.192s">It's</a>  a B paper to 17446. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8765.732s">And</a>  if we could also have Bradshaw.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8790.734s">in</a>  Honeywell, it's the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8793.776s">It's</a>  a raised sidewalk panel.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8797.479s">And</a>  you have another one, sir?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8801.221s">Yes,</a>  if we could have the DPW department or whatever utility is responsible for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8807.606s">There</a>  is not a half pole, not a double pole, it's a mini pole at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8814.331s">It's</a>  gotta be about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8816.988s">Definite</a>  safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8818.128s">I</a>  mean, there's kids all over the place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8820.169s">It's</a>  not a tree stump. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8821.049s">It's</a>  a telephone pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8822.029s">It</a>  used to be a double pole.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8823.27s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8823.83s">And</a>  then they cut it down and it's like a mini pole.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8826.79s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8828.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8829.611s">Councilor</a>  Lundquist.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8830.851s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8832.632s">I</a>  actually have more to say about potholes, but I want to thank my colleague for putting this forward and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8839.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8841.594s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8842.634s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8843.855s">I</a>  think it's important to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8846.652s">Here</a>  in the city, we have two stump lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8848.333s">We</a>  have one stump list that the city is responsible for and one stump list that the public utility is responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8852.894s">And</a>  I think that Councilor Marksley is on the right track as part of the permitting process for our public utilities to come into the community to dig up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8859.356s">They</a>  should also be required to take down the stumps on the trees that they've taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8862.878s">So</a>  I think that's a nice place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8864.718s">It's</a>  certainly a good, a good intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8867.459s">And</a>  I think it's going to lead us in the right direction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8870.605s">In</a>  terms of the $250,000 for our business district, I think that nothing can improve our business districts more than improving the flow of traffic and making them more pedestrian safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8878.947s">With</a>  that being said, I'm pretty sure that a traffic engineer will cost less than $250,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8884.268s">I'm</a>  sure we could probably get two years of a traffic engineer out of $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8886.748s">So</a>  with that being said, that would be a recommendation that I would like to make as an amendment to Councilor Falco's B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8893.95s">Also,</a>  Mr. President,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8897.602s">Did</a>  you get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8899.904s">Add</a>  a trap.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8900.304s">$250,000</a>  be spent for a traffic engineer as opposed to business district beautification because ultimately if we improve the flow of traffic and we make our community more pedestrian friendly, we are going to be improving our business districts and we're going to be improving the quality of life of our city as a whole, not just in these five areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8917.455s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8918.456s">Um,</a>  so with that being said, I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8920.537s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8921.177s">Councilor</a>  Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8922.318s">I</a>  yell to the gentleman who approached the podium.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8925.754s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8926.995s">Paul</a>  Gucciati, 37 Dunin Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8929.396s">I</a>  just want to acknowledge the double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8931.397s">We've</a>  had a double pole for more than five years in Dunin Street and I'll hit the potholes in a few minutes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8938.72s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8939.18s">Councilor</a>  Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8940.201s">Again,</a>  I, I, and I'll hop on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8941.901s">I</a>  think that one of my, my biggest issues coming onto the council is the lack of respect from our public utilities, um, and replacing panels and still, that's still an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8953.447s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8955.263s">I'd</a>  like an update if we can, if we could med that to still ask the DPW if they can identify panels that haven't been replaced yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8971.369s">What</a>  I'm seeing is still, they were supposed to be, what we've been told is that they were supposed to be put back to what was originally there, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8979.992s">And</a>  what we're seeing is, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8982.113s">concrete</a>  sidewalks that are now being hot topped over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8987.575s">And</a>  as we all know that over time that disintegrates and it leaves a huge safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8994.577s">So</a>  if we can ask the DPW for that, that'd be, that'd be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8998.458s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9001.123s">I've</a>  been waiting for a similar response from the engineering department since April of 2016 relative to the streets that have been dug up by our public utilities and the trench work that's been performed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9012.548s">I've</a>  put forward more than five resolutions on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9014.929s">It's</a>  been 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9017.05s">I'm</a>  going to make a friendly wager with Councilor Scarpelli that if he gets his list before I get mine, I'll take him out for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9026.613s">You're</a>  not going to be that lucky if I win.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9093.189s">Let</a>  me preface my remarks, Mr. President, if I could, because I don't want this to reflect upon DPW and the highway department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9103.072s">And</a>  in my discussions, the highway department, which is responsible for the maintenance of our roads, sidewalks, currently right now to operate efficiently and effectively, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9118.137s">to</a>  address the issues that are reported through C-Click Fix, through this council, through residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9123.68s">They</a>  need an additional six workers just to meet the daily requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9128.562s">So</a>  they're down six workers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9131.703s">So</a>  I don't want this in any way to reflect upon a department, in my opinion, that is sorely, sorely understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9139.767s">But</a>  I had to bring it up tonight because I don't like what I'm seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9142.708s">You</a>  know, I've been driving in this community for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9147.272s">And</a>  I can unequivocally say I've never seen our roads in worse condition, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9153.739s">I've</a>  never seen them in worse condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9155.761s">And</a>  now I'm seeing, Mr. President, and I don't know if my council colleagues have noticed, people are starting to paint orange neon around potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9165.691s">So</a>  I inquired when I saw them, I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9167.924s">Geez,</a>  why are people putting orange neon? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9170.186s">It's</a>  actually nice because I know to avoid the pothole, but I was told it's being done by residents, Mr. President, that are so sick and tired of having the same pothole on their street for month after month, year after year, Mr. President, some of these potholes, that they're actually calling light to these particular potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9190.222s">And</a>  they look like mini crime scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9192.443s">It</a>  looks like almost a body was there, Mr. President, based on the size of the pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9198.587s">In</a>  addition to the potholes, Mr. President, that for whatever reason, and maybe it's because we're understaffed, we're unable to keep on top of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9207.993s">And</a>  I'm not sure why. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9209.154s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9210.354s">Maybe</a>  our streets are so old that this is what we're faced with now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9215.097s">You</a>  know, maybe we should have had <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9216.762s">a</a>  systematic approach to replacing our streets, which never happened over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9221.804s">But</a>  we're at a place right now where there's in such deplorable condition, just patching a hole really doesn't do it merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9232.388s">And</a>  the manhole covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9234.915s">How</a>  many streets do you have to go down and avoid the manhole cover? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9238.358s">Because</a>  it's sloping down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9241.201s">How</a>  many streets do you have to go over that you have to say, well, I've got to avoid this manhole cover? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9245.405s">Or</a>  if I get too close to the curb, I get near a catch basin that's almost sunk into the ground, and I have to avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9252.032s">It's</a>  like you're playing a Nintendo game when you're driving on these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9255.976s">They're</a>  that deplorable, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9258.605s">And</a>  I'm not sure what it's gonna take. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9261.467s">We</a>  hear about complete streets, we hear about this is going on, that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9266.651s">It's</a>  the very basics that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9270.113s">It's</a>  the very basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9271.734s">And</a>  when you tell a resident that their taxes have gone up steadily each year for 25 years, while the city services are going down, saying, well, you know what, we can't afford to do the basic maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9283.495s">We</a>  can't afford to do the basic city maintenance, Mr. President, that we need to do in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9289.5s">And</a>  again, the number of e-mails and calls I get, it's getting overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9294.624s">And</a>  I asked people, I said, you may be better off reporting it to see click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9299.467s">And</a>  I think the frustration with that is they get a quick answer saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9303.312s">It</a>  will take it under advisement and nothing ever happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9306.934s">So</a>  I hate to do it, Mr. President, but I have to put a few roads on there that were brought to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9313.796s">And</a>  I know people are going to say, well, it's every road, and I agree with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9317.178s">But</a>  Tamar Drive has a hole that you can lose a small car in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9321.399s">That's</a>  how bad it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9323.68s">Salem</a>  Street still has the railroad tracks from 1930 that ran down Salem Street that you can see through the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9330.723s">How</a>  long have I been asking for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9333.028s">How</a>  long? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9333.348s">I</a>  mean, talk about your request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9336.014s">I</a>  mean, you're talking a year, two years that you can still see the tracks underneath, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9342.328s">Riverside</a>  Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9344.377s">between</a>  the slopes and the catch basins and the manhole covers and Winthrop Street towards Boston Ave, another area that is in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9356.666s">The</a>  raised crosswalk should be painted every year so people know there's a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9362.61s">You</a>  go by it, you can barely tell the difference between the raised crosswalk and the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9367.31s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9368.431s">Secondly,</a>  we talk about crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9370.872s">How</a>  often do we talk about getting our crosswalks painted? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9374.675s">I'd</a>  venture to say that 70 percent of our crosswalks, still to date, are not painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9381.079s">To</a>  date, Mr. President, are not painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9383.66s">We</a>  had the Traffic Commission several weeks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9387.943s">An</a>  amendment was offered before the Traffic Commission to allow Medford Police to now tag for jaywalking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9394.069s">Apparently</a>  they didn't have the ability to tag for jaywalking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9397.473s">Jaywalking,</a>  from my understanding, is crossing a street that is not in a recommended cross area, like a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9404.781s">Unfortunately,</a>  how do you tell residents to cross in a crosswalk that's not painted and not visual to those that are driving in the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9413.314s">So</a>  it doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9415.796s">This</a>  council has voted, I know you brought it up several occasions, and I've mentioned it ad nauseam for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9422.923s">Thermoplastic</a>  crosswalks, highly reflective, slip-resistant, their life expectancy is five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9432.132s">Are</a>  they a little more expensive? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9433.493s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9435.42s">The</a>  state uses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9437.1s">They</a>  use it on state highways, state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9439.761s">Oh,</a>  no, the city of Medford knows better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9441.541s">We</a>  can't use thermoplastic in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9443.981s">Oh,</a>  no, it's too expensive, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9446.322s">We'll</a>  just have to fight every year to get our crosswalks painted for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9450.743s">And</a>  by the time they get done, it's wintertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9453.923s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't know what's going on, but, you know, I'm tired of hearing about all these little niches that are out there, safe roads and safe streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9462.765s">And</a>  this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9464.358s">And</a>  that's all it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9466.238s">It's</a>  only a little niche, and it doesn't address the entire city's needs, which are basic needs, streets and sidewalks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9474.68s">So,</a>  again, I would ask that we have our pothole patrol team, which I guess it sounds good to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9481.722s">I</a>  don't think we have one, but we get our pothole patrol team out there and start filling these potholes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9489.516s">And</a>  if they can't get the substance to fill them, we can get creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9494.958s">Other</a>  communities, you know what they've done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9496.539s">They've</a>  done adopt a site. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9498.96s">It</a>  may sound dangerous, but you have people that will go and adopt a pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9503.082s">They'll</a>  fill it with cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9504.342s">They'll</a>  make pitches in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9505.743s">They'll</a>  do mosaics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9507.603s">And</a>  it really, it's actually very catchy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9510.865s">But</a>  this is how their approach is to getting the city to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9514.906s">And</a>  maybe our approach is to do neon around the potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9517.988s">And</a>  I think it's effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9519.979s">I</a>  thank the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9520.92s">I</a>  hope they don't get hurt doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9522.322s">But</a>  I thank the residents because it calls the pothole to attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9525.264s">And</a>  I think it puts people in the city on notice, saying, hey, look, how long is this going to last? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9530.429s">And</a>  we're going to call you out on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9532.631s">We're</a>  going to outline it in neon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9535.294s">I</a>  hate to be winded about it, Mr. President, but these are basic needs that aren't being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9540.899s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9543.521s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9545.142s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9546.523s">I</a>  was going to put this on under suspension, the pothole part of it, because I too, but I thank Councilor Marks for beating me to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9555.43s">The</a>  pothole problem, I've never seen, I don't think I've ever seen it so bad in my 16 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9563.196s">Everywhere</a>  you drive, you are dodging, you are dodging your tire from being blown out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9569.44s">Everywhere</a>  I walk in my neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9571.892s">I've</a>  been snapping pictures like crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9573.954s">I've</a>  been getting complaints like crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9576.135s">And</a>  in my neighborhood where I live, there's no circles in neon yellow, but my neighbors are putting sand in the potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9584.942s">Whether</a>  or not that's a good or safe thing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9587.564s">But</a>  I've gone around and I'm looking at potholes I saw a couple weeks ago, and they're filled with sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9592.167s">So</a>  I think it does probably help the car, but whether or not residents should be putting sand in it is obviously a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9599.51s">But</a>  I think it just goes to show how frustrated people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9602.872s">And</a>  I don't know what the problem is either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9605.693s">And</a>  every time I do contact the DPW, they do respond to my concerns, and they go and fill the potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9614.438s">But</a>  some sections where it needs to be completely dug up and re-put in, whether that's a portion of the street or a larger section of the road, that's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9625.863s">We</a>  just don't have the time or the manpower to do it, and that's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9629.446s">We're</a>  putting quick fixes on some and not on others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9632.147s">So</a>  I think we need a systematic approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9634.768s">And</a>  if we need to put more money in to doing it or hire a private contractor to go street by street, it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9642.691s">If</a>  you look on Highland and Rita, there are huge potholes and a catch basin almost completely fallen in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9655.336s">You</a>  go to Doonan Street, there are <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9657.877s">patch</a>  after patch after patch that keeps coming up, and you have crumbling road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9665.339s">If</a>  you look on Short Street, there are potholes filled with sand, and this is just my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9671.901s">Then</a>  you go down, and you go down Bell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9674.522s">Some</a>  have been fixed, thankfully, but you go to the end of Bell Ave, and it's a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9679.323s">It</a>  is an absolute mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9680.484s">That</a>  road's always considered a roller coaster in my family, Roller Coaster Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9685.153s">But</a>  you go to every adjacent street, it's just pothole after pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9689.276s">And</a>  we need to figure out a way to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9691.598s">So</a>  I'm asking, through an amendment, that our subcommittee or even a committee of the whole meet with the DPW director and say, if we're only getting to some of these complaints on C-Click Fix, it's not enough, and what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9705.407s">Because</a>  it's been talked about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9707.889s">We</a>  have $250,000 for our streets that we may or may not approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9711.451s">That</a>  survey, by the way, I believe already went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9714.378s">to</a>  the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9715.739s">I</a>  have seen it online, so people are, I believe, starting, they're requesting people to fill that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9722.522s">We</a>  need basic city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9725.004s">This</a>  happens every few years where it just gets so bad that this council's left saying, please, just fill potholes, paint the sidewalks, fix signage that needs to be, I mean, just the simple things that need to be done for the residents, for the safety of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9741.952s">I'd</a>  love to know how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9743.949s">Pothole</a>  tire bus are in our law department right now with regards to, you know, people seeking reimbursement because it's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9753.414s">And</a>  I think we need to figure out a way, I think Committee of the Whole might be the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9758.136s">And</a>  just to ask questions, what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9760.337s">Are</a>  we going street by street? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9761.558s">Are</a>  we just going based on complaints? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9764.019s">Because</a>  based on complaints isn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9766.721s">It</a>  really isn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9767.581s">And</a>  every week I'm getting new complaints about potholes alone, crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9773.963s">That's</a>  another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9775.104s">But</a>  for me, the complaints are really, really coming in with regards to the potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9779.567s">And</a>  you see it as you're walking or driving around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9783.029s">And</a>  I really think something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9785.031s">I</a>  think we need to get a grasp on it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9787.713s">I</a>  know we will do that come June when we meet with the DPW director in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9792.436s">But</a>  I think that's too far to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9793.897s">I</a>  think within the next couple weeks, we should sit down and say, what can we do to help, what can we <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9800.548s">do</a>  to ask this administration to make sure we have enough fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9803.929s">Is</a>  that a problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9804.669s">Do</a>  we have enough fill? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9805.949s">Do</a>  we not have enough manpower? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9808.97s">What</a>  are we, what are we doing wrong or what can we do right to make this right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9813.371s">Um,</a>  because it's, it's just extremely unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9816.372s">It's</a>  unsightly and it's something we need to get a handle on.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9819.872s">June</a>  is in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9821.353s">Councilor</a>  Knights.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9822.773s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9823.513s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9824.253s">I</a>  moved to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9825.354s">I</a>  have several amendments I'd like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9827.757s">Back</a>  in 2016, I filed a resolution requesting that the DPW, namely the engineering department, provide us with an estimate as to what it would cost to totally resurface the emergency arteries in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9839.826s">They</a>  came back with an estimate of $6.75 million at that time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9844.489s">I'd</a>  ask for an updated cost estimate as to what it would cost to resurface the emergency arteries in the city of Medford, Clerk Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9854.436s">And</a>  I'd also like to ask when each street <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9857.687s">that</a>  is designated as an emergency artery was last resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9864.232s">Second</a>  Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9864.792s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to make a, would be this, um, back about eight months ago, the Medford city council recommended that the DPW division, um, examine the feasibility of creating a standalone signage and striping department to address some of the concerns that we have relative to signage and striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9881.805s">Makes</a>  sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9883.361s">So</a>  I'd ask for an update, Mr. President, as we prepare for the budget, I'd like to reiterate the council's position that this is something that we'd like to see examined and potentially be placed in the DPW budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9894.145s">And</a>  third, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper requesting that the engineering division provide written response to the Medford City Council as to why paper 16404 has not been answered yet after a year and a half.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9908.151s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9909.191s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9910.011s">I</a>  want to thank my council colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9912.48s">Councilor</a>  Marksley, bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9915.561s">This</a>  is definitely a concern in every neighborhood throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9918.943s">And</a>  I would definitely be in favor of having a committee, the whole meeting to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9925.066s">It's,</a>  you know, we talk about emergency arteries, but this is just everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9928.748s">I</a>  mean, you go to, you can go to probably every side street, you're going to find something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9933.09s">But</a>  I mean, there are some major issues throughout our community, in every neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9938.632s">And</a>  I get calls about them, just like my colleagues do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9943.826s">If</a>  I could add the lower half of Fern Road to that list, there is a hole that's getting bigger by the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9952.331s">So</a>  if we could add that on, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9955.733s">It</a>  needs to be addressed because someone is seriously gonna do some serious damage to their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9960.876s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9962.677s">Thank</a>  you, and it was a request that I made, I think two years ago, asking for a permanent sidewalk crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9971.64s">They</a>  were just two sidewalks every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9975.262s">We're</a>  still waiting an answer for that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9978.004s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9980.586s">Last</a>  weekend, a resolution with regard to see click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9985.269s">If</a>  we could just get an update as to when we're going to receive that list, because it would be beneficial to all of us that we receive that list before the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9993.835s">Because,</a>  you know, you talk about, you know, staffing and we all need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9999.779s">We</a>  all know that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10001.6s">more</a>  people on that department, but you get a true indication when you take a look at that, see quick fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10006.702s">You</a>  can use it as a tool, you know, to actually see what's not getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10010.704s">And</a>  I think it would tell a good picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10013.005s">So</a>  if we could get an update as to when we will receive that, greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10018.047s">And</a>  address the director, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10019.247s">Paul</a>  Gucciari, 37 Duden street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10021.088s">So</a>  I just want to thank everybody and acknowledge your Councilors for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10025.15s">But</a>  I got some ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10027.25s">One</a>  is I heard $7 million today you have in the water fund, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10031.509s">reappropriate</a>  some of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10033.872s">to</a>  repair the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10035.892s">I</a>  know you're shaking your head, but you gotta look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10039.913s">You</a>  get free cash and so, and another thing I would suggest, you said you're short staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10045.394s">Contractors,</a>  bring them in during the spring, during the fall, get them to repair the roads, it gets done, you're not adding much overhead, you're not paying for healthcare, things like that, they're not permanent on the payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10057.956s">I</a>  would also suggest what you said, 30 days for the trees not being cut, the stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10062.537s">Establish</a>  service level agreements with the different departments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10066.506s">So</a>  30 days to do some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10067.93s">If</a>  they're not done, you fine them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10070.571s">I</a>  live with that every day in my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10072.532s">If</a>  I don't do something for the customer within a certain amount of time, I owe them money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10077.695s">So</a>  you could work something out like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10079.936s">Another</a>  idea is, as the police are patrolling the streets, maybe they could take some notes, turn it in in their daily report, and say, I see a pothole there, I see a pothole there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10091.063s">I</a>  saw the orange signs last summer on the streets going by LaCasse's on the way to work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10096.846s">I</a>  said, oh, finally, the city's going to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10099.505s">Did</a>  it get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10100.226s">No,</a>  the paint just wore out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10103.187s">So</a>  all I can say is, as you're talking to the departments, is there any pride in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10109.672s">If</a>  you have pride in the city, then something will be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10113.494s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10114.155s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10117.097s">Councilor</a>  Knights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10118.578s">Mr.</a>  President, the gentleman makes a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10120.699s">In</a>  other communities that surround the city, namely the city of Boston, which is very successful in the delivery of <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10127.265s">public</a>  works projects based upon, especially based upon the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10130.59s">One</a>  of the things that they've implemented in the city of Boston, I believe, would be a residency requirement for department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10136.16s">And</a>  I think that that's something that might warrant a little bit of examination, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10140.941s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, if someone lives in the community and they have to go to the same supermarket that we have to go to and listen to the same complaints that we have to listen to and the same concerns that we're here for and here to address, I just think it makes them take a little bit more pride in their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10153.024s">Because</a>  I know, as I think back to a former gentleman that was working in our school department, and he was called to the carpet for some actions, and the quote in the newspaper was, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10164.215s">Well,</a>  it's very easy for this gentleman to get in his car and drive up to Bellingham at the end, uh, Beverly at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10169.598s">But</a>  those of us that live in this community and call it home, care about it and care what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10174.54s">And</a>  we have a vested interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10175.58s">And</a>  I think that that's something that we might want to examine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10177.601s">Mr.</a>  President move approval on the question.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10179.662s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10180.043s">Councilor</a>  Knight on the motion by vice president marks seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Falco Councilor knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10193.449s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10205.574s">And</a>  if we if we could request that we have a council of the whole meeting as soon as possible to discuss these matters Yes This is we're gonna do this paper <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10220.688s">And</a>  then we'll be recommended that we have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10225.65s">I</a>  will call a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10228.471s">I</a>  will call a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10231.212s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10233.233s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10236.674s">For</a>  just a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10237.712s">Councilman,</a>  I'd just like to take an opportunity to thank the tree warden and the forestry division. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10244.379s">Two</a>  weeks ago, we put forward a request asking for a tree to be replaced in front of 112 Grant Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10249.044s">That</a>  work's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10249.885s">It</a>  was done like in two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10251.887s">So</a>  I'm very thankful for the work that they do, and I appreciate their prompt response to the inquiry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10257.232s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10271.706s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10272.967s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, after <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10275.961s">brief</a>  illness, Mr. Meadows passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10278.562s">Services</a>  were held yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10280.823s">He</a>  was a great fellow, a gentleman that always opened the doors to his home and let us kids run wild in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10286.926s">He</a>  kept letting us come back day after day and year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10289.707s">And</a>  he was really just a great individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10291.548s">He</a>  had a great sense of community, a great sense of pride in his neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10295.25s">And</a>  he will be sadly missed down on Bradshaw Street, Mr. President, and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10298.511s">I'd</a>  move for approval of the paper and ask my council colleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family.</p>

    <p>[l7j4K8jolL8_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10333.858s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10334.239s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10336.24s">A</a>  couple of weeks ago, one of the houses on my street got flipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10343.085s">And</a>  while everything was above board, I'm not complaining about the way it was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10347.188s">It</a>  was within the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10348.709s">But</a>  I just want to make people aware of a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10352.832s">First</a>  of all, is the human interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10355.063s">the</a>  human side of it, which is that I would encourage mother-in-law apartments or father-in-law apartments or sons or whatever, because it's better than warehousing them in a nursing home or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10368.614s">If</a>  you can't afford $5,000 to $6,000, $7,000 a month, then you end up farming them out into large facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10377.922s">So</a>  that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10378.723s">Number</a>  two, developers come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10384.76s">They</a>  swoop in like vultures. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10387.401s">This</a>  is a hot city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10389.121s">It's</a>  been hot for three or four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10391.742s">And</a>  if I collected all of the postcards and letters that I get from real estate people and developers, I would look like Santa Claus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10400.044s">I</a>  would have a bag filled with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10403.445s">They</a>  come in, and in this case, it happened to me on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10408.927s">Not</a>  that it's going to make or break the city, the street, that one house was converted <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10414.205s">to</a>  two condos that was originally a single-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10418.629s">They</a>  had a mother-in-law apartment, and they got permission to turn it into a two-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10423.953s">This</a>  is a single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10425.574s">They</a>  took out all the green grass in the back so that they could have the parking that's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10430.118s">So</a>  now you lost the green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10432.319s">And</a>  I'll get to that, but I have a chip on my shoulder about developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10436.182s">So</a>  I want to get that off my chest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10439.745s">Developers</a>  come in here from outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10441.967s">They</a>  flip at the house, and they leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10445.067s">that's</a>  great for them, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10447.628s">And</a>  the other thing is, you guys were talking about water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10451.068s">Development</a>  doesn't mean it's good for me and my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10456.349s">When</a>  they built across the way, they pitched the driveway, so now the water came into my basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10462.711s">So</a>  I used to have a little flower bed, not much, a little mulch, little flowers, little few rocks with the bricks around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10469.492s">I</a>  had to pave over that because I had to raise my pitch <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10473.914s">so</a>  that now it goes back down to the street, and then down the street, so it was great for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10478.996s">The</a>  other thing, the third point, and I'm trying to be quick, I know it's late, but I want to make you aware that, the third point was, conflicts, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10490.099s">Conflicts</a>  between neighbors, fences make good neighbors, and when you have a single family house that had the second floor turned into, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10500.567s">a</a>  mother-in-law apartment, which at least they're family, so they're connected, they're relational, it's not so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10505.732s">But</a>  when you turn, the base of the house is going to be bigger than the upstairs, then you have to put in new, totally new boilers, totally new infrastructure, and who's going to be responsible to shovel the driveway in the winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10521.946s">If</a>  you look at that property, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10523.996s">They,</a>  they're going to the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10525.917s">They</a>  could have arguments over who's going to shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10528.319s">They</a>  could have arguments over paying the insurance bill, the insurance bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10532.322s">Now,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10533.683s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10535.004s">One</a>  of the major counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10536.365s">I</a>  do believe the majority of the issues that, um, the speaker is discussing would be outlined in the condo documents or the HOA documents that would be established when a multifamily house becomes condominiums and that gets filed with the registry of deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10548.694s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10549.054s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[l7j4K8jolL8_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10550.115s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10550.656s">And</a>  I do agree with that except for one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10553.041s">If</a>  you're dealing with just two people or two entities and one doesn't pay their side of the bill, that insurance policy gets canceled if the other person doesn't pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10565.53s">So</a>  these are conflicts that you're bringing on for no good reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10569.173s">You</a>  do not have to, and I thank you for your point, but you do not have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10576.479s">This</a>  is optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10578.8s">This</a>  is unlike my house where it changed from a family <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10583.549s">situation</a>  where I had my aunt downstairs, and everybody was relational. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10587.472s">We</a>  didn't have a contract growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10590.053s">There</a>  was no contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10591.574s">And</a>  then I had to rent it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10595.036s">It's</a>  something that I had to do in order to survive, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10599.239s">But</a>  this is an option to turn a single-family house with a mother-in-law or father-in-law apartment into a two-family or a two-condo, because now you're adding more stress to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10610.546s">That</a>  doesn't have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10612.387s">But</a>  it's just because the developer wants to make more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10615.508s">This</a>  is a money incentive for somebody living outside the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10618.909s">And</a>  it's completely unnecessary to have to do it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10622.891s">It's</a>  great for the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10624.671s">They</a>  make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10625.772s">But</a>  then the conflicts that can happen between these two condos when you do it with a two-family house, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10630.693s">It</a>  doesn't matter if it's a single family with a mother-in-law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10633.484s">or</a>  a two-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10634.365s">When</a>  you do this, if one partner doesn't keep up their grass, you're on top of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10641.289s">It's</a>  bad enough when they're next door and there's 10 or 12 feet between the property lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10646.172s">Now</a>  you're literally living up and down, and you're thumping, and there's no hierarchy of authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10653.316s">And</a>  it would bury you in legal costs <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10657.713s">You're</a>  one person up against the other person, and they both have legal standing in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10662.895s">I</a>  have a 22-page contract with my tenant to protect me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10667.397s">And</a>  unlike when I was growing up, I didn't have to worry about putting everything in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10672.018s">Today,</a>  you have to put everything in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10673.979s">Unfortunately,</a>  that's just the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10675.6s">And</a>  the feel of the house is different than when it was relatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10678.841s">I</a>  used to go into my aunt's kitchen and right into the fridge and grab a Popsicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10683.563s">That</a>  feel is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10684.97s">And</a>  that is a loss to me, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10687.292s">So,</a>  but it's unnecessary growth or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10691.636s">Sell</a>  it as a single family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10693.617s">There's</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10694.598s">You</a>  just don't make as much profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10696.259s">That's</a>  the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10696.96s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10698.181s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10699.622s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to receive in place on file.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10702.585s">Mr.</a>  President, I feel as though the market controls what it is that developers are seeking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10708.069s">And</a>  as we see the baby boomer generation reach a certain age right now where they're looking to downsize, there is a demand for condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10713.927s">in</a>  our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10714.587s">That's</a>  why in the past I've brought forward requests to work with the city assessor to discuss condo conversion and whether or not we need a bylaw to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10723.273s">But</a>  I feel as though the market controls exactly what it is that would happen in development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10728.077s">And</a>  right now there is a push towards condominium living, and I believe it's attributable to the fact that the baby boomer generation is reaching an age where they're seeking downsize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10737.203s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10738.984s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10740.425s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10742.666s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10744.08s">Reports</a>  of committee 17382, subcommittee on environmental affairs committee report regarding municipal aggregation from May 9th, 2017 subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10757.53s">The</a>  subcommittee met on May 9th with several residents in attendance along with Councilors to discuss municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10771.86s">The</a>  recommendation of the committee was to send the paper to the Committee of Whole for discussion with the whole body of councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10783.75s">Motion</a>  to accept that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10786.572s">Question,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10788.013s">Councilor</a>  Naith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10788.974s">I</a>  do believe that this paper has been before the Committee of the Whole on two previous occasions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10792.897s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10793.737s">Sent</a>  to subcommittee for recommendations on how to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10796.239s">Are</a>  there any recommendations that are coming out of the subcommittee as to how they'd like to <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10799.939s">recommend</a>  the committee of the whole proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10801.8s">Is</a>  there a presentation of some sort that's going to be performed?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10804.861s">There</a>  was, there was no, uh, there was a presentation made that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10807.863s">Um,</a>  and there was some discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10811.445s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks, you can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10814.266s">You</a>  are the chairman of that subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10817.168s">Mr.</a>  President, that meeting was set up at a request at the Committee of the Whole by Councilor Dello Russo to have further dialogue, and that's exactly what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10828.255s">We</a>  invited Alicia Hunt from the Energy and Environment Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10832.077s">We</a>  also invited Curtis Tooden, who is the committee chairman of Energy Environment Commission, and he gave a thorough explanation on green initiatives that <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10845.545s">we</a>  as a council could do because it's based on city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10849.847s">And</a>  he also gave a presentation on the need for municipal aggregation in this community, which I think we all heard already. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10859.21s">So</a>  I'm not sure if there's anything new to add to the dialogue and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10863.751s">We</a>  did do our due diligence as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10865.852s">We</a>  met, we listened to residents input, and we decided that ultimately it'll be a vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10872.174s">And</a>  there was one caveat that was mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10876.54s">City</a>  Solicitor Mark Rumley was present at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10879.644s">He</a>  was asked by myself to reach out to House Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10886.1s">which</a>  is before the state legislature, and ask whether or not we as a city can file a home rule petition to actually craft the current state law a little differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10897.569s">Right</a>  now, if we were to vote on this municipal aggregation, everyone by default would be opted into the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10905.555s">So</a>  residents don't have a say, everyone's opted in by default. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10909.896s">Now</a>  you have an opt-out clause that you can do to get out of the program if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10915.038s">My</a>  request to the city solicitor was to see if we can reverse that and have it be an opt-in clause, where if people are interested in joining municipal aggregation, that the city move forward and we set up a pool of people that are interested in going into municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10933.065s">And</a>  according to the city solicitor, with home rule petitions, the state legislature doesn't like to alter a law in a way that takes from the original intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10946.375s">And</a>  he felt that by doing the opt-in was not doing away with the original intent, and so did House Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10953.48s">So</a>  he said that could be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10956.422s">If</a>  we as a body, and that's one of the things that was presented that night, wanted to have the paper sent to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, because the paper has to originate, has been passed practice by the mayor, to offer a home rule petition with an opt-in clause. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10976.153s">And</a>  that's where it stands, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10977.594s">I</a>  think we're all aware of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10979.535s">I</a>  don't think there's any magic smoking gun that's going to come out of any particular subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10984.837s">Um,</a>  it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10985.778s">Um,</a>  and if people don't know what it is, then members of the council should ask questions to Alicia hunt or, uh, through the mass municipal association or, or, or even surrounding communities that are moving forward on it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=10999.584s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11000.044s">Mr.</a>  Vice president, the motion by council night that we accept the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11004.977s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11006.759s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11008.32s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11009.801s">The</a>  records were passed to Councilor DelaRosa who has gone home ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11017.648s">So</a>  I ask that they be tabled until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11021.13s">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=11023.472s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Salazar.</p>
