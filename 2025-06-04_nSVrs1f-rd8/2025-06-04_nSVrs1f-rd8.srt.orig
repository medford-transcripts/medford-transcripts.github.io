1
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:38,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everybody.

2
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:57,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Okie dokie, looks like everyone is here right now.

3
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a quorum anyway, not everybody, everybody on the committee.

4
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:08,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we can go ahead and get started.

5
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:14,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Clark, I always forget, when we're on Zoom, we have to call the roll or not, or can we just go?

6
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:18,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the meeting is on Zoom, you do have to call the roll.

7
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

8
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:24,699
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting.

9
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

10
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a second, please.

11
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta let Councilor Callahan in.

12
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:31,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on just a quick second.

13
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here comes the roll call.

14
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:36,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan?

15
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:37,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

16
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:39,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lozaro?

17
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:40,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

18
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:42,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

19
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:44,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see Councilor Scarpella.

20
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:45,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Seng?

21
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

22
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:47,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Lemming?

23
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

24
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: For present, one absent.

25
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is called to order.

26
00:12:52,281 --> 00:13:04,050
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing we're going to do is try to knock out this newsletter, which was so graciously drafted by Councilor Lazaro.

27
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for

28
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,058
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling up all of those links.

29
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:09,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to go.

30
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many links.

31
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, especially during budget season.

32
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:27,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was really fun, creative linking there, especially with it felt like it wasn't necessary to have a new bullet point for every single board and commission.

33
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just linked where it says every link, board link, and link

34
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:39,732
[SPEAKER_02]: commission link for each of the boards and commissions.

35
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:45,159
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried to make it a little bit less painful to read, just a little bit more readable that way.

36
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, yeah, see, there it is.

37
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:53,469
[SPEAKER_02]: All of Medford's boards and commissions.

38
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,211
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fun, that was fun.

39
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,546
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was painstaking.

40
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:01,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah, take a look, let me know.

41
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:01,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

42
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:17,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically the only edits that I made to this draft, and this is the formatted version where I added the Memorial Day resolution and yeah, tracking those suspended resolutions is always a little.

43
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:17,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

44
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:18,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed those.

45
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they weren't.

46
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:20,833
[SPEAKER_02]: On the website.

47
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, no, that's I've done that multiple times before the resolutions under suspension are hard to keep track of.

48
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I added what we're doing today.

49
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:37,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So, assuming that we do get done with these two things might as well just throw that on retroactively.

50
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:52,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I added yesterday's meeting, uh, saying we hosted facilities manager Paul right here to offer an update to the city council regarding the estimated costs of repairing and maintaining all city on facilities in the future.

51
00:14:52,327 --> 00:15:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and let's see, what else did I just a quick point of information chair looming.

52
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, his name is pronounced Paul Ricky.

53
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot.

54
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

55
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,046
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't that many people in this meeting to catch my.

56
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,027
[SPEAKER_02]: For the future.

57
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:17,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I'm sure that my pronunciation will be correct over text in this newsletter.

58
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:30,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also added just an extra link to the planning and permitting committee because this other corridors business was discussed on both May 14th and May 28th.

59
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:31,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Seng.

60
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um, you can go through your stuff first.

61
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:48,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um, well, I think I'm just trying, I'm just trying to look and remember, but I think I want to say that that was about it.

62
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Just those couple of those extra meetings.

63
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:52,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

64
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:58,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few details that were missed, but overall, yeah, this was a pretty, you know, it was, it was good job.

65
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, feel free to bring up what you'd,

66
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,200
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, whatever was on your mind.

67
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

68
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:12,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for the HRC ordinance, um, I would probably just mention that it like empower, empowers the HRC to do more somehow.

69
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think it's kind of an effective, like to make it more effective, but, um, maybe, I mean, if you can, can I, can you, okay, there, there we go.

70
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's line 204, right?

71
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:27,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

72
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Prove for first reading the governance ordinance for HRC.

73
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:57,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe instead of which will make it run, to empower it to run more effectively and respond to new challenges, I don't know, something like that.

74
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:08,682
[SPEAKER_04]: On May 13th, after much review and committee, we approve for first reading the governing ordinance from Edwards Human Rights Commission to empower it to run more effectively and respond to new challenges.

75
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that's my note for that one.

76
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:18,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And then generally, there's another, um, there was the common Vic one.

77
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, right above it for 203.

78
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:20,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It reads like,

79
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:28,496
[SPEAKER_03]: we voted for it to stay open on that one particular day on May 10th.

80
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:35,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the right to stay open on May 10th of every year.

81
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

82
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:39,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Good catch.

83
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just generally, I don't know if Veterans is capitalized.

84
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:48,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Not until 1 AM forever though, like on every day.

85
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

86
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know which?

87
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:59,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think we approved them to stay open until, well, this is actually something that is going to come up a lot more for us.

88
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:12,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, all of our businesses, we're aligning them with their common victualers license and their liquor licenses are often misaligned.

89
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're bringing them into alignment.

90
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:20,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes their liquor licenses say they can stay open later than their convicts do.

91
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what we did for the establishment was we told them that they can stay open till 1 a.m.

92
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:28,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't always do it.

93
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:34,846
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what kind of happens with many restaurants is they have the capacity to stay open later.

94
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And they- I think it was on weekends.

95
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was during the week.

96
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, but usually- That's possible.

97
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:43,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way that the licenses work

98
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:47,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

99
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

100
00:18:48,399 --> 00:19:05,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a meeting about this with a couple of people from City Hall about how a lot of people's approvals say that they actually can stay open until one, and then they have this other approval that says they can't.

101
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually whatever's latest is the thing that it applies to.

102
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we're working on.

103
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,098
[SPEAKER_02]: getting aligned.

104
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:23,582
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that being said, I don't remember specifically what it was, except that they were asking to stay open till one, we approved it.

105
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the details.

106
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:34,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like- I only mentioned it because this is the kind of thing like restaurants staying open until one is a kind of thing that occasionally some residents are not happy about.

107
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:42,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know they're kind of a part, they're not in a residential area, so it's probably fine, but- They are in the first floor of a building where people live, so.

108
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:46,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is to some degree residential over there.

109
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: They are?

110
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:49,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that was mixed use there.

111
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, yeah, I think so.

112
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me pull up the agenda and look at what the paperwork says actually.

113
00:19:56,741 --> 00:20:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor is saying, oh, you put your hand down.

114
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I covered everything I wanted to say.

115
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:09,851
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing was just, I think we're choosing to capitalize veterans generally.

116
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:13,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's common use, but yeah.

117
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:16,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

118
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

119
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:20,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that important.

120
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:25,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we should be, we should have it be correct based on it.

121
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:28,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

122
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:37,168
[SPEAKER_04]: My impression of this was that if we're like referring to the veteran's office, it's I mean, yeah, yeah, we, we can.

123
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:39,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That's we'd like, that's fine.

124
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, sure.

125
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:51,513
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I have the piece from the packet.

126
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:54,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every day.

127
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:58,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Opening hours, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

128
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,914
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to extend our license to 1 AM.

129
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:10,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We have events that go into a later hour and don't want to have to end them, sports games that go late, that kind of thing.

130
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one was for every day.

131
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:15,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's the sort of thing that like,

132
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Restaurants don't always use it, but, and this was the same for Mrs. Murphy's.

133
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:45,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up approving it as like a blanket thing because they already had, I mean, we approved it sort of at the discretion of the restaurant, but since they already have the license on one hand with the approval, it doesn't, we don't really have, I mean, it's a little tricky to say now,

134
00:21:46,155 --> 00:22:05,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now that we, I mean, in my personal opinion, I don't think it makes sense to say to restrict it because often you're like telling people they should leave in the middle of an event or like, um, like a sports game, you're like halfway through the game.

135
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, where you have to close.

136
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

137
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:22,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I do know that there are, sorry, if I can butt in, I do know that there are residents who are concerned about it, but I, you know, I think there are even more residents who want it open.

138
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:36,946
[SPEAKER_03]: From my past experience, last term, we came up across a few of these books, and a lot of them generated big discourse, and I think it was quite in one direction rather than the other.

139
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:45,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted it to accurately say what days that I'm not whether it should be open or not open.

140
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:49,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in favor, but I just want to reflect what we had actually decided.

141
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:52,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would just propose.

142
00:22:54,005 --> 00:23:00,268
[SPEAKER_03]: for that point, just to say to permit this, to permit the establishment to stay open until 1 a.m.

143
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:08,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That way it's not, because as Councilor Lazaro said, it's not like that, it's not that we're, that they're going to be open until 1 a.m.

144
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: every night, it's like they can.

145
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's probably better, clearer wording.

146
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:23,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we approved your request to amend the commons furthest that permitted

147
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The establishment to stay up until 1 am permits present probably.

148
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:33,686
[SPEAKER_04]: quit correcting my grammar law school boy.

149
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry.

150
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:51,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and while that discussion was happening, I also noticed that there was one item under general business that probably should have been under public health and community safety, the CCOPS.

151
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that I wasn't sure.

152
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:55,626
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we can move that.

153
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

154
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did it in a regular meeting.

155
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't sure where to put it.

156
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:07,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

157
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:09,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always kind of troublesome, because like it.

158
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: They do eventually move to those, right?

159
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't public health.

160
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:33,440
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about it is that the police report started in public health and community safety, but the other portions of it, like the parking department's report, was never in public health and community safety.

161
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That was straight into a committee of the whole.

162
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:46,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some other parts of it that are all the surveillance reporting that was never in public health community safety.

163
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:52,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel like general business is too big and I like to write just for visuals.

164
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:53,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the newsletter.

165
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

166
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,330
[SPEAKER_02]: No, our beautiful newsletter, which I love.

167
00:24:59,050 --> 00:24:59,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

168
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

169
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

170
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:13,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still obviously after like extract YouTube links, but other than that, is anybody, um, okay with what's with what's written here so far?

171
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

172
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,892
[SPEAKER_03]: motion to approve this and publish and circulate it.

173
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:24,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

174
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, Emily, did you second that?

175
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lozaro?

176
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:31,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

177
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:36,217
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of councilor saying to approve, seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

178
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:37,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

179
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is to approve as edited and then publish?

180
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

181
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan?

182
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:50,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

183
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:52,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazaro?

184
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:52,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

185
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:54,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

186
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:55,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Singh?

187
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:56,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

188
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:57,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Lemming?

189
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:58,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

190
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:07,221
[SPEAKER_04]: For approved, one absent, we will publish the May newsletter.

191
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:13,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, we have, let me just get back to my digital copy of the agenda.

192
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolution for a public engagement plan for the FY 26 budget.

193
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:30,364
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically, if you recall at the last meeting, we permitted Councilor Sang to

194
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:50,646
[SPEAKER_04]: keep the budget survey open for a little bit longer, and I just asked him to come up with like a description of the overall trends, asks, so on, that we've seen in the FY26 budget survey so far.

195
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:56,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever you're ready, just kind of tell us what people are saying about, saying in the survey, councilor saying.

196
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't have time this time to make a fancy PowerPoint but I did put things in a Word doc so I figured I'll just share the screen with you guys I will end up reading from it a little bit, but we can move it faster that way.

197
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:11,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

198
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:14,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we got 110 responses which is decent.

199
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:26,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And these responses, I wanted to start with the demographic data just to frame like our sense of what kinds of people are engaging with it.

200
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:40,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we always see that with anything with city government, anything with political participation really, it most reflects the people who are best able to engage with city, you know, with politics.

201
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's important to look at the demographic data first.

202
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So this survey, it's Hughes female.

203
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:57,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get a decent representation from across the city, maybe a little bit less from East Medford.

204
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:12,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But compared to my last version of the survey, this is a bigger, more diverse spread in terms of neighborhood representation in responding to the survey.

205
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:21,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We also see that the survey is disproportionately high income.

206
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:28,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something to keep in mind when we review the results of this survey as well.

207
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:37,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And it very much heavily skews towards homeowners.

208
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:44,569
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the census estimates, the current spread of homeowner versus renter in the city is 53% homeowner, 47% renter.

209
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a very, very big skew.

210
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:56,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And the median age in the city, I believe, is around 35 years old.

211
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:58,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So this very much skews older as well.

212
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's another thing to keep in mind.

213
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:16,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't find any clear numbers of parents, like percentages of parents in the city, according to the census.

214
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just for our, for us to know.

215
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:29,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ended up being around 54% saying that they didn't have kids under the age of 18, 42% saying that they did.

216
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:45,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, very expectedly, excuse white as well, although we did do better with getting Asian American responses than the last time.

217
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually will say, compared to my last survey, there are more people in their 20s answering as well, but it's still, you know, a lot less than the actual proportion in the city.

218
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:00,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very English speaking.

219
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing.

220
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:07,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what the census estimates are, but it very much skews towards English speakers.

221
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:13,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So, with the kind of caveat that we shouldn't treat this as a poll,

222
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: There are kind of common themes that came up in a lot of the responses.

223
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So, depending on how you cut it, schools and education was the most mentioned kind of topic when it came to the short term needs question.

224
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:39,090
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you combine the different kind of infrastructure questions into a bigger infrastructure thing.

225
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you repeat how many responses total we got?

226
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:43,672
110.

227
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

228
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:56,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost half of the responses mentioned schools and education, and almost half mentioned some form of infrastructure DPW street sidewalk as well.

229
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:05,044
[SPEAKER_03]: These numbers aren't, so this is 40, this is saying 46 responses mentioned schools and education.

230
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:18,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not saying that, like, oh, like, it's not, you know, if you add up the number of responses, it's not, it's going to add up to more than one to 10, because some responses mentioned more than one category.

231
00:31:19,217 --> 00:31:24,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, the DPW question really depends on how you cut it.

232
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:31,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I should I actually I should update this, um, this should read, this should read 46.

233
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:42,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So we basically got even number of responses talking about schools and education, and an even number of responses talking about streets and sidewalks.

234
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were the two that really dominated the short term needs section.

235
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came to schools.

236
00:31:51,748 --> 00:32:00,899
[SPEAKER_03]: The focus was on Medford public schools and just getting adequate staffing adequate funding for the schools, but there were a number of residents who brought up after school care as well.

237
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:07,626
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came to streets and sidewalks think the heavy emphasis was on improving

238
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:14,364
[SPEAKER_03]: road conditions, you know, cracked streets and sidewalks, potholes, stuff like that.

239
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:25,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was actually a lot of talk, you know, comments about crosswalk safety, safer pedestrian infrastructure, cycling infrastructure as well.

240
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:28,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are five responses.

241
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:29,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I changed it from 41 to 46.

242
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:34,449
[SPEAKER_03]: There are five responses that talked about DPW funding more generally.

243
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:48,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fair to infer that it's about streets and sidewalks, but they talked about just getting more funding for staffing in the office and better responsiveness there.

244
00:32:49,527 --> 00:33:01,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we saw we had 25 responses mentioned, um, non street infrastructure projects that these are projects that are kind of like public buildings, the high school city hall.

245
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:19,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 21 responses talking about affordable housing and development, particularly asking for more help for renters and kind of more just spending more money on housing as well.

246
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is a very new jump is there 16 responses that explicitly mentioned more support for vulnerable low income immigrant residents, particularly putting it in the frame of what the federal government is doing.

247
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: When I did the survey, two years ago, that was only mentioned by three or four people with a bigger, bigger sample size.

248
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is a really, really big change from two years ago.

249
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:53,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other frequently mentioned priorities, transit, transportation, 14 responses.

250
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:56,978
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of more focused on public transit.

251
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:04,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So safer cycling routes, better bus service, better MBTA access.

252
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:22,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue bike expansion, public safety 13 responses but this one public safety is kind of a big bucket to put this in it's not just about police, and honestly there were responses that cut both ways some asking for more police funding and a pretty much equal amount asking for cuts to police funding.

253
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were also calls.

254
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:30,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of it didn't talk explicitly in the frame of police.

255
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:37,025
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it was about fire, EMS, and just helping vulnerable populations in the city.

256
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:42,470
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 13 responses mentioning funding for the library, asking for full funding.

257
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Four responses about trees, floods, like climate issues.

258
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were five responses about losing federal funding and concerns about patching those holes.

259
00:34:54,741 --> 00:35:01,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I move on to the things that are statistically significant, I see Councilor Lozaro has her hand and I don't know if you want to.

260
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:03,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lozaro, feel free to ask your question.

261
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:21,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought, I just wanted to highlight how interesting it is that our two override issues are the two things that people, I mean, the things that passed in the overrides are the two things that people were most commonly mentioning, the schools and the streets.

262
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even though they passed, there's still like,

263
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have more funding for them.

264
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:36,169
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still something that people think about a lot as something that we are still in need of more attention for.

265
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:39,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to highlight it.

266
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, and that's an excellent point.

267
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:49,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what the majority of Medford we know for sure cares about.

268
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor is saying it said 46 responses for both of them, like for each of those.

269
00:35:55,154 --> 00:36:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have any, I don't know if you noticed off the top of your head, but like, do you have an idea of like how many mentioned either one?

270
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, was it like 60 or 80?

271
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:07,034
[SPEAKER_04]: that mention either schools or roads or both?

272
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:09,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't have that number right now.

273
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:14,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably get it, but yeah.

274
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:14,619
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

275
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,020
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look through it, it is quite a few.

276
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not insignificant.

277
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,843
[SPEAKER_03]: The overlap is not insignificant.

278
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:21,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

279
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,384
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

280
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

281
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's certainly really interesting.

282
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:35,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think speaks to why the overrides were at least seen by a majority of residents in the city is really important.

283
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

284
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:47,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if I can add my own commentary to this, in reading through the responses, I got a sense that a lot of residents saw the override as just

285
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:54,105
[SPEAKER_03]: like one step in the solution rather than the complete answer to the solution.

286
00:36:54,785 --> 00:37:14,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really get the impression that people thought that the overrides would solve everything about school funding or street repair funding, rather that they kind of just saw it as like, okay, this is what we need right now before we kind of either develop a more long-term plan or come back to the voters in the future.

287
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:16,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of like,

288
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,971
[SPEAKER_03]: This came up especially with the schools.

289
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:30,016
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of responses were kind of about, we know that we have good funding this year for the schools, but we need to make sure that we maintain this going forward.

290
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:38,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was kind of, that was a decent like chunk of responses focusing on that.

291
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I also thought it was really interesting to see what was statistically significant.

292
00:37:47,504 --> 00:38:02,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I, this isn't completely unsurprising but young like younger respondents, particularly in the, in their 30s were more likely to highlight housing library, public safety issues, middle aged, like 4040 to 59 year olds were kind of more.

293
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:10,612
[SPEAKER_03]: more emphasizing roads and sidewalks and big capital projects like buildings.

294
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:19,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And then older adults, 60 to 69, that category, more consistently mentioned street repairs and public infrastructure as well.

295
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:33,747
[SPEAKER_03]: So the kind of focus on infrastructure seems to be correlated with older age and the focus on housing and library and some education issues.

296
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:36,729
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to be a little bit more correlated with youth.

297
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's important to keep in mind because we know that this survey skews towards older older voters as well.

298
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:54,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents, unsurprisingly, much more, you know, frequently mentioned afterschool programs, schools, et cetera.

299
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:08,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another kind of important thing to titrate with is income, because we know that this survey is huge towards much, much, towards much, much higher incomes than, you know, our median here in Medford.

300
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:17,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So higher income respondents were more likely to emphasize non-street infrastructure and library services.

301
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:30,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And then mid to lower income respondents were much more likely to bring up affordable housing and support for vulnerable communities as the short-term priority in the city.

302
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:42,609
[SPEAKER_03]: When we go to long term needs, schools and education remains at the top, a little bit fewer responses but still, you know, up there.

303
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:51,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we see the kind of framing change from just getting funding to kind of more long term like big picture.

304
00:39:53,458 --> 00:40:00,486
[SPEAKER_03]: goals for the schools, so stronger leadership, staffing, curriculum equity, afterschool care.

305
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:05,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Housing jumps up when you ask about long-term priorities as well.

306
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:09,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It jumps up to 31 responses, becomes the second most

307
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: frequently mentioned topic.

308
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:19,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of calls for proactive zoning reform.

309
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:26,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So more aggressive zoning reform, funding for the affordable housing trust, and tenant protections.

310
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-street infrastructure.

311
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, again, like buildings.

312
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:35,102
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 responses, which is also quite significant.

313
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:39,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is the water and sewer system as well.

314
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was also like people linked this to climate.

315
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:54,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're asking for, like when it came to the sewer system, there were a few responses that linked it to flooding.

316
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,482
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came to buildings, a lot of people linked it to emissions as well.

317
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:05,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Economic development becomes a lot more mentioned as well.

318
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:25,323
[SPEAKER_03]: there were kind of a few different ways of going about it, but I think residents were really focused on business development, supporting small businesses, supporting kind of the aesthetics of the or improving the aesthetics of the square or of Medford Square and our like smaller squares as well.

319
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:33,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also bringing up the idea of placemaking and community building through like economic development and redesigning our squares.

320
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Climate also becomes much more mentioned.

321
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:46,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, a lot of this is about trees and heat islands, but generally climate becomes a lot more mentioned.

322
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:54,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And then roads and sidewalks, still very frequently mentioned, drops a lot in dimensions, but the difference

323
00:41:55,414 --> 00:42:03,584
[SPEAKER_03]: with the old responses is that these responses focus more on long-term strategy and proactive maintenance rather than just potholes.

324
00:42:03,684 --> 00:42:08,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are more mentions here that kind of talked about complete streets.

325
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:26,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And then statistically significant demographic patterns, younger residents were more likely to mention housing, climate, economic development, older residents were more likely to mention infrastructure and infrastructure in general.

326
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:40,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually didn't see that many statistically significant differences with this question when it came to income like we like in the other, like the short-term priorities question.

327
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:54,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is just so you guys can see things that were raised a lot more under this kind of framing, economic development, climate, housing, that was these three in particular.

328
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:58,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people see these as long-term priorities.

329
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:09,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it came to the question about what new programs and services Medford should fund, there are quite a lot of responses about youth or teen programs.

330
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of it was in the frame of afterschool care.

331
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:22,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it was in the frame of teen centers, job programs, volunteer enrichment opportunities, and mental health.

332
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:24,940
[SPEAKER_03]: the framing of mental health.

333
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:33,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got a lot of mentions of city services, some of them went into more detail, some of the comments went into more detail than others.

334
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:52,425
[SPEAKER_03]: When they went into details I think things that came up were code enforcement, housing inspection, customer service, communication, and focusing on kind of like permitting reforms, internal reforms that we can make due to

335
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: make City Hall more efficient.

336
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:02,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Public transportation and mobility also is frequently mentioned under this as well.

337
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:10,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So public transit, cycling infrastructure, multimodal planning, and then shuttles.

338
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:20,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a transportation task force out there right now working on the shuttle idea as well, because the federal funding is going to change for it.

339
00:44:23,462 --> 00:44:47,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Economic development, people kind of, there's some appetite for us to look into new programs when it comes to incentivizing economic development and SOAR fronts, tackling vacancies, and then also increasing mixed use in our city.

340
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:57,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Housing support as well, housing navigation, stabilization programs, eviction support, homelessness prevention and outreach.

341
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:04,691
[SPEAKER_03]: These were things that residents wanted us to do more and to create more programs about.

342
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:10,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And then new programs related to climate, five people mentioned that.

343
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: very similar to what I mentioned before already.

344
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Infrastructure roads as well, also very similar to what I mentioned before, the only kind of new things coming in here.

345
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:36,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Curb ramps came up, private way improvements, which we know is a really tricky issue, but a lot of, you know, given that I think 36% of our roads are private ways, I know it is a really important issue in the city.

346
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:41,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And then recreation and like funding for

347
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: like more culture and recreation programming through the library.

348
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:48,711
[SPEAKER_03]: There were six responses about that.

349
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:54,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were responses that mentioned mental health programs and equity and access programs.

350
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: This question had a lot fewer responses.

351
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: These were optional questions, but younger residents were a lot more statistically likely to propose new programming.

352
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:28,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some miscellaneous ideas that came up that didn't really fit neatly into any of the categories, participatory budgeting, third spaces, and leveraging our relationships with nonprofits.

353
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:30,818
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a typo.

354
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:31,478
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't there.

355
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:34,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I also integrated that.

356
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came to kind of the last page of the

357
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:57,381
[SPEAKER_03]: The survey participation updates these were the options we we offered and honestly, there was a lot of kind of a lot of responses for all of them besides robo calls and attending listening sessions.

358
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: The most popular responses were the council newsletter and social media posts, but this also skews towards those responses because those were the channels where we were most aggressive about distributing the survey.

359
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the channels that were most open to us.

360
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should kind of keep that in mind when it comes to this.

361
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:27,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this kind of suggests that we should find a holistic approach.

362
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,961
[SPEAKER_03]: to reach our residents.

363
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:39,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this was the second question about more specifically about participating in the budget process.

364
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:46,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people, again, the newsletters, they're very high.

365
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an explanation for that.

366
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:52,216
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's some, you know, people want to be able to email us.

367
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:53,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very

368
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:56,984
[SPEAKER_03]: very common as a response.

369
00:47:57,144 --> 00:48:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is interest in a special budget-related Zoom meeting, listening sessions, and town halls.

370
00:48:09,783 --> 00:48:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it came to the open-ended question about questions and comments about the budget process, I kind of looked at them and then broadly categorized them, although I think it's worth just going through it on our own and reading through what people responded because there aren't that many responses.

371
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:34,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are probably around 30 responses to that question, 30 to 50, somewhere there, maybe 30, 40.

372
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:43,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But broadly, I think there's six buckets.

373
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:48,109
[SPEAKER_03]: People want to know how the budget process is structured and decided.

374
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:56,613
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to know where the money is going and how we track it and how we explain that.

375
00:48:57,754 --> 00:49:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to know how they can, residents want to know how they can participate meaningfully.

376
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:10,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to know who is being included in the process and who is being left out.

377
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanna know why aren't, why does it feel like poor services aren't more functional than they are?

378
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of this is actually perception.

379
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:24,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we can talk about after too.

380
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people wanna know if we are addressing urgent and long-term needs and how we keep track of stuff like that.

381
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:37,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the last page, the last part of it.

382
00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:42,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these questions go to talking about

383
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:49,916
[SPEAKER_03]: like communicating better about things that we already are doing as a city, and especially as a city council.

384
00:49:50,876 --> 00:49:58,240
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what residents raised are covered in the zoning reform, the zoning reform process.

385
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,422
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is in the Medford square revitalization plan of the RFP that that is being proposed.

386
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:12,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think more work has to be done to let residents know about that a lot of their ideas are in there.

387
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:13,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

388
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:25,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a good kind of encapsulation of that point I just made are the comments about permitting and about City Hall being slow.

389
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:34,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a perception is there, but as we heard in our budget meetings, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have talked to our business and planning staff about this,

390
00:50:36,315 --> 00:50:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: and building department staff about this, on the city council side actually, or on the Medford side, the city of Medford side, a lot of that actually happens very quickly.

391
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:50,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get permitting done within a day or two, but a lot of it is at the state level as well.

392
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:58,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The state has its whole litany of regulations and permitting processes as well, and that oftentimes can take up to two years.

393
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a, you know, I think we might need to educate the public more about what is city controlled and what is state controlled, but also do more advocacy on behalf of the city to get the permitting done quicker on the state level.

394
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:19,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's my summary.

395
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:20,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

396
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:22,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very thorough summary.

397
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Much appreciated.

398
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:31,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also glad that it got written down in a document that can be distributed after the meeting.

399
00:51:31,805 --> 00:51:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any questions from councillors?

400
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

401
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:42,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Lazaro.

402
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any questions.

403
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:48,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really appreciate you going through and distilling the data this way.

404
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, qualitative data like this is really hard to, sometimes hard to put into cohesive, like a cohesive narrative this way.

405
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you doing that.

406
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:11,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I think is really interesting was that you figured out that people would be interested in a Zoom meeting that functions as like a listening session around the budget.

407
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:12,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that,

408
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:16,622
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be a useful thing, maybe for a lot of people.

409
00:52:18,404 --> 00:52:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We could potentially do in-person even, but yeah, I mean, I think budgeting is really abstract to people sometimes, and it can be very easy to say, to be as an average resident, to be like a naysayer, to be like, what are they even spending all this money on?

410
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:38,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a huge amount of money, and then,

411
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was so useful, I thought, in one of our meetings when Councilor Callahan pulled up the pie chart, and it's like, this much is going to insurance no matter what, no matter what.

412
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: This much is going to paying off the bonds and the interest on our loans.

413
00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have nothing to do with that, and we can't change it.

414
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So always know that these numbers are immovable.

415
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And this much is what we pay for the schools, and it's huge.

416
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,905
[SPEAKER_02]: there's that, there's fire, there's police.

417
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:20,611
[SPEAKER_02]: These are huge amounts of money and we can't, we don't, we wouldn't want to make those lower because then we really are putting our city at risk.

418
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:27,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So like these things are, but I think these, like those conversations, I think most people, when they heard them, they would be like, oh yeah, absolutely, super reasonable.

419
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:35,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more you have those conversations openly and transparently, the better people understand things on like, this is how you have,

420
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: a transparent government and people being interested in that is really good, I think.

421
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to have that all laid out for us.

422
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So really useful data.

423
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:50,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing it.

424
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:52,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for putting it forward for us.

425
00:53:56,331 --> 00:54:02,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any comments from members of the public, if anybody would like to?

426
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:08,175
[SPEAKER_04]: ask any questions on Zoom, feel free to raise your hand.

427
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:10,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I see two members of the public there.

428
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:14,258
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the more informal committees, so.

429
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, seeing none, just like to, once again, express my appreciation for all the work that you clearly put into this, Councilor Sang.

430
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:30,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also generally, you know, generally happy that the,

431
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:40,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Demographics seems to have gotten like a slightly less biased in terms of its demographics from last year.

432
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:47,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's good that progress is being made on that end of things.

433
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:50,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

434
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:58,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we need a motion to keep the paper in committee or a motion to release the survey report?

435
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:00,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

436
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:12,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we can do a motion to distribute the survey or should we, I guess it makes sense to distribute it to counselors and then counselors can see what they want to do with the data.

437
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:18,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so I guess motion to distribute to counselors.

438
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We could keep the paper in committee.

439
00:55:23,399 --> 00:55:26,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last big thing related to it, but what we could

440
00:55:28,232 --> 00:55:45,427
[SPEAKER_03]: unless we hold a Zoom meeting as a committee, but I think that's a question for counselors, whether we should do it as maybe two counselors do it, or we do a committee listings like Zoom listings.

441
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: We also don't, yeah, yeah.

442
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:57,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could make make more sense to just like counselors do it individually.

443
00:55:57,598 --> 00:56:01,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, as a committee thing.

444
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:10,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think at some point, we do kind of need to like, say, you know, the survey, this the survey at this point is done, let's distribute more of a final report.

445
00:56:10,945 --> 00:56:22,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if we want to follow up on that, like you said, we could just do it on our own initiative doesn't necessarily have to be doesn't necessarily have to be a motion here.

446
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:44,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but I think a motion to distribute the full results of the survey to counselors publicly distribute the report that you just presented and receive in place the paper on file would probably be an appropriate motion.

447
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:45,410
[SPEAKER_03]: and adjourn.

448
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll move that and then I'll add and adjourn.

449
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:51,333
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we still have to review the actual listening sessions themselves.

450
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want a small description from you and Councilor Lozaro.

451
00:56:55,055 --> 00:56:56,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I forgot about that.

452
00:56:57,436 --> 00:56:58,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Slipped my mind.

453
00:56:58,897 --> 00:56:59,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

454
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll move what you just said.

455
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:03,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, great.

456
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:10,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion from Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

457
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:12,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

458
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kellyanne?

459
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

460
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazaro?

461
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:19,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

462
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:22,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

463
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:23,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sands?

464
00:57:23,502 --> 00:57:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

465
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:24,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Lennon?

466
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:25,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

467
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:30,704
[SPEAKER_04]: For affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

468
00:57:30,744 --> 00:57:37,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last, the very last is a update on our listening session.

469
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:38,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand that councilors

470
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:45,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazaro and Sang had a listening session recently at the Senior Center.

471
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:54,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So just an update on how that went, any interesting topics came up, how the vibe was, whichever of you would like to go.

472
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:55,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick vibe check.

473
00:57:57,383 --> 00:57:57,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

474
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:00,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a really productive session.

475
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:01,485
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard from a lot of

476
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:12,153
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of Medfair residents who we tend to get I in my experience they're usually it's it's a listening session.

477
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:15,076
[SPEAKER_02]: it's also kind of constituent services.

478
00:58:15,456 --> 00:58:24,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will have like specific concerns about, you know, things in their neighborhood or on their particular property.

479
00:58:24,322 --> 00:58:33,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I've been following up with some folks and, um, there's still a couple other things I want to circle back on, but, um, yeah, it was very pleasant.

480
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:35,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I always like visiting the senior center.

481
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:36,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice to connect with people.

482
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:37,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

483
00:58:37,632 --> 00:58:38,593
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a really nice time.

484
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:41,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Sang, I don't think has been to one before.

485
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, he can weigh in as well.

486
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:47,478
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think he captured it pretty well.

487
00:58:47,498 --> 00:59:00,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we talked about infrastructure, of course, came up quite a bit, like potholes and traffic came up, like making sure that we are enforcing our speed limits.

488
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that came up.

489
00:59:05,766 --> 00:59:08,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some general conversation about

490
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:21,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The override funds, especially when it came to infrastructure but I think counselor was our pretty much captured it a lot of it a lot of it was constituent service based.

491
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:32,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm just very focused on, you know, like certain things that have come up with residents and and helping us helping link them to the people who can get that solve for them.

492
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:48,741
[SPEAKER_02]: people with people in City Hall who can provide services because, you know, I mean, the thing about City Council is that we are happy to connect people with the services that they can access, but we don't provide really any services.

493
00:59:48,781 --> 00:59:53,466
[SPEAKER_02]: We really just can let people know where they can access services.

494
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a lot of what we do.

495
00:59:55,568 --> 01:00:01,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, some residents did bring up that they find it hard to know how to access the like phone numbers and emails.

496
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:11,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something for for us to think about, especially for residents that don't have computers or don't have ready access to computers.

497
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:12,735
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on my list.

498
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:39,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor Singh had an idea to have a one pager of like frequently referred to phone numbers in city hall, people that you would want to be able to give contact info at listing sessions, you know, a person to call at DPW, a person to call at like maybe housing access, maybe Medford Housing Authority, you know, that kind of thing.

499
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:44,525
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a list of people that you would want to make a phone call to with phone numbers.

500
01:00:46,587 --> 01:00:58,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea, especially for, yeah, I think serving people who don't have computer access quite to the same degree that most do is a

501
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,411
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely a good initiative.

502
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of curiosity was like, I noticed when I went to the listening session that some residents were, it was a little bit like a public meeting almost, and some residents were like afraid to speak up.

503
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:19,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a thing, and I think Councilor Callahan went through this as well, where a few residents would like approach us after and sort of ask questions in private.

504
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the same thing sort of happen or was there more of a, were people more like,

505
01:01:25,145 --> 01:01:33,110
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, willing to, yeah, I see the sunlight, uh, were people more sort of like willing to just like say what was on their mind openly.

506
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:37,092
[SPEAKER_02]: They seemed fairly comfortable at this one.

507
01:01:37,553 --> 01:01:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have a couple of people who always, I mean, there's, there's a couple of people that always get us started, but everybody seems pretty comfortable jumping in.

508
01:01:46,378 --> 01:01:52,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at this, at this particular one, there's always a different energy, but everybody seemed pretty comfortable.

509
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:53,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

510
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,461
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.

511
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you all for the update.

512
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:04,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any other questions from councillors or members of the public?

513
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a motion to keep the paper in committee, or Councillor Callahan?

514
01:02:12,056 --> 01:02:17,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I was, yeah, I was- Oh yeah, motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

515
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:18,102
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

516
01:02:18,122 --> 01:02:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

517
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:23,266
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

518
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

519
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:42,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

520
