1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:04,115
couple minutes to sign on and show up in person.

2
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:05,557
They are coming in person.

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,398
I don't know where Kelsey is.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,560
We're expecting Kelsey here.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,986
I don't see Stacy on here yet though.

6
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:44,093
Is the audio good for folks online?

7
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:47,434
Yep.

8
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:48,354
It's OK.

9
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:52,916
It's a little echoey, Matt, but we can hear you.

10
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:54,257
Good.

11
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,358
And then we are live in our recording.

12
00:00:58,398 --> 00:00:59,058
There's a heads up, too.

13
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:01,619
Thank you, Will.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,303
Then for the recording and for those that may have just joined, we're going to give people another couple of minutes just to hop online or join us in person.

15
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:18,622
floating around the high school for some reason and you want to come up to the science lecture hall, there's a good number of us that are up here.

16
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:22,104
Happy to see you in person, but also happy to have you virtually.

17
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,533
Looks like one might be commuting here too.

18
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:42,821
Thank you.

19
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,785
Matt, I don't know if you're able to see the chat.

20
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:39,308
Aaron messaged, he's stuck in traffic.

21
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:53,059
And then at some point address Norman's question about inviting other stakeholders.

22
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:58,584
That was a good question about the other stakeholders.

23
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,445
I don't know that would have been asked yet.

24
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:18,465
I think if there's other thoughts about other folks that would be great to bring into this advisory team I think you could send it around to myself and the left field team and we'll share it with the school leadership and district leadership and we can definitely take that under advisement and eventually add some folks in.

25
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,249
Thank you for asking the question Norma.

26
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,354
I would just also want to cross-reference the sign up when we put this out to the community.

27
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:29,854
Yep.

28
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:30,435
Yes.

29
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:52,279
And Erin, you should be fine if you're stuck in traffic and listening, completely understood and appreciated that you're still with us remotely.

30
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:01,861
All right.

31
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:06,342
So we are about 4.05, so I'm going to get going.

32
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:13,283
I just want to welcome everybody again to this advisory team meeting.

33
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:18,178
for the new reimagined Medford High School project.

34
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:25,822
This is the second meeting that we're having in this particular series of advisory team meetings.

35
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:34,228
We're going to do just a real quick round of introductions of the team again from the design and OPM side of things.

36
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:41,072
We're not going to go around and do introductions of every Medford community team member at this point in time.

37
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:46,849
because we spent a great amount of time doing that at the first meeting and hopefully everyone got a little bit of an introduction there.

38
00:04:47,670 --> 00:05:04,219
I do, after we get done with this, so I will say that if anyone who is not able to attend the first meeting has joined us just for the second meeting, I will give them just a minute to introduce themselves and their connection to the project as well as their goals and priorities similar to what we did at the first meeting.

39
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,883
So if that is you, if you fall into that category, you can just prepare some thoughts really quickly.

40
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:18,231
After we get done introducing ourselves, feel free to open the floor for that sort of supplementary introduction piece.

41
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,832
So to start things off, again, my name is Matt Bryce.

42
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:26,415
I'm an architect and the principal in charge of the project for SMMA.

43
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,136
And we'll start in the room here.

44
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:44,724
Hi, I'm Rosemary Park from SMMA, and I'm an architect and educational planner who is working on the educational programming, the program spaces for the Revenge at Medford High School.

45
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:46,964
Hi, I'm Sohla Jain.

46
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,265
I'm an architectural designer at SMMA.

47
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:52,025
All right, we have Helen online.

48
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:52,986
Yeah.

49
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:53,766
Hi, everyone.

50
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,327
Helen Fantini, a project manager with SMMA.

51
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:57,707
I'm an architect too, but

52
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,206
I play a project manager on a day-to-day basis, anyway.

53
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,888
All right, and Mike Perrello is not able to be with us this evening.

54
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:13,631
He is our visioning consultant on the educational planning side of things, but then we also have our left-field team here.

55
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,372
Yep, hello, everyone.

56
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,353
Sorry, I couldn't make it in person tonight, but my name's Matt Galino.

57
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,955
I'm the day-to-day project manager for the left-field team.

58
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:28,060
And I am, excuse me, Jen Carlson.

59
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,822
I am the project director with left field as well.

60
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,184
I am Adele Sands.

61
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,167
I'm the education liaison for left field.

62
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,230
Right.

63
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,670
Excellent.

64
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,853
And then this is the team from Medford.

65
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:54,520
And again, if there's anyone here that was not able to speak or attend the last meeting, happy to have

66
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,694
I have a quick amount of time for folks to introduce themselves.

67
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:05,738
You can raise your hand or shout out.

68
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm guessing there's not too many, because I think that we were almost all here the last time around.

69
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,722
So we may not be in the scenario where we have any window.

70
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,103
Absolutely fine.

71
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,564
Great, actually, that everyone was able to attend the first meeting.

72
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:19,925
All right.

73
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,206
I'm going to move forward then.

74
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:31,867
Just a quick recap for those that have been participating in the project, you've seen this slide probably too many times now, and it's all just been completely internalized.

75
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:38,551
But in case anybody is not familiar, again, we are in the feasibility study, the first portion of the feasibility study right now.

76
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:43,935
We are looking to open the school in the fall of 2030.

77
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:48,618
But over the course of this feasibility study and really stretching into schematic design,

78
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:58,601
We will be conducting these advisory team meetings to get some detailed feedback from really experts in the Medford community on particular focus areas.

79
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:05,242
The focus areas are really divided into these four categories.

80
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:12,944
And again, these are not intended to be, they cannot be siloed topics of discussion.

81
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,304
There are overlaps between all of them.

82
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:26,821
But it's important that we have these conversations around these particular topics just to advance the thinking and hear from everyone in the Medford community.

83
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:33,363
And so now we're going to move into the content for this particular meeting.

84
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:45,547
And the way that this is going to be structured for all of our sort of second in the series of meetings is we're going to build off of the topics that everyone provided to us during the first meeting.

85
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,048
We're not just going to sort of run through a list verbatim.

86
00:08:49,108 --> 00:09:03,558
What we've done is gone ahead and categorized and tried to group together topics, thoughts that we heard from everyone at the first discussion so that we can have some additional conversation around each of the group of the topics.

87
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:05,879
We have some visuals to support it.

88
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:08,321
And for each one of the topics that we bring up,

89
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:12,479
We're going to be having a little bit of presentation.

90
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,841
So we have some timeframes that are listed out for each one of the topics that you see here.

91
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:22,623
About half of the time we'll use for presentation on these topics.

92
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:31,947
And then we'd like to have a little bit of conversation, some Q&A, additional thoughts, additional questions that people have on each of these topics as we go through.

93
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:39,242
So we'll try to break up the time half and half between the presentation Q&A so that we're not talking to you guys for an extended amount of time.

94
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:45,108
And we don't have to go back in the slide deck or anywhere just to find particular topics that we're running through.

95
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:49,152
So again, I'll turn this over to Rosemary in a second.

96
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:53,917
But these are the collection of five topics that we're going to run through overall.

97
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,944
Um, and, and then we'll wrap up with some next steps.

98
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:03,648
I'm just talking about what to expect in meeting three, when that comes up and when that is scheduled to be occurring.

99
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,692
Um, so that's, that's the outline of what we're going to be doing today.

100
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:19,159
Um, if there's hands up or anything, as we go through, um, I don't know if Helen or Will, if you guys just want to shout out, because I don't have the ability to see the hands come up, um, quite as easily on my end.

101
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:25,670
So it's helpful if anyone can just help on the moderating side from sort of the remote perspective.

102
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:30,012
Yeah, Matt, I think Jenny, did you have a question or statement?

103
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:40,316
Yeah, Matt, I think you just need to flip your presenter view because what we're seeing is like the presenter view instead of just the slide.

104
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,218
So it's making everything very small out here in Zoom land.

105
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,219
Perfect, thank you.

106
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,300
You got it?

107
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,140
OK, so wait a minute.

108
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:54,089
Yeah, so I got it working for you guys, and then I garbled it up here in the room here.

109
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,150
So give me one second.

110
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,812
I'm going to get out of that.

111
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,374
Thank you, though, for mentioning that, too.

112
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,376
All right, so we're going to go over to you.

113
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,837
I found myself trying to read ahead, so I figured I was not the only one.

114
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,899
And you're back in that same view.

115
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:12,699
Yep.

116
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,601
OK, so now we should be good online, and we should be good here in the room.

117
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,502
No, no, not good online.

118
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,550
Really?

119
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,890
Really?

120
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,831
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,373
I think it's okay to have it in here.

122
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:24,094
There you go.

123
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,895
I think it was just taking a second to change.

124
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,117
Okay, we're good now.

125
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:31,179
Okay, we'll get back, get back there in one second.

126
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,160
Bear with me.

127
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:38,364
It's gonna, it's gonna be not great for a second.

128
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,246
We're gonna swap it over.

129
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,447
Give it a little.

130
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:43,208
Okay, just

131
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:51,906
And let me advance back to where we were.

132
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:54,748
Are you guys good online.

133
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:56,269
Yes.

134
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,310
Okay, excellent.

135
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:05,735
We have Suzanne, who is checking us here and All right.

136
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:07,716
Here we are.

137
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:08,777
Okay.

138
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:09,517
Okay.

139
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:10,978
And so,

140
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:35,494
As Matt said, we had listened to everyone's feedback on the things that they really wanted to see in a new or re-imagined Medford High School and try to understand what this meant for the different priorities and how they were all fitting under similar categories.

141
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:39,358
So the first priority that we saw

142
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:44,011
that we saw was surrounding equity, inclusion, and belonging.

143
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:57,136
And the three main takeaways from that were that equity should be experienced daily through inclusive spaces throughout the school, which will help reduce any type of stigma that may be associated with some of these.

144
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:02,639
And we'll touch on this topic.

145
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,600
You'll see after we go through these how

146
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:11,837
the design or how physical spaces would help support these goals and priorities.

147
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:35,796
We also heard that the integration of special education and EL and other types of student services embedded throughout the learning communities, again, contributing to reducing stigmas attached to that, were going to be a critical point for this school as well.

148
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:46,987
because we really wanted to be able to strengthen the sense of belonging for those students and integrate them fully into the Medford High School community.

149
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:57,735
And then related to this, it was stated that the house model was going to be, was going to play a really important role in

150
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:25,337
providing that sense of community, that sense of belonging, a safe space that would provide not only an area to form and strengthen relationships, but also a space where if a student is in crisis or is having trouble, they immediately know this is where they can go.

151
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,600
And we already know that Becker High School model already

152
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:34,643
has the strong house model that you want to be able to grow a little bit stronger.

153
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:41,732
For topic two, or priority two, was surrounding wellness and well-being.

154
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:52,569
Um, for not just the students, um, but also looking at, um, areas of respite, um, and collaboration for staff as well.

155
00:14:53,189 --> 00:15:00,112
Um, we talked a lot about the need to recharge, um, across all applicants in the building.

156
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:11,836
Uh, for priority three, uh, we looked at the, um, how students can express who they are and find their identity.

157
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,625
find their sense of who they are within the school.

158
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:34,268
And we heard about how the CT programs need, you know, purposeful and right-sized space that will help prepare them for their time beyond Bedford High School.

159
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:40,089
And we also heard about how they could really benefit from being

160
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,051
integrated throughout the school with other types of departments.

161
00:15:47,792 --> 00:16:00,335
We heard how the visual and performing arts should be more visible, that we should be, because right now, as we know, they are tucked away right now in their own wing, in their own corner.

162
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:07,457
So really trying to give those students the ability to show off what they are doing as well.

163
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:09,698
And then just overall,

164
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:15,057
that students should be able to see themselves reflected within the school, within the building.

165
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:30,248
For the fourth priority, looking at a flexible, agile, future-ready school, because we're not just designing for when we open in 2030, but we're looking at 50, 70 years beyond.

166
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,489
So how can this building

167
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:42,755
you know, be prepared to meet the challenges, not just today, but in the future.

168
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:50,561
So, and how can the building support different styles of learning, different types of students?

169
00:16:51,962 --> 00:17:02,049
We heard that the interdisciplinary adjacencies should be able to, that those would be necessary for creating a better learning experience for students.

170
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,673
Collaboration spaces for both students and staff should be easily accessible.

171
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:15,434
You shouldn't have to go all the way down a hallway or walk five minutes to get somewhere.

172
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:20,757
That will promote that type of hands-on collaborative learning that we're looking for.

173
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:26,800
And that the building design should support robust course offerings.

174
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:31,823
We've heard a lot about the different types of courses that want to potentially be offered in the future.

175
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,845
So what can we do with the program

176
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:40,642
in space in order to support those types of future course offerings.

177
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:47,848
And then the fifth priority as identified by this group was about community connection.

178
00:17:48,508 --> 00:18:03,120
And so talking about how the high school should reflect Medford's identity, but also making sure that it's serving the future generations of community and students.

179
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:05,182
And then that

180
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:14,709
All the community spaces should be able to function as active learning environments so that they are being well utilized throughout the day.

181
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,870
So then we'll go over some of those types of spaces.

182
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:33,072
Just before we move on, is there anything that we'd like to add here or just wanna talk about, reflect on?

183
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,254
Can you go back one slide, please?

184
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:37,155
There's a lot of words.

185
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:39,797
There's more pictures coming.

186
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,919
Don't be afraid of this presentation so far.

187
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:51,267
And I'll mention, Kim, as you're looking at it, that we labeled as topics and priorities.

188
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:56,332
The priorities are really the things that we heard coming from the group at the first meeting.

189
00:18:56,712 --> 00:19:02,257
There are some topics that we want to make sure that we cover as part of this initial discussion that maybe didn't come up

190
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:07,118
directly from the group, but just given where we are in the project, we want to talk to as well.

191
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:14,080
So I would say the lion's share, maybe 90% are those priorities, but there's a couple of topics sort of interspersed in through there.

192
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:23,583
And also if what you mentioned individually is not necessarily reflected exactly in one of these categories, we're happy to talk about that a little bit further.

193
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:31,145
What we're trying to do is just organize a conversation around these, but we can branch off as we can to some of the dialogue as we go.

194
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,211
There is also a list of givens coming after this.

195
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:50,955
Did you cover, and I'm sorry I have to step out for a minute, but did you cover at the beginning where this data and information came from so that people are aware of like the input that was involved in how we got to these five buckets?

196
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:56,096
We covered it really quickly, but maybe just to summarize again so everyone is on the same page.

197
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:59,157
So we had our first advisory team meeting for each one of the groups.

198
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:09,071
And what we've done is collected all the feedback, the thoughts that we heard from everybody in terms of their own individuals or connections to the project and priorities and goals.

199
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:17,056
And we've tried to categorize them, summarize them through these topics so that we can sort of organize the conversation around that.

200
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:24,401
So there definitely is some interpretation and analysis and collecting of thoughts that has happened here.

201
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,085
And we're happy, again, to sort of modify this further as they go.

202
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:32,647
This is really just an organizational framework for the conversation today.

203
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:42,252
I just wanted to elevate then that on that number two, wellness and well-being, bullet A, that talks about spaces for students to decompress.

204
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,253
I know we've talked about that a couple of times.

205
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:48,716
Like I've said this a lot, I want to make sure that that's appropriate to a high school setting.

206
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:52,478
We talked about needing to make sure the building is safe without synchronies that could

207
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,082
provide an unsafe situation for students.

208
00:20:55,442 --> 00:21:04,026
So I don't know that a non-education person would read that bullet and think what I just said out loud, so I just want to be really clear.

209
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:17,713
So and we'll, going into the next meeting, we're jumping ahead a little bit in terms of what's coming, but we'll actually be coming up with sort of more of an itemized list of exact sort of recommendations to be including going forward.

210
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:22,876
So I think, Kim, something like that, which is a great example, actually, for everybody to sort of be thinking about as we're going through there,

211
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:33,149
So if there's things specific line items that we want to make sure are captured, we'll be able to reflect those in sort of the next version of things that come out of this meeting and eventually go to the building committee.

212
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:40,411
All right.

213
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:47,653
So for those that have been in our programming meetings, we've seen this list a lot.

214
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,494
I know that Chad and Marta have seen this over and over and over again.

215
00:21:52,142 --> 00:22:10,613
What we wanted to just let everyone know is that whether, we don't know yet if this is going to be, you know, what scope of addition renovation or new building the project will be, but regardless, the building will have this list of givens that are on this slide.

216
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:17,718
So when we talk about things like air conditioning and we don't want, can we not have the noisy

217
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,785
ventilated, the ventilating systems.

218
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,347
Can we have more, more outlets?

219
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:32,373
You know, reliable, reliable Wi-Fi, better technology, all of these things, those are all part of the project.

220
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:33,153
They are givens.

221
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,796
That's a baseline for, for the project, regardless.

222
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:40,818
Good acoustics, all of those things as well.

223
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,422
So we just wanted to make sure that this was covered in case someone thinks that these are not priorities.

224
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:47,263
They are

225
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,080
they're just already given.

226
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,581
Can I ask a question about a given?

227
00:22:53,442 --> 00:23:03,186
Is it a given at this point that teachers will no longer have individual classrooms and that classrooms will be shared spaces?

228
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:10,350
Because I was sort of under the impression that is a given, but it doesn't kind of show up often in these conversations.

229
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,031
So I just want to make sure that that's out there.

230
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:16,813
And as we're thinking about some of the other topics, whether it's collaboration or not,

231
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:24,460
knowing that there's not individual teacher assigned classrooms influences how we might think about other spaces.

232
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,961
Yeah, thank you for asking questions.

233
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,343
So yes, it is a given.

234
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:41,410
It is a requirement of the MSBA process when you participate in grant funding through them that there's a shared classroom model at the high school level.

235
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:45,474
that is assumed in terms of overall facility efficiency.

236
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:46,855
That's really what they're trying to get at.

237
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:52,638
So we're trying to get optimal use of the investment for the taxpayers over the course of a day.

238
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,019
That's really what's behind it.

239
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,661
It's not that they're inherently against teachers having their own work, but just trying to maximize the investment.

240
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:10,408
So there are things that we've talked about and things that we'll talk about probably a part of this discussion that are helped to make that a little less challenging in terms of the implementation, in terms of

241
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:19,917
sizes of classrooms, in terms of shared teacher planning resources, in terms of actual space, providing that in very purposeful ways.

242
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:34,812
And then we can also talk about what that looks like in terms of a teacher's perspective, in terms of how many spaces you might be in over the course of a day, which will vary a little bit per discipline or department, in terms of the types of spaces

243
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:50,077
that.

244
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:50,597
Is.

245
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:59,660
Your classroom model is about what you spoke about about use and efficiency so that there is a calculation around.

246
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,821
That classrooms there.

247
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,702
You should be like something like.

248
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:05,922
85% right?

249
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:08,443
Yeah, so I think that.

250
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:11,084
That's part of the calculation.

251
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:14,845
I just wanted to be clear that it's not just this broad.

252
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:19,247
General everyone has to share their classrooms.

253
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:19,727
There's like

254
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:33,592
that goes into making sure that we are not creating spaces that kind of go unused for more than 85 or less than 85% of the time.

255
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:45,536
And I think we in going and touring other schools have had a really nice opportunity to be able to engage in conversation with a lot of educators that are doing that.

256
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,978
And I know that a lot of the conversations in other districts are around

257
00:25:52,053 --> 00:26:04,458
One district in particular made it so that teachers were in more than two spaces within a given time, so that they know that their core classes were all in this space.

258
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:13,062
So that when you're talking about materials that you need, anchor charts for kids, and things like that, it's in one space.

259
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:18,624
And you're able to collaborate with that person, but you're in a different role.

260
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:29,721
maybe for core teachers, electives or things like that may be in a different space because you have to look at how the schedule goes and what the availability is.

261
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,864
I think it's a great way to frame it.

262
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:45,513
And I'd like to add that on top of what the MSBA formula is, we do our own analysis on the curriculum, on the schedule to see if that number will differ from the MSBAs.

263
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,494
Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.

264
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:48,235
Which one?

265
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:51,185
I'm sorry, what number are you referring to?

266
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:52,586
The number of classrooms.

267
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:54,417
I think we lost your audio in the room.

268
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:26,066
computer microphone.

269
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:29,107
It's probably not going to be great quality.

270
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,329
Or let me try one other thing.

271
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:33,690
If I hit the button on the owl again.

272
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,491
Yeah, it's red right now, so.

273
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,173
Matt, we can hear you by the way.

274
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:40,694
Yeah, actually more clearly through your computer.

275
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:45,757
Well, that'll work for me, but I'm not sure it'll work for you.

276
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:47,658
Let me change back to the owl.

277
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:52,401
It seemed like it just needed like a little button press to get it working again.

278
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,243
Um, all right.

279
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:58,604
Can you guys still hear me?

280
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:00,465
Yes, we can.

281
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:05,268
Okay, so I think we just know now what's going to happen if the owl goes to sleep for whatever reason.

282
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:08,029
I just run over there and I press the buttons and then it'll come back.

283
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,971
Do you want to sit on that side?

284
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,292
I can jump up and do that.

285
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,273
I want to turn red, it's 8.

286
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:18,275
Okay, um, so thank you for bearing with us, everybody.

287
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:22,758
This is our first remote hybrid meeting, so we're working through that.

288
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,521
Did we miss much of that conversation?

289
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:30,244
How much of the shared classroom conversation did you guys hear?

290
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:34,407
I felt like we heard the majority of it.

291
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:34,867
OK.

292
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,691
You heard Suzanne's explanation towards the end as well?

293
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:41,051
Yes.

294
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,292
Yes.

295
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:43,152
And Roseanne.

296
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:45,013
Rosemary, not Roseanne.

297
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:45,614
Rosemary.

298
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:47,035
All right.

299
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:48,255
I was worried if it's Roseanne.

300
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,076
I don't know who that is.

301
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:49,536
Yeah, I know.

302
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:54,756
I don't know who it is either, so I don't know where it came from.

303
00:29:55,796 --> 00:30:00,277
Matt, I had a question on the priority slide, if this is an appropriate time to ask.

304
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:03,117
Yep, we can back.

305
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:06,518
We're going to get into each of the priorities as we run through it.

306
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:09,778
So does it make more sense to just wait till we get to that section?

307
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:10,719
Absolutely.

308
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:18,300
All right, so I'm going to let Rosemary just give a quick primer here, and then we can just jump into the discussion.

309
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:43,695
So we've talked a lot about, you know, we've heard that we're trying to really make this school as equitable and inclusive as possible in trying to remove stigmas associated with special education or being an EL student, or we're calling it ML.

310
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,256
We'll say it like that.

311
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:45,576
And so,

312
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:55,170
We were thinking about how to best illustrate how the architecture and how design can actually support this.

313
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,411
How can the building support this?

314
00:30:56,932 --> 00:31:16,346
And so in looking at it, really wanting to zoom into how a learning community or a classroom pod can help support this idea of community, of integration, of welcoming and of belonging.

315
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:17,307
And so

316
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:32,587
You can see up on the screen, typically, you know, if you're looking at a very traditional old model of a high school, you used to have the very siloed departments.

317
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:40,170
And so science right now, currently in your building is like one of those, where you've got, you know, all science, just in one, in one location.

318
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:46,793
In an integrated learning community,

319
00:31:47,317 --> 00:32:09,148
You could have special education, self-contained special education programs, resource rooms, core academics, EL, science, CTE within the same learning community to really help make it feel like one cohesive community.

320
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,971
We've got administration, a house office,

321
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:19,063
also embedded within this learning community as well to provide that support.

322
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:33,668
Within this floor plan as well, we've got small group rooms, breakout spaces that help support the sort of pullout for special services that are required for special education.

323
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:42,251
Students don't need to go to another far end of a building in order, you know, there used to be a special education, right?

324
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:43,632
And so

325
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:54,514
students can receive their services within their learning community without having them feel different or isolated or separate.

326
00:32:55,674 --> 00:33:13,266
And of course, this is one example, just one example of how it can be done, but there are ways of using adjacencies programs in order to help create a cohesive community in which everyone feels welcome and like they do belong.

327
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:26,069
Now, of course, this is something that we would work closely with you and the school to understand what those adjacencies want to be.

328
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:43,352
We don't want to just randomly throw things together, but really take a deep understanding as to what are some of these relationships that can be formed here to have everyone feel like they are under this umbrella of Medford High School

329
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:49,595
Just to quickly clarify, so this is an example floor plan.

330
00:33:49,635 --> 00:34:04,258
And if people are not familiar with reading floor plans, the lighter yellow spaces here are illustrating corridors or hallway spaces that run through the more vibrant yellow or stairs that run up and down.

331
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:05,918
So there's other levels here.

332
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:09,419
This is an example from our Waltham High School project.

333
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:15,080
To just give you an idea, this is actually a STEM wing in terms of the overall organization.

334
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,577
But just in case people are wondering sort of what we're looking at.

335
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:22,442
This is not necessarily like a design suggestion for Medford High School yet.

336
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,625
We're definitely not there yet in the process.

337
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:34,717
The overall design process is really just an example for people to see in terms of how we might bring together different spaces to achieve the goals that Rosemary was

338
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:49,328
with that as well.

339
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:54,210
EL is considered a core academic room.

340
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,630
It's not special education.

341
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:08,955
And so the idea is that an EL class or a PIMS is more infrastructure so that they really can't go anywhere and lose as needed.

342
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,495
I think we're missing a bit again.

343
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:25,458
I think the owl is coming in and out.

344
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:34,545
I would just use your computer because we in here can hear you speaking and we have to hear you at all.

345
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:42,052
And then when we talk about access, you can see.

346
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:45,595
All right.

347
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:46,656
Can you guys hear us again?

348
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:48,748
Yes.

349
00:35:48,828 --> 00:35:49,108
Yes.

350
00:35:53,090 --> 00:36:12,581
And when we talk about access, student access to counseling or other types of support, we're showing here on the plan in that kind of light tan color, a peachy color, administrative offices, but then that

351
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:21,170
darker maroon purple within the center of the plan or the center of the wing shows teacher planning spaces.

352
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:40,218
So students, and ideally these are in locations that are consistent throughout so students know where to go, where to find that support, but also just making it so that staff and administration, they're readily available and easily accessible.

353
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:46,613
Thoughts, questions about this type of diagram?

354
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,734
Is it clear sort of what is being depicted?

355
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:55,336
Toilets.

356
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:09,137
We have a lot of slides about toilets too.

357
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:14,539
But I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on some of these.

358
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:23,624
If there are any questions also on the way that spaces can be organized.

359
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:28,567
There's a single CTE shop in here.

360
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:36,042
Can you talk about more why it would be done that way and the thinking behind that, having an isolated CTV shop?

361
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,503
Want me to take that one?

362
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,124
Go ahead, Chad.

363
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:46,046
In a situation like this, if we're talking STEM, I would think- We're having a really hard time hearing you guys in the room.

364
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:51,748
So I think we need you to speak loudly or more loudly than you are right now.

365
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,490
Like we can hear you, but very faintly.

366
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,911
And also, if you could,

367
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:23,888
because we can't see you um it would be great if you yeah i think so everyone's gonna have to sort of unfortunately like yell use your teacher voice when you're in the room in order for folks um online to hear because right now the audio is coming through the microphone on my laptop because that's unfortunately what the owl is going to allow us to do the consensus is that you may keep getting booted off the owl because you're

368
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,459
Not on the staff Wi-Fi, you're on the guest Wi-Fi.

369
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,860
I am actually on the staff Wi-Fi.

370
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,801
I have no idea why it's happening.

371
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:32,222
OK.

372
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:34,443
Matt, is that a mic that can help?

373
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,964
It was, but the owl's not on this mic.

374
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:41,026
Oh, I was wondering, can you plug that into your computer?

375
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:46,528
And just to help us who are listening but can't see you.

376
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:50,430
Wait a minute, I have something.

377
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,851
One second, Matt has a backup plan.

378
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,723
Well, I think also, again, this is not

379
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:15,509
this is not depicting anything that is representing your school, because this is from another program.

380
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:30,141
But I think the way that we've been looking at this and in speaking with you, Chad, is, as you were saying, clusters, are there these various clusters of CTE programs that, you know, for an

381
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:43,383
we're thinking like biotechnology, health assisting, dental assisting, you know, could these be programs that could be related to a STEM link?

382
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:54,373
So that there is still that CT identity, but you're still within a learning community with departments and other programs.

383
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:01,084
All right, we're just gonna do one.

384
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:02,865
Matt, can I ask another favor?

385
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:06,406
Because we're just looking at a screen, we can't see any of you.

386
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:10,968
It would be very helpful if people speaking identified themselves.

387
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:13,429
Okay, that's good.

388
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:17,851
It starts being a kind of a blur of who's speaking from what team.

389
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,912
Sure, how is the audio?

390
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:23,533
Is that better though in terms of volume?

391
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,074
It's excellent for us.

392
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,875
Yeah, agreed.

393
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:27,515
It's good here too.

394
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:32,317
OK.

395
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:34,138
All right.

396
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,300
We're still figuring it out.

397
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,240
Hopefully we're there.

398
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:42,704
All right.

399
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:48,427
Sorry, there was some dialogue in terms of where we were.

400
00:40:48,627 --> 00:41:00,535
OK, so I might want to try and push us along just to the next topic, unless there's anything that's really burning on this one that folks want to talk about, because there's a much more exciting slide coming up

401
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:02,709
which is toilet rooms.

402
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:21,517
Alright, so just really quickly in terms of the larger topic of equity inclusion, toilet rooms are something that actually play into this fairly heavily from a school design perspective.

403
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,318
And before we get to that, though, there's

404
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:29,814
a lot of other issues associated with toilet rooms here at Medford High School, right?

405
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,455
We have heard this time and time again.

406
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,816
We've heard it from students, we've heard it from staff.

407
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,597
It's a pain point in terms of the overall experience here.

408
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:41,918
On the left-hand side is one of the existing toilet rooms.

409
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:45,639
I think this might even be one that's in the science wing.

410
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:51,081
So this is probably one of the nicer toilet rooms, student toilet rooms that exist throughout the building, right?

411
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,162
On the right-hand side, as we were touring through some of

412
00:41:55,202 --> 00:42:10,392
newly built recent high schools, we saw the image on the right, which was an open airport entry toilet room, student toilet room, that the school had devised a way to lock off the students, even though it had no doors on it, which is using this sort of foldable gate that they had put up.

413
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:16,517
And like neither of these is what we want to end up with as a solution when we open the new school, right?

414
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:20,299
We want to find something in a design approach that works,

415
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:26,512
means that there have to be some probably change expectations in terms of staff.

416
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:30,455
There needs to be some change behavior in terms of how students interact with them.

417
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:33,818
And it needs to be a collective decision about how we go forward.

418
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:35,299
I know that there's been conversations.

419
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:43,046
We've heard there've been conversations before in terms of how things have moved forward, but we're not going to solve that here today.

420
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:48,030
We're just going to let everyone know that this is definitely something that we're focusing on as we move forward.

421
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:57,135
And we're going to look at it not just through sort of user experience lens, but we're also going to look through the lens of equity as well.

422
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:10,920
And so that means thinking about whether or not we're going to be designing toilet rooms that are based on sort of traditional gender designations, or whether or not we're going to expand that and think about an all gender model, which is less

423
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,321
sort of specific about sort of what toilet facilities someone might use if they're going in.

424
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:22,682
And it's more specifically around sort of a multi-user toilet room model.

425
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:30,803
As we move forward, the plumbing code recently changed in Massachusetts to allow a more inclusive model to at least be considered.

426
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:39,245
And we're not saying yet that that's where we're gonna be going, but we are saying that we need to have the discussion as we go forward, that is in terms of behavior,

427
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:46,910
and in terms of operations, we at least need to think about this and talk about this to understand what is the right model moving forward.

428
00:43:47,450 --> 00:44:05,537
This is, again, an image from, an earlier image from our Waltham High School project, which was not designed as an all-gender, but as an all-gender ready set of toilet rooms so that they are set up with men's and women's sides right now, but they're also able to be converted

429
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:15,652
by removing a section of wall that you can see here on the right hand side so that in the future they can remove the gendered signage out front.

430
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:18,234
They can remove that wall and become sort of free circulation.

431
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:23,459
There are no urinals in terms of these private stalls that are established.

432
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,245
They're all toilets and so they will allow for that all gender model moving forward if that's desired.

433
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:35,697
There are some more even inclusive models out there.

434
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:38,638
There's not a lot at the high school level, but we're going to start seeing that.

435
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:43,541
I think these conversations happening in at least the state of Massachusetts.

436
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:53,506
This is actually an image from RISD down in Rhode Island of a much more integrated model where it was designed to be all gender right up front.

437
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:59,349
So there are private stalls surrounding a shared laboratory model.

438
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:12,122
As we get forward in the discussion, the conversation, we can certainly point out some local locations that people can visit as part of the process to understand how they work and sort of what some of the concerns are there.

439
00:45:13,162 --> 00:45:27,515
But vape detection, fire protection, dedicated exhaust, dedicated lighting, all these things come along with those dedicated sort of all gender but private toilet stalls.

440
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,893
And then just lastly, a quick note to signage as we move forward.

441
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:49,304
This gets a lot more thought, I think, as we go through the process, but as we move forward, the signage will be less about sort of which gender is potentially using the room and really about what the purpose of the room is.

442
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:57,050
And that helps for it to be something that's less differentiating and less othering for any individual

443
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:00,339
is sort of walking up and using a particular room.

444
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:05,001
It's not like you're disclosing your gender identity as you're just doing that most basic of functions.

445
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:25,088
And just a little context is that what we hear often, especially from students from counseling departments also, is that when, if a school says, well, we can just identify this single user room as all gender, the question pops up,

446
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:38,452
you know, is a student outing themselves by just using that, by just heading to that, that instead of going to a multi-user, all gender facility.

447
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:48,200
And that's, it's typically with the students that have that, that have that fear or have that experience.

448
00:46:50,302 --> 00:46:52,443
Sorry, I'm Jack Aberdee from Somerville.

449
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:54,865
My kids go to Medford.

450
00:46:56,645 --> 00:47:05,349
Everybody uses the single stall, not just non-gender conforming, so it doesn't seem to be an issue there.

451
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,931
They're interspersed throughout all the bathrooms.

452
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,734
There's the single stall you can use, and then there's the open.

453
00:47:13,794 --> 00:47:16,035
In our space, next to the full circle, we only have single.

454
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:18,816
It works really well, especially the vape detectors.

455
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:24,169
Jack, can you just describe a little about what Nixville Full Circle is?

456
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:26,950
Because I think everybody online in here may not be aware.

457
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,591
Yeah, it's just that they're- And Jack, we can't hear you, so we need you to get closer to the microphone.

458
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,713
I'm not trying to say a lot, but... Oh, no.

459
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,775
I was just saying that people don't... Is it your mic?

460
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:44,135
It's right there, yeah.

461
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:50,217
People don't seem to... Everybody uses the single stalls if it's open and

462
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:55,605
It doesn't seem to be like a place where only people that are worried about being gendered go.

463
00:47:55,825 --> 00:48:00,608
And then next wave full circle is the therapeutic alternative school within Somerville.

464
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,669
It's middle and high school.

465
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:05,111
And we have all single stall bathrooms that works out really well.

466
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:08,694
The only thing I would say is you need some way to get in.

467
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:17,459
If a student locks himself in there, with SI these days, it needs to be like a quick access point.

468
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:19,741
And sometimes the door locks have not been.

469
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:37,191
If any other quick thoughts, I think our technology has thrown off my timing a little bit, so I don't want to push us along because I think it's an important topic, but I'm just curious if anyone else has any thoughts either online or here in the room.

470
00:48:37,972 --> 00:48:38,492
Toilet rooms.

471
00:48:38,512 --> 00:48:41,134
Again, a lot more to come on this, but.

472
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:47,238
OK.

473
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:51,461
OK, so when we talk about the priority for wellness and well being,

474
00:48:54,245 --> 00:49:15,617
we've talked extensively actually, just throughout this process about, you know, having calming spaces for students, but also spaces where they can take a moment, where they can be, where they can interact with their fellow peers, and then just be able to rejoin as needed.

475
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:24,042
Also, if they're needing to just, as Kim, you had said,

476
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:32,584
you know, making sure that we're creating these spaces that are not just, you know, tucked away in a corner where there's no visibility, no staff oversight.

477
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:36,585
So being intentional with the placement site lines.

478
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:43,427
But there are definitely many different ways to be able to support this.

479
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:51,309
So you can have even just creating small breakout areas along a hallway can

480
00:49:52,579 --> 00:50:05,709
give the student the opportunity to just sit there and, you know, just even take five minutes to just remove themselves from a stressful situation, whether they are by themselves or with a staff person, they can just pull right over into the space.

481
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:15,597
The top right image is an image of a small group room nestled between two classrooms.

482
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:19,780
So and there's access from these classrooms into that space.

483
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:20,741
And

484
00:50:22,635 --> 00:50:35,924
that allows for a student to, and you can see it's being used for just some services, but that can also be space when it's unoccupied for a student to go in, take a moment, and then rejoin their classroom as needed.

485
00:50:36,645 --> 00:50:42,009
Teacher has oversight, has direct sightlines into that space.

486
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:49,314
And then another one I'd like to point out, and the next slide has some more, but just

487
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:52,862
Opportunities, this doesn't have to just be inside the building.

488
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:57,143
We can also provide these types of spaces and opportunities outside as well.

489
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:06,227
And so you can see there's this rooftop, this outdoor courtyard, elevated courtyard on the lower right.

490
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,107
If you go to the next slide.

491
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:19,451
So the outdoors also provides lots of opportunities for these, whether it's to just physically

492
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:41,044
move and get that energy out, or to be able to take a little stroll through a sensory garden with different things that can either tactile or auditory, like maybe some water features or something.

493
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:49,969
But again, giving those opportunities for students and staff to be able to just reset during a stressful time.

494
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:53,835
Next slide.

495
00:51:56,057 --> 00:52:05,045
And so also talking about again how staff need these dedicated spaces also because it's it is a school.

496
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:12,171
It's a place of learning place of education, but it is also a workplace for many people in this building and so.

497
00:52:12,852 --> 00:52:17,856
Meeting areas for recharging like this.

498
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:30,929
lounge, staff dining area, but then also having a teacher planning space where you can collaborate with teachers, do some head down work.

499
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:45,251
Collaboration can happen anywhere, but we understand the importance of being able to provide both head down spaces and collaborative spaces for staff also.

500
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:48,732
Any comments on any of that?

501
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:55,665
Anything you'd like to see more of or less of?

502
00:52:55,985 --> 00:52:57,346
I'd be curious to learn more.

503
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:59,047
Lisa, do you want to just speak up?

504
00:52:59,287 --> 00:52:59,447
Sorry.

505
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:01,368
Should I just talk wildly?

506
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:03,929
Or just identify yourself also.

507
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,430
I'm Lisa Miller.

508
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:11,213
I would love to know more about how other buildings you have gone to shared classroom spaces have

509
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,974
utilize these staff spaces, what's work, what's not, learn from research, I guess.

510
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:27,242
I feel like this is a very new model for our school, and I would like to learn more about, like, sometimes things can sound like a good idea, but in practice, they don't play out the same way as we anticipate.

511
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:33,066
And I would love to learn more about what other schools have learned about these shared spaces.

512
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:39,431
I would find these very hard, like seeing these two, very hard spaces for me to do my prep work, grading,

513
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:43,659
they're a little too communal for some of my heads down work.

514
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,621
So kind of understanding how those spaces better would be helpful.

515
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:55,165
Yeah, I think it's a great point that there's a wide variety of staff, teachers, administrators that are here in this building, right?

516
00:53:55,225 --> 00:54:03,610
And so staff member on the CTE side of things and chapters and core program may have a lot of sort of different needs in terms of that type of space.

517
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,731
And there's also sort of different resources, right?

518
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:09,873
There's typically going to be dedicated office space that's associated with

519
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:12,748
Chapter 74 programs associated with the space.

520
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:16,889
So I think it's definitely something that we can talk about as we move forward.

521
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:34,612
But sort of the concept of lessons learned and sort of learning from some of the recently built examples, we saw some of them as we toured different schools, but any more on the left, I think was the Bill Ricka School that we walked through and some familiar faces for everyone up there.

522
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:38,433
And we heard a couple of sort of pros and cons as we were walking through there.

523
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:48,028
chatting with any staff member that was willing to talk to us, but I think we can be a little bit more sort of direct and purposeful about trying to gather that feedback and that input.

524
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:49,388
Can I elevate two others?

525
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,449
One would be Waltham.

526
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:54,850
This build was what, six years ago?

527
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,151
The Bill Ricker, yeah.

528
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:08,293
Waltham, their shared space was there was like a dining area or a communal area, but there were a lot of more private areas

529
00:55:08,795 --> 00:55:11,076
some that were actually like completely blocked off.

530
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:18,040
I know some schools have almost like that telephone booth where you can kind of like go in and be quiet, make a phone call.

531
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,522
So I think we can definitely be flexible about that.

532
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:38,011
In our visioning sessions, one of them that we had last week, there was a teacher who also elevated, his wife is also an educator, and in the district that she works in, they had some conversations about how

533
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,681
to assign these spaces.

534
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:49,207
So they found it helpful to be assigned by department or role so that it really enhanced the collaboration.

535
00:55:49,247 --> 00:56:03,296
So I think all of those types of conversations, we will be engaging in to see what will best fit our needs and whatever layout we decide on for the instructional aspect of the school.

536
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:12,416
Anybody online with any thoughts on this topic and priority?

537
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:32,946
So for student identity and expression, we wanted to, we talked, people have brought up some things about how the CT programs, CT shops are going to require some, you know, intentional specialized spaces.

538
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:35,868
And so we're not going to show examples for,

539
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:48,865
all of your CTE programs right now, but we're going to show just two that I think illustrate exactly what we mean when we talk about this identity and this expression.

540
00:56:49,485 --> 00:57:01,149
We know that the CTE students are often the ones that have a very strong identity on who they are and what their purpose is.

541
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,591
And so these are some images from a cosmetology

542
00:57:06,585 --> 00:57:16,208
program from cosmetology shop where it looks like a real salon where they have the, you know, and they have the manicure stations here.

543
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:28,431
They've got the salon, the hair areas with that's all set up to take the community in.

544
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:31,031
And so it's community facing.

545
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:33,692
It's really about making it feel

546
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,172
like they are in a professional work setting.

547
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:41,615
Do you want to move to the next slide?

548
00:57:42,075 --> 00:58:02,488
And then another example with health assisting where we're setting it up so that the students are working with the equipment or mock equipment, like mock headwalls, so that they are getting that real

549
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:21,744
the real training that the curriculum calls for, and making sure that when they go off into their co-ops, that they are fully prepared with the types of technology and equipment that they will be working with in the real world.

550
00:58:23,444 --> 00:58:26,826
Chad, I don't know if you wanted to add anything with any of this.

551
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:32,908
That's awesome, because I remember how impressed I was with the simulation table.

552
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:44,532
And how they really, it was the first school I'd ever seen that had truly mimicked a ward of a hospital, complete with a nurse's station out front and adjacent related classroom.

553
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,134
So super impressed with that program.

554
00:58:47,394 --> 00:58:50,856
And I think that's like similar to what we're gonna see when we open dental.

555
00:58:51,056 --> 00:58:59,322
It's gonna very much simulate that environment because of it being a new building and just this opportunity we're getting.

556
00:58:59,342 --> 00:59:03,285
So I think Waltham is a good representation of what I would like to see.

557
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:20,724
I think it's also important to note that there's pockets of this type of sort of vibrancy that the CT programs here have already put up in and around their own shops, either to sort of create a public facing window to the rest of the school or within the shops themselves.

558
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:31,850
And I think what we're going to be doing as we move forward is really trying to find ways to amplify that and sort of bring this type of mentality so that every program really has that ability to like really announce itself

559
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:36,603
and to create sort of that type of really engaging environment throughout.

560
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:42,026
And I think that the spoiler is that it's not just limited to CTE programs here, right?

561
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:48,208
I think these are some examples, but like the next set of slides as we move forward, spoiler, yeah.

562
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:50,810
It's gonna extend really to all programs.

563
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,911
This is something that we've heard through the visioning, right?

564
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:57,613
That there's such a pride that the CTE students here have in their spaces.

565
00:59:58,213 --> 01:00:01,835
And I think that's probably a commonality for a lot of Chapter 74 programs.

566
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:19,674
across multiple schools, but we want to make sure that every student has that ability to have the pride in whatever their passion is here at the high school, whatever they've chosen to do, so that connection is made in a visual way and it's really made in a tangible way so that you feel like you're connected when you're in this space.

567
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:26,816
Right, and so in this image you've got on the left an art room.

568
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,577
It's a digital art room, but by

569
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:46,909
by being intentional about where they're located so they're not far off in their own wing, but then also providing the opportunities to be able to create the visibility from the corridor so that you are creating that kind of exposure.

570
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:58,511
And this is a strategy that we've talked about also using with CTE and other types of programs so that we're aware of what's happening throughout the school.

571
01:00:59,152 --> 01:00:59,992
And you're able to,

572
01:01:01,506 --> 01:01:15,009
a student who maybe never realized that that art program existed, walks by, sees the amazing things that are being done, and then decides maybe next semester I'll take one of those courses.

573
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:19,930
Vice versa, a student going through, like right now, you really are segregated.

574
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:28,632
A student on a pure academic track wouldn't go down the hallway, one or two.

575
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:29,992
So, it's really about, again,

576
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:43,415
creating the opportunities to be able to come together and get to know one another and form those relationships and become this comprehensive Medford High School.

577
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:54,862
And so we're also showing, because we wanted to highlight the fact that we're gonna be designing a 1,000 seat auditorium.

578
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:56,283
And so,

579
01:01:57,053 --> 01:02:00,875
This will tie a little bit into some of the community connections also.

580
01:02:01,536 --> 01:02:10,381
But how can we be intentional about where the performing arts also get located?

581
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:18,006
And how are we showcasing those spaces as well?

582
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:25,270
And then looking at, this is also part of the performing arts,

583
01:02:26,804 --> 01:02:47,753
Looking at a smaller performance space, a black box that can be used for not just performance and showcasing of their own dramatic work, but can also be utilized by other parts of the school as a large group instructional space.

584
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:55,456
But you can see in the image on the left, a black box doesn't necessarily have to be completely closed off.

585
01:02:56,129 --> 01:03:07,837
But maybe there are also opportunities to be able to locate that in an area that is not just tucked away, but again, showing off what your students are doing.

586
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:23,128
And also, I think something about the school store, which we know is also related, the Mustang Mall is related with

587
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:46,992
your business marketing, but just the sense of the student pride and student identity, trying to make that front and center, really trying to showcase that level of Mustang pride, making it central.

588
01:03:47,493 --> 01:03:52,254
In some schools, the school store is right next to the main entrance.

589
01:03:53,191 --> 01:04:00,435
Um, and so how can we make that more visible and, um, just really elevate that, that sense of pride with the students.

590
01:04:04,558 --> 01:04:21,848
Um, and this is actually, these are some images that, um, relate not just to the culture of the students, but then also just the, you know, how can we connect school and the design, um, and the building to just

591
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:23,497
community at large too.

592
01:04:23,977 --> 01:04:29,199
So it's not just the student identity, but also the community identity.

593
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:38,861
And so there are many ways to be able to represent that through environmental graphics, through design.

594
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:51,865
And these are a few ways in how we've done it just across some schools, but Medford will go through a process

595
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:59,521
in trying to understand how can we best represent Medford and your students throughout the architecture.

596
01:05:03,706 --> 01:05:03,886
Okay.

597
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:12,537
Thoughts on this particular collection of ideas, priorities,

598
01:05:14,993 --> 01:05:17,095
Yeah, can I add, Matt?

599
01:05:18,156 --> 01:05:19,597
This is Chelsea, if you can see me.

600
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:22,759
Thank you.

601
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:30,365
We've talked a lot about making sure that the EL classrooms are core classrooms that are embedded in their learning communities.

602
01:05:31,186 --> 01:05:36,670
But I think the registration hub is a great place to sort of embed some of this identity.

603
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:41,574
and celebrate the linguistic and cultural diversity.

604
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:54,445
So I just wanted to say that I think that that's a really great opportunity to bring some of these images from the culture slides into that parent registration EL hub space too.

605
01:05:56,287 --> 01:06:01,051
I know we've talked also, Chelsea, about the concept of affinity spaces as well.

606
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:03,453
And those are a great opportunity, I think,

607
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:13,488
to reinforce sort of through the visual and the design of the space, opportunities just to reflect culture back, right?

608
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:17,251
Yeah, exactly.

609
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:40,086
I think going back to the performing arts section, I think it's also, I really liked the theater and black box ideas to have and the window to show stuff just to really make sure that there's enough space for everyone to have a space at the high school where they're able to do their arts.

610
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:43,387
And then also where they're able to be known.

611
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:44,827
And I think that's really important.

612
01:06:47,688 --> 01:06:48,248
Appreciate that.

613
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:48,548
Thank you.

614
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:54,664
We know that your students are doing some really great work.

615
01:06:55,144 --> 01:07:00,305
And so we want to be able to highlight that and want everyone to be able to see those things.

616
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:05,027
I know, I know it's 508.

617
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:20,852
So when we talk about flexible and future ready design and a building that can adapt as your curriculum and your student body evolves as

618
01:07:21,442 --> 01:07:24,364
You know, as time goes on, we know that education evolves.

619
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:31,089
And so how can we best prepare for those types of future changes?

620
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:37,734
So, you know, the key is to really be flexible, to provide agile classrooms, agile spaces.

621
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:44,500
And, you know, we know that already some of your classrooms are doing this.

622
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:50,164
Some of your teachers are trying to do what they can with, you know, what they have in terms of

623
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:57,287
trying to provide small group instruction, doing more collaborative work.

624
01:07:57,368 --> 01:08:16,515
So providing you with the types of furnishings and equipment to be able to easily adapt your space, depending on the curriculum delivery, I think is going to be a really key component of that.

625
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:29,699
Um, and so things that can, um, easily be reconfigured, uh, without having to, you know, spend 10 minutes for the teacher to have to do it all on their own.

626
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:41,345
Um, and this is also the type of, um, this also helps support, you know, the, the differentiated learning styles that your students do have.

627
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:46,088
So, um, not everyone can learn in that, that top right

628
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:56,457
And so, we're seeing a lot of the small group work, you know, being able to turn and do partner work as well.

629
01:08:57,378 --> 01:09:03,083
So, this type of flexible furnishing is going to be critical to your school.

630
01:09:11,668 --> 01:09:17,290
But I think some of the classrooms we've seen in other schools, maybe there's dividers between classrooms that can open and close.

631
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,192
Are there other ideas for creating flexible spaces?

632
01:09:20,612 --> 01:09:23,153
Yeah, you'll see them.

633
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:39,099
It was hard to, as I started putting the titles on some of these slides, because really a lot of these slides can really depict more than one thing.

634
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,500
So a lot of the slides that we've seen before

635
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,481
do are also those types of flexible spaces.

636
01:09:44,422 --> 01:09:50,104
But we'll see them again just in the next couple of slides, too.

637
01:09:52,045 --> 01:09:55,667
And so we've talked a lot about the need for collaboration spaces.

638
01:09:55,927 --> 01:10:07,392
And in some of the visioning, we have the visioning team has identified what types of collaboration spaces they'd like to see.

639
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:12,834
We want them to be purposeful.

640
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:14,836
They want to be intentional.

641
01:10:15,276 --> 01:10:16,758
What sizes do they want to be?

642
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:20,942
The location of where they are is going to be critical too.

643
01:10:21,503 --> 01:10:28,750
But again, providing the opportunity to be able to pull out of the classroom,

644
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:43,802
and give students a different type of learning experience than just within their classroom is gonna be a priority here too.

645
01:10:46,944 --> 01:10:51,508
And then, so Lisa, this is one of those types of spaces.

646
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:54,730
So large group instructional spaces.

647
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:59,454
I mean, this is considered a large group instructional space, right?

648
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:01,989
It's not necessarily an assigned space.

649
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:03,750
It can be signed out.

650
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:17,679
But providing a space that is multifunctional, you could have two or three classrooms meet within one space.

651
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:27,384
If you've got a speaker coming, you can set up these rooms to have also remote capability.

652
01:11:27,504 --> 01:11:28,365
So we've heard from

653
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:45,320
like world language that it would be great to be able to get, you know, my, my Italian one kids together and be able to zoom in and have like a virtual meetup with the class in Italy, who they're learning English.

654
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:57,070
And so being able to, you know, use that space for across all of the disciplines departments and also community groups too.

655
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,311
So we've talked a lot about

656
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:08,140
how the school also needs to, the school should prioritize also connections back to the Medford community at large.

657
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:20,125
And so this is a space that, and this is a space that where the school committee, correct, the school committee at the school actually holds their meeting.

658
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:27,468
But you could have another community group that wants to come in and use this

659
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:30,350
There, you go to the next.

660
01:12:33,572 --> 01:12:41,715
And so the dining commons, it's a large space in which it's occupied.

661
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:45,676
Yes, it's used for lunch, but after hours.

662
01:12:46,297 --> 01:12:56,861
Could that be a space in which there is another community group coming in or a large, maybe there is like a sports banquet being held here

663
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:06,684
maybe there is a speaker that comes in, and if there's a learning stair, then that could be used as a seating for it.

664
01:13:08,105 --> 01:13:11,808
But all of these spaces, we also have a media center on the right.

665
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:20,694
These are spaces that can be, that are used, can be used by the community.

666
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:28,140
We already know that your, many spaces within your building already,

667
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:31,808
are being utilized by the community and being rented out anyhow.

668
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:43,073
And so when we design and start planning where these spaces will go, we'll also be thinking a lot about how the community accesses them.

669
01:13:43,373 --> 01:13:45,714
How can we do it in a safe way?

670
01:13:45,794 --> 01:13:52,036
How can we close off access to other parts of the building that we don't want the community necessarily going into?

671
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:57,238
And how people are accessing the site as well.

672
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,890
the auditorium would be another one of those spaces.

673
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:02,311
Sorry.

674
01:14:03,671 --> 01:14:04,051
That's good.

675
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:05,951
I have a question.

676
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:06,412
Yes.

677
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:08,812
I'm Cooper Seager.

678
01:14:08,872 --> 01:14:12,173
I'm a senior at MedCon.

679
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:23,975
When I think about community and equity you guys are trying to create, yeah, I think about the dining and athletics department and even the library.

680
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:26,196
Have you guys taken, like,

681
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:32,131
I guess, started considering what the spaces would look like for those areas.

682
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:39,615
Because right now, that is where I find, where I see the student body makes the most connection.

683
01:14:42,977 --> 01:14:47,199
I mean, no, we're not at the design phase just yet.

684
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:52,322
But we are talking a lot about what

685
01:14:55,651 --> 01:14:57,552
What is the dining commons?

686
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:14,761
How do we want it to serve not just the students, you know, and not just during your breakfast and lunch hours, but is it available for use outside of those hours, right?

687
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:23,205
And I would say, Cooper, that between the, because they all have interviewed some students and had some student panels,

688
01:15:24,028 --> 01:15:40,335
even when we did the belonging video at the beginning of the year, those three spaces that you highlighted have come up again and again, that students have elevated that as those are really important spaces for them.

689
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:47,698
So I think when we get into the design phase, I think that input will be really important.

690
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:52,280
Yeah, I think in addition to the design of the spaces, which is obviously

691
01:15:52,855 --> 01:15:56,598
critically important and to support all the activity that's happening here.

692
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,941
It's also the location of these spaces within the overall building, right?

693
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:06,847
Having like right now where the library is, is actually fairly central, but the gym is all the way at one end of the building, right?

694
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:12,772
So there's a lot of cases where people are not experiencing the gym unless they're making a deliberate effort to go all that distance.

695
01:16:13,212 --> 01:16:19,397
So try to find ways of like the auditorium, bringing these centralized spaces, the library,

696
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:30,756
into the middle of the building so that we really maximize the opportunities for people to interact there and experience those spaces is going to be one of the things that we focus on as we go forward.

697
01:16:31,557 --> 01:16:32,537
It's very perceptive though.

698
01:16:37,314 --> 01:16:48,560
related but slightly different track, mostly with like desks and classrooms, making sure that there's enough space on top of them for like a computer and like a binder and a paper.

699
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:56,924
Recently one of my class, a year or something ago, one of my classrooms got new desks and the tops of them are tiny, like I can't fit a Chromebook and a paper on it.

700
01:16:57,344 --> 01:16:59,145
And that doesn't really work during class.

701
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:03,503
Yeah, that's a wonderful observation.

702
01:17:03,543 --> 01:17:09,745
I know we've gotten lots of questions about sort of that whenever the subject of new desks and new desk shapes have come up.

703
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:24,590
So something that will be coming in the future as one of our activities is we do like a mini furniture fair within the school where we'll actually have different vendors bring in different desks, different chairs, and some other pieces of furniture as well.

704
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:27,171
And so we'll bring people in and have the opportunity to vote

705
01:17:28,483 --> 01:17:37,808
options to see what works and you'll be able to take your Chromebook in and put it down there and make sure that that's not going to fall off when you also have your notebook there and those types of things.

706
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:41,149
But it's definitely a critical part of the process as we go forward.

707
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:50,234
Any other thoughts on this piece of it?

708
01:17:50,494 --> 01:17:53,195
This was the last section, so we're actually okay on time.

709
01:17:53,918 --> 01:17:58,420
because we're getting close to 530, and we just have a couple of additional slides afterwards.

710
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,202
So if anyone was hesitating because you were worried about time, you're good.

711
01:18:03,222 --> 01:18:06,443
This is Jenny.

712
01:18:06,463 --> 01:18:09,845
Go ahead, Jenny, and then we'll let Lisa go.

713
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:14,767
I actually just had a question for the students who are on the call.

714
01:18:14,827 --> 01:18:17,648
I didn't hear any student reactions to the

715
01:18:18,631 --> 01:18:19,952
bathroom options.

716
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:34,558
I'm just, I'm just curious, like, tell, tell us what young people think about this so that the rest of the old people in the room can start to, like, get in, get in alignment with how you all are thinking about this.

717
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:38,339
Oh, for sure.

718
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:46,983
Um, I know I've been in some various bathrooms, like Northeastern's EXP building.

719
01:18:47,512 --> 01:18:56,576
they have these all gender bathrooms that people can go into and it's more, it's like an airport where there is no door and you can walk in.

720
01:18:57,336 --> 01:19:05,379
And the thing that makes it so, uh, I guess secure is the door comes from floor to ceiling, right?

721
01:19:05,519 --> 01:19:10,821
It's, it's pretty, pretty locked and you can do whatever you need to do there.

722
01:19:11,682 --> 01:19:15,863
Um, and yet there's, I guess it feels open.

723
01:19:16,444 --> 01:19:16,944
And so,

724
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:33,474
I think the idea of having an all-gender restroom, again, for equity purposes, trying to not place a name on your gender, but also the fact that it can interchange if need be, is really smart.

725
01:19:33,654 --> 01:19:36,616
I mean, personally, it's just a small design.

726
01:19:42,738 --> 01:19:44,058
I agree with Cooper.

727
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:52,861
And then also making sure that at the same time, yeah, there's stalls that fully cover because there's lots of gaps in the ones we currently have.

728
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:59,963
And then keeping it like vape detectors be helpful that are like, checked and

729
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:13,409
fully utilized because I think a big reason that the bigger bathrooms are closed off and a lot of bathrooms are closed off is because we don't want just gatherings of people vaping, but that's happening anyways.

730
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:21,773
And so finding ways to make those who are using it comfortable and then also to try to move that out.

731
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:26,714
There are particular design details.

732
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:47,182
If we do end up using partitions that are called zero sightline partitions that are detailed to joints in a particular way that eliminate those gaps, but certainly what Cooper was alluding to as well in terms of just doing full height partitions and actual doors is another way to sort of create the sense of privacy that's really critical to this type of approach if we go down that road.

733
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:49,423
Thank you.

734
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:51,784
Those are really insightful comments.

735
01:20:52,024 --> 01:20:52,544
Thank you guys.

736
01:20:54,174 --> 01:20:59,816
And not only the students noted the need for stall doors that do not have gaps.

737
01:21:00,337 --> 01:21:02,377
So Norman had added that in the chat.

738
01:21:02,978 --> 01:21:03,278
OK.

739
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:03,918
Yeah.

740
01:21:03,938 --> 01:21:04,578
Thank you, Norm.

741
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:20,505
And I do think for the students, we welcome you to come join us at other meetings where we're going to talk about these things because we adults can get really

742
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:23,534
stuck in our ways.

743
01:21:23,994 --> 01:21:33,240
And we will, I can promise you, we will have a conversation about bathrooms at some point in a building committee meeting coming your way very, very soon.

744
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:42,045
And I want to make sure that we are listening to what students are telling us about their experience.

745
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:49,770
And it will be, if you and or your friends are able to join us at some of those meetings,

746
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,764
your input would be very valuable.

747
01:21:52,904 --> 01:21:59,685
And I think it would help the adults in the room understand that high school is different now than it used to be.

748
01:21:59,885 --> 01:22:10,768
And that's, it's really hard to remember that when you are in a high school and you remember going to high school and then you're seeing something that is just a complete departure from your experience.

749
01:22:10,828 --> 01:22:18,450
So I would just encourage you all to keep joining us and encourage your friends to do the same because we want to hear from you.

750
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:29,083
And I think as a precursor, we will have a dedicated group, I think, that's going to really focus in on exclusively toilet rooms.

751
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:31,685
And to me, that's actually a really exciting thing.

752
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:35,428
I think that could be a really interesting discussion as we go forward.

753
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:42,273
So I echo Jenny's sentiments that we're really going to want to pull in as much student voice there as possible.

754
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:46,483
Just like I can't wrap my head around that being a whole group, Matt.

755
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:49,925
So I'm going to think about whether I want to be on that one or not.

756
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:52,447
I appreciate that it's happening.

757
01:22:53,007 --> 01:22:54,068
In your free time, Jenny.

758
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:57,650
Lisa?

759
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:00,252
I just wanted to do a quick clarification.

760
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:05,135
I think I saw somewhere, sort of brought up the dining hall, and I made me think about this.

761
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:10,038
Are we going to be required to have three lunch periods now?

762
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:11,159
Is that my understanding?

763
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:12,160
So, OK.

764
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:12,660
Correct.

765
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:19,648
So we'll have less cafeteria space and the space will be used for three bunches.

766
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:21,269
Is that right?

767
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:24,531
It is correct on a square footage basis.

768
01:23:24,571 --> 01:23:28,593
Yeah, it's again along the same concept of efficiency of the space.

769
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:39,218
They're looking to sort of manage the amount of size, but what we're going to be doing, which should be a tremendous benefit, is centralizing the cafeteria space so that there's not multiple spaces that need to be

770
01:23:39,732 --> 01:23:58,747
managed and oversaw during the course of a school day, which I think will make the experience much more pleasant for everybody in the school in terms of being able to just be in one space that, as Rosemary was saying, has a lot of differentiated seating opportunities and is sort of a welcoming and comfortable place to be in.

771
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:07,133
So I know that when we visited schools, almost all of the new schools, all of them had kind of a big central open dining area rather

772
01:24:08,078 --> 01:24:16,565
cafeteria room, it was almost like sort of part of the first kind of a lobby, just like a big open area.

773
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,608
Is that kind of the norm now for new buildings?

774
01:24:19,648 --> 01:24:23,931
You see it in a lot of buildings, but again, we don't necessarily know that's where we're going to end up.

775
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:26,673
That's going to be part of the design discussions as we start to go forward.

776
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:32,739
We'll look at options that have that and options that maybe have more of a closed off room and see what feels better here.

777
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:36,842
And I know that we're coming up against time, but I do want to just say that

778
01:24:37,185 --> 01:24:41,707
You know, we have heard a lot about the need for quiet dining spaces too.

779
01:24:43,227 --> 01:24:53,031
And so that's something that we are, you know, definitely looking at how can we incorporate that into whatever the design ends up being.

780
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:56,452
All right.

781
01:24:56,512 --> 01:24:59,453
So just to foreshadow a bit in terms of where we're going.

782
01:25:00,273 --> 01:25:04,575
So this is our second review and respond meeting that we're having for this advisory team.

783
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:10,133
We will have our next meeting actually during the next phase of the feasibility study.

784
01:25:10,153 --> 01:25:14,136
And this is where it just gets bogged down in the semantics of things.

785
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:17,918
But on March 10th is when our next meeting is going to occur.

786
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:29,967
And at that meeting, we'll actually go through in a little bit more granular detail each of the sort of design aspects that we're going to be looking to include from this advisory team in the project moving forward.

787
01:25:30,027 --> 01:25:33,229
And we're going to categorize them in a real simple way of like stoplights.

788
01:25:33,773 --> 01:25:34,994
or traffic lights, right?

789
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:42,181
So we have a green, which is going to be a given item that is just going to get included in the project, similar to the ones that Rosemary ran through at the beginning.

790
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:43,322
Those will be included there.

791
01:25:43,863 --> 01:25:47,966
But there's other things that people have brought up that is just no question we're going to include it.

792
01:25:47,986 --> 01:25:59,037
There's going to be some that are going to be sort of the yellow flashing items that we're going to talk about here and agree as to whether or not this is something we want to wrap into the design process or not.

793
01:25:59,433 --> 01:26:06,419
And then there's probably going to be some red light items as well, that while they might be sort of interesting ideas, we don't necessarily want to carry those forward.

794
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,263
So we'll be doing that for every design advisory team as we go forward.

795
01:26:11,724 --> 01:26:17,468
And then that list of green lights and yellow lights and red lights will then be brought back to the full building committee.

796
01:26:18,189 --> 01:26:24,474
And then those will actually be sort of approved or authorized to sort of go into the

797
01:26:25,573 --> 01:26:26,594
the project moving forward.

798
01:26:26,794 --> 01:26:30,716
And so that's really how the organization of these advisory teams is going to work.

799
01:26:33,598 --> 01:26:37,421
And again, this is really just describing what I ran over just now.

800
01:26:37,981 --> 01:26:41,543
So again, we're going to be March 10th.

801
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,085
We're going to do 4 o'clock for this meeting.

802
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,447
It will again be remote hybrid.

803
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:53,051
I think even with the technical hiccups that were here, I think this actually felt a little bit better in terms of people being in the room.

804
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:58,012
Certainly people that are not in the room, we appreciate your presence here.

805
01:26:58,032 --> 01:27:04,396
In terms of dialing in remotely, you know it's tough to sort of make it here at four o'clock on any weekday.

806
01:27:05,256 --> 01:27:10,799
So the more that you can join us in whatever way, we're appreciative of your time and thank you.

807
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,783
So we will have access to the slides.

808
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:19,824
I think the recording of this meeting will also be available.

809
01:27:20,024 --> 01:27:21,385
I think, Will, can you confirm that?

810
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:23,851
It'll be on YouTube.

811
01:27:24,491 --> 01:27:26,793
Okay, similar to the first round of meetings as well.

812
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,014
So you can sort of view it that way.

813
01:27:28,514 --> 01:27:28,674
Yep.

814
01:27:30,776 --> 01:27:32,097
Somebody asked me.

815
01:27:33,338 --> 01:27:36,240
Okay, I think we can we can find a way to make that available.

816
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:40,363
All right.

817
01:27:40,383 --> 01:27:40,983
Thank you, everybody.

818
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:45,547
We're gonna we're gonna keep the meeting live because we're switching over to the next advisory team.

819
01:27:46,648 --> 01:27:50,010
If which if you're saying for that, please do stick around.

820
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:50,851
But

821
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,348
If you're not, you're also welcome to go.

822
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:57,769
This is the site safety and security.

823
01:27:57,809 --> 01:27:58,450
Thank you, Jackie.

824
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:00,510
Site safety and security.

825
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:04,032
Site safety and security.

826
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:06,332
Thank you.

827
01:28:10,094 --> 01:28:14,355
Do you want to just give that to folks?

828
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:15,115
Thank you for coming.

829
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:22,929
It's a group project.

830
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:23,670
I was having

831
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:19,875
Hi everyone, we're we're just switching over presentation over at the Medford High School.

832
01:29:19,895 --> 01:29:22,738
We're having a little trouble with the owl on the camera so.

833
01:29:24,299 --> 01:29:28,543
We'll see how meeting 2 goes, so just sit tight and we'll get started shortly.

834
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:41,157
For those that are online, we're just going to get going probably in about two minutes or so.

835
01:32:41,237 --> 01:32:47,440
I'm just flunking around with the AV setup again, just to make sure I have some power and that we have video here.

836
01:32:48,486 --> 01:32:51,205
So bear with us for a couple more minutes and we'll get going.

837
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:00,175
All right.

838
01:34:00,195 --> 01:34:06,918
Just as a quick check, can folks online see the intended version of the presentation?

839
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:08,019
Yes.

840
01:34:08,259 --> 01:34:08,479
Yes.

841
01:34:08,799 --> 01:34:09,600
Looks good.

842
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:10,640
Okay.

843
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,221
Lovely.

844
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:12,001
Thank you.

845
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:15,963
All right.

846
01:34:18,784 --> 01:34:28,209
And I think we're going to get going just so that we try to stay on

847
01:34:29,895 --> 01:34:30,535
schedule here.

848
01:34:32,396 --> 01:34:44,579
We do have a sign-in sheet that is moving around the room that we have here that we will use afterwards, and then we have the online attendance that we'll be able to sort of collect overall attendance from.

849
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:50,321
So I know Helen just sent me a question about who is in the room, but I think we'll have that through the sign-in sheet.

850
01:34:50,341 --> 01:34:53,442
I do want to welcome everybody.

851
01:34:53,502 --> 01:34:55,823
So this is our site safety and security

852
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,684
team meeting for the new or reimagined Medford High School project.

853
01:35:03,165 --> 01:35:16,156
This is our second meeting of the series that we've had so far, and just as a quick overview of what we're going to cover today, we're just going to do a very quick round of introductions of the design team.

854
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:18,351
so everyone knows who's here.

855
01:35:19,151 --> 01:35:23,673
We're not going to do individual team member introductions again, because we did that last time.

856
01:35:23,733 --> 01:35:40,860
I will, though, say if there are folks that are new that were intended to be on the advisory team but weren't able to join us for the first meeting, I do want to take a couple minutes and just give them the opportunity to introduce themselves and indicate the connection to the project and priorities and goals similar as we did during the first meeting.

857
01:35:42,515 --> 01:35:50,742
And then we're going to move really to the bulk of the meeting, which is reviewing the comments and the priorities that everyone outlined previously.

858
01:35:51,603 --> 01:36:05,216
The way that we're going to do that is not go through every individual line, but we've actually collected the priorities that everyone has shared with us into a series of about five topics that we're going to go through.

859
01:36:05,336 --> 01:36:07,158
And we're going to share some information back.

860
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,511
based on those priorities that we heard.

861
01:36:10,091 --> 01:36:19,455
There may be a couple of topics as well that we didn't hear necessarily from the group, but we wanted to make sure that we cover here today, just as part of the process.

862
01:36:19,475 --> 01:36:22,457
So it will be that mix of topics and priorities.

863
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:36,303
And then we'll just do a quick preview in terms of where we're going, which is if you caught the end of the educational planning equity meeting, that's going to be very similar, but we'll tell you when the next, the third meeting is going to be occurring.

864
01:36:37,706 --> 01:36:41,948
So just to do the introductions really quickly for the design and OPM team.

865
01:36:42,188 --> 01:36:43,649
Again, my name is Matt Rice.

866
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:47,711
I'm an architect and I'm the principal in charge for SMMA.

867
01:36:48,712 --> 01:36:50,913
And we'll go through the room here and then we'll go online.

868
01:36:51,753 --> 01:36:53,594
I'm Laura Swan, civil engineer.

869
01:36:54,214 --> 01:36:55,975
Hi everyone.

870
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:01,098
Alright, and then online if you want to go Helen.

871
01:37:01,498 --> 01:37:02,719
Sure, good evening.

872
01:37:02,759 --> 01:37:04,780
Helen Fantini, project manager with SMMA.

873
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,321
Alright, and then Kate.

874
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:12,864
Hi all, Kate Tooke, Landscape Architect and Principal with Agency Landscape and Planning.

875
01:37:12,904 --> 01:37:14,584
We're sub-consultants to SMMA.

876
01:37:14,624 --> 01:37:17,165
All right, and Matt.

877
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:18,826
Sorry, Matt.

878
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,147
Sorry, got to come back.

879
01:37:22,007 --> 01:37:25,029
Go ahead, Matt, you can go.

880
01:37:25,489 --> 01:37:30,611
Oh, hi, I'm Matt Galino, day-to-day project manager for Leftfield, who's the owner's project manager.

881
01:37:36,557 --> 01:37:39,459
Jen Carlson, yep, sorry, I wasn't sure if we were going back to the other Matt.

882
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:43,541
Jen Carlson, also an OPM with Leftfield.

883
01:37:46,063 --> 01:37:47,203
And Matt, why don't you go now?

884
01:37:47,884 --> 01:37:50,965
Okay, Matt Elaine, Good Harbor Techmark Security Consultant.

885
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:52,686
All right, great.

886
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:57,269
And Adele Sands, I'm the Education Liaison for Leftfield.

887
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:58,990
Thank you, Adele.

888
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:04,933
Sorry, we didn't get your photo on here, but appreciate you sticking with us through the site safety security meeting as well.

889
01:38:05,514 --> 01:38:05,854
No worries.

890
01:38:06,512 --> 01:38:09,515
And Matt, I see a couple of other agents on the call.

891
01:38:10,556 --> 01:38:10,936
Barrett?

892
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:15,320
Hi, everyone.

893
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,845
My name is Barrett Cherokee, and I'm a landscape designer with Agency Landscape and Planning.

894
01:38:19,865 --> 01:38:28,493
Yeah, so alongside Kate Tuch and Keisha Rodrigo, who's also on the call.

895
01:38:28,513 --> 01:38:31,776
All right.

896
01:38:32,953 --> 01:38:39,558
Again, do we have any new Medford members that weren't able to make the first meeting that would like to just introduce themselves?

897
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:49,164
I'm seeing no in the room, and I'm hearing no online, so we'll keep going then.

898
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:59,892
This is the group, though, that we assembled for the last meeting and ran through everyone's thoughts.

899
01:39:02,945 --> 01:39:11,087
And again, just big picture schedule, this is where we are in terms of what we're projecting for the schedule of the project.

900
01:39:11,827 --> 01:39:17,888
We are looking to open, again, the newer reimagined school in the fall of 2030.

901
01:39:17,928 --> 01:39:26,270
And we are currently in the first part of our feasibility study, the stars indicating our advisory team touch points.

902
01:39:27,757 --> 01:39:29,738
This is the second of those discussions.

903
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:32,199
We'll be meeting a third time moving forward.

904
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:34,800
We'll give you the date for that in a little bit.

905
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:43,744
And then we'll meet again at the start of the schematic design phase moving forward, which is going to be towards the fall of this year.

906
01:39:45,344 --> 01:39:46,885
And just as a very quick refresher,

907
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:52,851
Again, this is one of four different advisory teams that we're conducting a series of meetings for.

908
01:39:52,911 --> 01:40:11,820
These are not intended to be or could they be siloed discussions, but we want to make sure that we give each of these areas enough space for discussion as we move forward so that we can understand where the priorities are for the city, for the school, for the district moving forward.

909
01:40:14,862 --> 01:40:15,342
And then just

910
01:40:15,806 --> 01:40:41,516
very quickly again, the objective for this particular advisory team meeting or this advisory team is really to focus on topics of site safety, security, circulation across the site, and all the different perspectives that some of our city departments have in terms of how the site is viewed and interacted with on a sometimes a daily basis.

911
01:40:44,217 --> 01:40:44,417
So,

912
01:40:45,668 --> 01:40:50,691
I think with this, I'm going to turn it over maybe to Laura to kick things off, or we're going to go right to Kate.

913
01:40:51,991 --> 01:40:54,272
We can go right to Kate.

914
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:55,253
Okay.

915
01:40:55,413 --> 01:41:08,740
And then just to give everybody a quick preview of our topics moving forward, we are going to present on each of the sort of groupings that we have, and then we're going to have a little bit of discussion on each of the groupings.

916
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,602
So we're not going to be talking to you for an extended amount of time and then wait, circle back.

917
01:41:13,384 --> 01:41:16,306
So there will be opportunities for engagement as we move through.

918
01:41:18,187 --> 01:41:19,748
I think security is first.

919
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:26,132
Yeah, Laura, I'm going to tag you back to summarize what was on that slide and dive into security.

920
01:41:27,173 --> 01:41:28,834
Okay.

921
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:32,156
So we heard back and quoted all the comments.

922
01:41:33,497 --> 01:41:42,823
One of the biggest things that people mentioned was an accessible site, circulation around the site, improved security,

923
01:41:43,559 --> 01:41:51,581
and this desire to have an open, welcoming site that could bring the community in, but also be secure.

924
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:59,003
I think that you'll hear a lot about that as we go through all of these topics.

925
01:42:00,104 --> 01:42:03,665
And you'll see that reflected in what you see.

926
01:42:04,265 --> 01:42:12,627
And if there's anything else that we've missed or that we do need to hear back from you, please, there'll be lots of opportunity to share.

927
01:42:16,142 --> 01:42:23,709
Just as a quick reminder, I think for everybody in the room here, our audio is going through our little conference puck at the front there.

928
01:42:23,729 --> 01:42:30,196
So I think if we can all just do our best to speak up, it'll be helpful for the folks online to be able to hear us clearly.

929
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:33,459
Sure.

930
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:40,886
So we'll start with balancing the open campus and community access with safety, and then talk about

931
01:42:41,457 --> 01:42:46,558
mobility and access across the site, how to make this a connected Medford destination.

932
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:55,341
Then go into program and operations, how this is going to be an active site every day year round.

933
01:42:56,421 --> 01:43:04,404
We've heard about all the programs on the weekend and everything that happens at this school pretty much every day of the year.

934
01:43:05,904 --> 01:43:09,405
Also then discussing the physical site and

935
01:43:10,134 --> 01:43:12,536
It's unique location between the fells and the city.

936
01:43:13,216 --> 01:43:18,620
And we'll end up talking about construction site safety because there will be construction.

937
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:27,045
And what would that mean for the students and their experience here in the population that is on site while that happens?

938
01:43:27,065 --> 01:43:30,648
All right.

939
01:43:30,688 --> 01:43:32,089
So now we're going to kick it over to Madeline.

940
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,621
Okay, thank you everybody.

941
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:47,748
Um, so I'm going to talk a little bit about site safety and security I do have, I think there's about four slides or so I'll run through them and then if there's any questions after we can go through, go through that.

942
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:52,091
But, you know, in order to frame the discussion about, you know, school site safety.

943
01:43:53,452 --> 01:43:59,776
The site itself is really the first layer of defense before the doors, before cameras, before staff response.

944
01:43:59,877 --> 01:44:07,422
So the goal here is to balance an open welcoming campus with clear and intentional safety measures.

945
01:44:07,982 --> 01:44:17,269
As said in the previous slide, we're not really trying to harden the site to make it feel institutional, but we want to design it safely for everyday use for staff, students, and visitors.

946
01:44:18,488 --> 01:44:26,110
So one of the ways that we're going to look at doing this and use as our guiding principles is the crime prevention through environmental design principles.

947
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:39,834
And I know one of the members brought this up in the last meeting, so they stole my thunder a little bit, but that's good because we're going to use these principles as we look at the site and the design through the options that are going to be presented to you.

948
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:56,560
And there's essentially five principles that will be looking for natural surveillance, you know, seen, and be seen natural access control, guiding how people enter and move about the space territorial reinforcement, which makes it clear that this is a school space.

949
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:16,680
Maintenance and visibility, we try to keep the spaces well kept and the feeling of always being able to see onto the site so people feel like they are not necessarily surveilled, but they can be seen to reduce some activity that really isn't supported by the site.

950
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:19,142
And the last one is activity support.

951
01:45:19,242 --> 01:45:24,808
And again, this goes about making the site used for legitimate use and discourage misuse.

952
01:45:25,869 --> 01:45:33,116
So all these strategies work best when they're designed, when operations support them, and all the policies and procedures align.

953
01:45:34,284 --> 01:45:48,334
Some of the things on here I'll just point out quickly, we'd be looking, and some of these have to do with the school design as well, but we'll be looking at large windows, clear sight lines, appropriately scaled lighting to support after hours activities.

954
01:45:49,715 --> 01:45:55,939
We'll look at landscaping, we'll look at fencing, we'll look at vegetation to define boundaries without creating hiding spaces.

955
01:45:56,660 --> 01:46:02,864
And then we'll look at sidewalks and pathways that encourage predictable movement along the site.

956
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,720
We want to jump to the next slide.

957
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:21,265
Some of the other things that we're looking at here, you know, speaking about windows is you know they play a dual role right so windows allow visibility, but there's also vulnerability as well for them so we'll be looking at different ways to.

958
01:46:22,705 --> 01:46:28,749
protect the windows, either through blinds, controlling shelter-in-place activities or lockdown situations.

959
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:35,193
We'll be looking at potential for security film, for reducing entry.

960
01:46:36,114 --> 01:46:47,841
And then there's also gonna be situations where we might look at impact-resistant glazing at select high-risk areas, specifically probably around the main entrance vestibules and potentially some other areas of the school.

961
01:46:50,222 --> 01:46:50,563
Next slide.

962
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:59,451
The way to balance the open campus and community access is through electronics.

963
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:03,835
We'll be using an electronic access control and security management system.

964
01:47:04,336 --> 01:47:16,066
You know, these platforms allow, you know, camera visibility, the control of doors, receiving alerts, response, you know, from staff members as well as outside emergency personnel as well.

965
01:47:16,546 --> 01:47:27,714
So this will all be balanced from the access control system, the video management system, as well as some other devices as well for intrusion detection, and then security communications.

966
01:47:28,195 --> 01:47:30,236
And I think we'll hit that on one of the next slides.

967
01:47:33,818 --> 01:47:41,322
The communication part of this really helps to connect exterior spaces with the interior spaces.

968
01:47:41,342 --> 01:47:50,527
So we'll be looking at door stations on the exterior where visitors will have an opportunity to speak with staff inside the building to allow entry.

969
01:47:51,367 --> 01:48:01,933
We'll also be looking at other devices as well that could be put out in the fields or in the parking lot that provide emergency communication outside of school hours

970
01:48:02,753 --> 01:48:11,478
that can provide reduced response times for staff and emergency personnel.

971
01:48:17,822 --> 01:48:27,067
I think that's a collection of slides that we have and I think I do want to just reinforce something I think we heard from Chief Buckley at the last meeting that

972
01:48:27,797 --> 01:48:34,540
The topic of school security and safety is obviously a very sensitive one these days, given recent events.

973
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:54,647
And so it's certainly okay to talk about these in generalities as part of this meeting, but we will be holding detailed discussions with school administration, district administration, as well as the first responders to sort of sort out the details of the security approach that we're not going to necessarily be getting into.

974
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:01,123
in sort of this larger context, but that's really part of like the overall strategy of how we're designing the building.

975
01:49:02,024 --> 01:49:13,670
But we're happy to talk about any thoughts that anyone has given any of what Matt has gone through here today, reactions, reinforcements of yes, we love that or no, we should think about this.

976
01:49:14,751 --> 01:49:18,633
Anything that was maybe not covered on that topic that we want to run through.

977
01:49:27,275 --> 01:49:29,636
And it's okay if we're quiet, that's fine.

978
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:33,959
It actually gives us some more time for discussion on the later topics.

979
01:49:34,059 --> 01:49:35,479
And I'm not going to turn that down.

980
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:43,464
I just want to make sure that folks online as well, please feel free to unmute if you are muted and pipe in if there's any thoughts or comments here.

981
01:49:48,326 --> 01:49:49,487
All right, going once, twice.

982
01:49:50,487 --> 01:49:51,508
We're going to move along then.

983
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:55,934
All right, Kate, I think you're up here.

984
01:49:55,954 --> 01:49:56,935
Sure.

985
01:49:57,015 --> 01:49:57,355
Yeah.

986
01:49:57,435 --> 01:50:03,018
So this group had a really robust and lively discussion back in December before the holiday.

987
01:50:03,878 --> 01:50:10,642
And what we've done tonight is try to just reflect back some of the really productive conversation that you all had.

988
01:50:11,797 --> 01:50:29,031
and add a little bit to it based on what we know about the site, and then open it up to a little bit more dialogue for you all to add more color in terms of what's needed, desired, and any pain points about the existing site that you're hoping would be addressed as part of this process.

989
01:50:30,512 --> 01:50:37,658
So what we've done is we've taken that feedback that you shared both in person as well as afterwards and some written comments

990
01:50:38,338 --> 01:50:42,500
and categorize those into three big picture categories.

991
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:51,324
The first is really about mobility and access, thinking about what you shared about making this a destination that's connected to Medford.

992
01:50:52,124 --> 01:51:04,290
These are a lot of the comments you had about arrival and egress, circulation moving to and through the site, the ADA compliance questions, and then some of the emergency vehicle access and service access.

993
01:51:05,581 --> 01:51:08,864
We heard from you a lot about program and operations as well.

994
01:51:09,004 --> 01:51:19,733
So this idea that you want this to be a place that's active and it's every day and it's year round, it already is, and you want that kind of access to continue.

995
01:51:19,813 --> 01:51:23,717
So site amenities that support that activity, such as fields,

996
01:51:25,178 --> 01:51:37,112
and gathering spaces, school and community resources that sit on site, like the preschool facilities, as well as site security and management, which Matt just touched on a little bit.

997
01:51:37,192 --> 01:51:43,600
So how does that all feel safe and cohesive, even at night and even at times when school is not in session?

998
01:51:45,007 --> 01:51:47,470
And finally, you shared quite a bit about the physical site.

999
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:54,336
There was a lot in your commentary about the unique topography and vegetation and the unique location next to the fells.

1000
01:51:54,976 --> 01:51:57,779
And it's something the design team has also been thinking a lot about.

1001
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:09,830
You also shared a lot of comments about how that should be treated around construction logistics and how the site materiality and permanence and character could reflect some of those unique pieces.

1002
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:20,778
So again, for each of these, what we'll do is we'll share a little bit about what some of the key data points are, as well as what you shared, and then open it up to conversation kind of one at a time.

1003
01:52:20,858 --> 01:52:23,880
So we're going to dive into mobility and access first.

1004
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:29,704
That was the first category that you all really shared a lot about, as Laura shared.

1005
01:52:30,654 --> 01:52:38,157
So big picture, if you look at kind of how students are arriving to site, there are three big categories.

1006
01:52:38,257 --> 01:52:46,701
About 37% of students are arriving by car, whether that's driving themselves or getting dropped off in some sort of family vehicle.

1007
01:52:47,121 --> 01:52:52,543
There's fewer of those in the morning than in the, sorry, fewer in the afternoon than in the morning.

1008
01:52:53,424 --> 01:52:56,045
So more kids are getting dropped off in the morning.

1009
01:52:57,177 --> 01:53:04,440
About 22% of students walk or bike, but that number goes up dramatically if you're within a mile of school.

1010
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:09,763
About 62% of students that close do exercise to get to school.

1011
01:53:10,463 --> 01:53:17,927
And then the vast majority of students, especially those living further away, are getting to school on either school bus or MBTA bus.

1012
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:25,507
On the next slide, you can see there's really a lot of service, especially of MBTA buses close to the site.

1013
01:53:26,287 --> 01:53:33,229
And then these buses actually come onto the site, as you well know, and something we've been looking at and are curious to hear more about in terms of operation.

1014
01:53:34,069 --> 01:53:36,290
There is one dedicated bus route in

1015
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:42,313
in North Medford that does provide direct access in a school bus to the high school site.

1016
01:53:42,973 --> 01:53:45,294
But it's a really well-served site.

1017
01:53:45,834 --> 01:53:52,898
There's also a number of routes where students are taking routes through the fells, especially from the neighborhoods immediately adjacent to school.

1018
01:53:53,478 --> 01:53:57,540
So we know that those walking routes, whether they're formal or informal, are pretty important.

1019
01:53:58,841 --> 01:54:04,563
On the next slide, you can see just a little bit more information that we've been looking at around the site

1020
01:54:06,413 --> 01:54:30,473
program essentially, and especially the idea that a huge part of the site is dedicated to that vehicular circulation and existing parking, about 476 spaces on site now, both in consolidated lots as well as scattered around the perimeter of the school and used informally around that service access which circumnavigates the school.

1021
01:54:31,433 --> 01:54:40,095
Um, big picture, there are some barriers to access, so it's difficult to access the site on foot from the neighborhoods to the north and to the west because of fencing.

1022
01:54:41,076 --> 01:54:49,798
Um, and there, you know, are some significant existing conditions where service, um, and that primary access to the pool are behind the main school building.

1023
01:54:49,818 --> 01:54:54,039
So you really do have to navigate significant portions of the service access to get there.

1024
01:54:55,480 --> 01:55:08,628
We are working with a traffic consultant to do some more capacity analysis on the existing parking and are glad to hear some comments from you all about how how much that's utilized and how much parking is really part of the demand for the future of the school.

1025
01:55:09,329 --> 01:55:15,833
On the next slide you'll see just a couple of summary points and we know there's a lot of text here but what we did is work to

1026
01:55:17,353 --> 01:55:22,955
summarize what you said to us last time in the meeting and to a couple of clear priorities.

1027
01:55:23,615 --> 01:55:45,700
So there was a lot of commentary about ensuring that the future campus is legible, it's easy to navigate, that there are safe pedestrian routes, they're well lit, they're accessible, that emergency egress and gathering areas really are obvious and intuitive and really clear for fire and police and EMS to use.

1028
01:55:47,103 --> 01:55:49,224
that there's some hierarchy of pathways.

1029
01:55:49,824 --> 01:55:53,585
Pedestrian, bike, and vehicles are separated really clearly.

1030
01:55:54,425 --> 01:56:05,808
And then there are some good connections to the Fells trails, specifically to allow access for the community into those, but to do so in a way that doesn't degrade the landscape of the Fells.

1031
01:56:05,848 --> 01:56:13,170
So really providing really clear access points so that there are fewer towpaths through the Fells as it sits adjacent to the campus.

1032
01:56:14,508 --> 01:56:23,836
So we want to pause here on the next slide, thinking really specifically about circulation and kind of moving to and through the site.

1033
01:56:24,496 --> 01:56:39,649
Is there anything big that we missed hearing last time, burning things that you didn't get a chance to share, that haven't been reflected back here, or that would be useful to discuss tonight before we talk about program and physical site?

1034
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:45,438
Thank you.

1035
01:56:45,478 --> 01:56:46,639
I thought that was wonderful.

1036
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:54,364
Um, I, I'm super encouraged to hear this with the 62% within a mile.

1037
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:58,786
I'm just curious, like, are you bumping walking Mike with that?

1038
01:56:58,826 --> 01:57:00,087
Or do you have a breakdown?

1039
01:57:00,107 --> 01:57:07,672
I just, I think I have this perception that nobody rides their bike to the high school and I would love to know if I'm wrong.

1040
01:57:09,163 --> 01:57:10,443
Do you have a breakdown?

1041
01:57:10,983 --> 01:57:12,964
That data came from Safe Routes to School.

1042
01:57:13,304 --> 01:57:15,444
And that was a survey that was done last year.

1043
01:57:15,624 --> 01:57:18,205
And it was provided to the design team by Medford.

1044
01:57:20,605 --> 01:57:25,366
The number of data points collected do not represent the entire school body.

1045
01:57:25,486 --> 01:57:28,466
So not every student responded to the survey is what that means.

1046
01:57:29,066 --> 01:57:37,228
So they are making some assumptions based on who did respond to the survey and applying those to the rest of the school group.

1047
01:57:38,008 --> 01:57:38,628
Does that make sense?

1048
01:57:39,376 --> 01:57:47,581
So it's accurate within some degree of assumptions.

1049
01:57:48,522 --> 01:57:49,362
Do you have any more?

1050
01:57:49,883 --> 01:57:50,103
Yeah.

1051
01:57:51,544 --> 01:57:58,348
If there's a way to get more information on that, we really would be thrilled to have more data.

1052
01:57:58,368 --> 01:58:02,131
She's asking if the Planning and Sustainability Office has more information on it.

1053
01:58:03,211 --> 01:58:05,693
And so this is Alicia Hunt.

1054
01:58:06,433 --> 01:58:07,374
We don't have data.

1055
01:58:07,936 --> 01:58:16,498
what I know is that there is a student, a teacher working with a student group that's trying to actively promote walking and biking to school.

1056
01:58:17,098 --> 01:58:22,819
And I'll name him Mr. Christie in the robotic shop is working on that effort.

1057
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:26,080
And he's actually asked me to advise him on it.

1058
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:29,420
So we're hopeful that we might be able to help increase it.

1059
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:37,422
But a lot of what we've heard from students outside of his effort, but on the city side is concerns about safety

1060
01:58:37,872 --> 01:58:39,812
which is why there are bike lanes now.

1061
01:58:40,533 --> 01:58:46,714
There are problems with the bike lanes and people driving in the bike lanes, even when it doesn't appear to be necessary.

1062
01:58:46,734 --> 01:58:50,535
So it's a very perplexing situation.

1063
01:58:50,555 --> 01:59:04,518
And I think that it needs some on the grounds grassroots efforts to help motivate that, to help do that with the goal that by the time this building opens, we would have more walking and biking.

1064
01:59:05,318 --> 01:59:06,438
But I don't think we can avoid

1065
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:10,743
you know, not designing for the cars because, you know.

1066
01:59:12,364 --> 01:59:14,706
Yeah, I think my question was even more basic than that.

1067
01:59:14,786 --> 01:59:20,571
It's like 60% gay, but is that like 61% black and 1% gay?

1068
01:59:20,631 --> 01:59:22,192
Do we have any more data?

1069
01:59:22,212 --> 01:59:33,822
I would say, you know, anecdotally that there are probably, there are more kids that bike in the next months because we see the bike racks full and we get asked for more bike racks during the months.

1070
01:59:34,122 --> 01:59:34,963
And it's been sort of a,

1071
01:59:36,123 --> 01:59:41,245
who can, where, how are we going to pay for them type of situation going on.

1072
01:59:41,485 --> 01:59:46,867
And now it's sort of like, how much does it make sense with this new building?

1073
01:59:46,907 --> 01:59:50,528
But honestly, I personally think it would be short money to install some.

1074
01:59:51,208 --> 01:59:56,410
And we may even have some at DPW, although I'm not speaking for DPW, who I assume is on the call.

1075
01:59:57,330 --> 01:59:58,351
I think I saw it too.

1076
01:59:58,851 --> 01:59:59,131
Yeah.

1077
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:05,333
So I actually had a separate thing that I just, I kind of wanted to flag, and I heard you saying this about

1078
02:00:07,196 --> 02:00:11,698
through the woods and accessibility and a walking loop and stuff like that.

1079
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:26,027
But I just sort of wanted to flag that the One Mile Mustang loop is something that I understand is heavily used by different student groups and cross-country and stuff like that during the year.

1080
02:00:26,367 --> 02:00:31,910
It's also something that was sort of laid out and designed by students with teacher support.

1081
02:00:32,932 --> 02:00:35,353
And so there's a lot of sentimentality around that.

1082
02:00:35,434 --> 02:00:38,755
And if any changes are gonna be made, they should be really thoughtful.

1083
02:00:39,176 --> 02:00:43,058
Like the bridge that goes through the wetland area was built by students.

1084
02:00:43,678 --> 02:00:51,202
Possibly, I think that that was an Eagle Scout project, but I know it was permitted through my office in the last 12 years or so.

1085
02:00:56,305 --> 02:00:59,787
Right, eventually post stating what I know of it.

1086
02:01:00,307 --> 02:01:01,668
But I just wanted to flag that,

1087
02:01:02,806 --> 02:01:10,630
There might make sense for changes, but there's a lot of sentimentality attached to that, so it should be really thoughtful if there are any changes.

1088
02:01:12,791 --> 02:01:17,373
I just want to circle back to the bike sort of percentage.

1089
02:01:17,413 --> 02:01:22,336
I'm wondering if we might drag Marta into sort of trying to find some more current data.

1090
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:27,638
If we could leverage maybe the advisory meetings in the morning just to get every student.

1091
02:01:27,938 --> 02:01:30,960
They don't have to identify names or anything like that, but just to indicate

1092
02:01:31,465 --> 02:01:32,565
how they're getting to school.

1093
02:01:32,585 --> 02:01:48,490
I think that would give us the granular understanding of walking versus biking, but it will also sort of get a higher percentage of deviation or assumptions that we don't have to rely on that we could hopefully get the entire student body and then maybe also do it with staff at the same time.

1094
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:56,112
And it could be a really low time investment that we just take five minutes of one advisory one day and just try to get that data together.

1095
02:01:56,132 --> 02:01:59,253
When you see electric scooters, even this time,

1096
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:00,611
Can we use that as an option?

1097
02:02:00,791 --> 02:02:04,554
Yeah, no, I think.

1098
02:02:04,674 --> 02:02:08,918
Yeah, if there's anything else.

1099
02:02:10,139 --> 02:02:12,962
And bus, right?

1100
02:02:13,222 --> 02:02:19,628
And I think we should break it out to like school bus, MBTA bus or special education bus transport, right?

1101
02:02:20,128 --> 02:02:24,272
That's another delineation that I don't think we had in there, Kate, previously.

1102
02:02:25,843 --> 02:02:29,984
Yeah, the data I think from Safe Routes to Schools doesn't distinguish, Matt.

1103
02:02:31,205 --> 02:02:37,447
I would just add that I think there's value also in understanding if students aren't biking or walking, why they're not.

1104
02:02:37,627 --> 02:02:38,987
I think someone raised that.

1105
02:02:39,027 --> 02:02:40,448
It's an interesting question.

1106
02:02:40,728 --> 02:02:47,010
Is it lack of provision of bike facilities on campus, or is it the network getting to school that's limiting

1107
02:02:47,848 --> 02:02:55,653
kids because I think the design response and planning response on the part of the city and the design team can be nuanced depending on what those answers are.

1108
02:02:55,673 --> 02:03:04,720
Okay, so maybe what we'll do is we can put together like a one pager and give it to Martha so she doesn't have to like come up with the document herself and then circulate it around.

1109
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:11,745
It's obvious from your data that people do different things in the morning and the afternoon and possibly seasonally as well.

1110
02:03:13,217 --> 02:03:19,402
Okay, so we might run our little survey past this group as well, just to get the collective benefit of everyone's wisdom.

1111
02:03:19,742 --> 02:03:25,046
It's probably helpful to know that kids take the bus in the morning and a parent picks them up in the afternoon.

1112
02:03:25,667 --> 02:03:26,608
Yep, so we have two columns.

1113
02:03:27,128 --> 02:03:28,069
Nick, do you want to go?

1114
02:03:28,129 --> 02:03:33,513
The majority of the students on the bus train, we only have one yellow bus, do you think?

1115
02:03:34,154 --> 02:03:35,275
One yellow bus?

1116
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:35,755
Yes.

1117
02:03:44,754 --> 02:03:46,896
I will think, think, think, think, think.

1118
02:03:46,996 --> 02:03:55,202
I will be thinking about the people that bite the ground up.

1119
02:03:59,085 --> 02:04:03,849
Matt, I'm just flagging, it's very difficult for those of us online to hear anybody but you.

1120
02:04:05,931 --> 02:04:09,613
I'm sorry for that, but if you could repeat, that would be really helpful.

1121
02:04:10,094 --> 02:04:12,015
I'll let Nick finish and then I'll recap what he says.

1122
02:04:12,035 --> 02:04:12,816
Okay, thank you.

1123
02:04:14,242 --> 02:04:14,922
Sorry about that.

1124
02:04:14,942 --> 02:04:15,623
I know you're good.

1125
02:04:16,803 --> 02:04:21,586
As we are thinking about students that bike and all that.

1126
02:04:22,286 --> 02:04:36,193
Also, I'm thinking just from a personal anecdotal way, I have a power chair.

1127
02:04:36,553 --> 02:04:40,835
And in the midsummer, I may want to take my power chair to school.

1128
02:04:43,532 --> 02:04:47,034
especially if it's a bigger building like this.

1129
02:04:50,436 --> 02:04:54,199
So I'm thinking about sidewalk safety.

1130
02:04:54,239 --> 02:05:09,588
I'm thinking about is there space on the sidewalk for me to safely navigate, get around not only the school compound, but around town.

1131
02:05:13,692 --> 02:05:22,717
Obviously, on a city level, that's a much bigger thing, which does not apply here.

1132
02:05:22,737 --> 02:05:34,703
But I'm thinking about, like, if I want to have lunch outside with my friends, or if I want to just take a lap around the school campus.

1133
02:05:36,183 --> 02:05:40,345
Those are also big things to be considered

1134
02:05:44,525 --> 02:05:51,847
Also, walkability and mobility are on the trail.

1135
02:05:54,728 --> 02:06:05,650
I know I went to Gordon College and a big thing up there is being outside on the trail.

1136
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:08,971
But even though I know that

1137
02:06:09,406 --> 02:06:19,671
they made at least one of the trails at least somewhat accessible.

1138
02:06:19,691 --> 02:06:23,793
I never went because I know history.

1139
02:06:23,833 --> 02:06:37,499
So it's good to have that in mind so that from the jump, you can be able to tell your disabled students that, hey, this trail

1140
02:06:38,474 --> 02:06:40,015
is actually accessible.

1141
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:43,436
You can do whatever you need.

1142
02:06:43,776 --> 02:06:49,418
All right.

1143
02:06:49,778 --> 02:07:01,563
So for Kate and everyone else, I think just to summarize, I think Nick was focused on the wheelchair accessibility and general accessibility of the site.

1144
02:07:02,463 --> 02:07:06,285
Certainly beyond the site is a consideration, but that's a larger topic

1145
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:09,531
then the project can grapple with.

1146
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:25,703
But on the site specifically, we really need to be thinking about sort of what is it like in terms of actually moving across the site from an accessibility perspective, whether it's a manual wheelchair or a powered wheelchair up to the site and around the site itself.

1147
02:07:26,539 --> 02:07:48,868
And then the interesting topic also of the trails and finding ways to make them more accessible in terms of both, probably the surfacing, and this is me sort of adding some commentary, but like the physical surface of the trail itself, but also sort of the grading of the trail as it runs around to make sure that it is viable and accessible for everybody.

1148
02:07:48,888 --> 02:07:50,529
Yeah.

1149
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:55,291
I think to tell somebody before they get on the trail is that they can

1150
02:07:56,218 --> 02:08:01,059
get around because they will assume they can't if they don't see the sign.

1151
02:08:02,019 --> 02:08:04,159
Did you hear that piece on signage, Kate?

1152
02:08:04,279 --> 02:08:12,421
Yeah, the need to flag that the Fells trails require certain things.

1153
02:08:14,001 --> 02:08:18,062
Well, yeah, just the fact that if it's an accessible trail, it needs to be marked at the beginning.

1154
02:08:18,102 --> 02:08:23,883
And when you're going down a non-accessible trail, that should also be clear as you intersect with anything else.

1155
02:08:24,563 --> 02:08:24,703
Yeah.

1156
02:08:25,834 --> 02:08:26,454
Thank you, Craig.

1157
02:08:26,474 --> 02:08:34,359
When it comes to site access, right, it blew me away at the last meeting when somebody said, hey, I got to drive up that hill on a bike and I get to the top of the hill and I'm winded.

1158
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:46,587
Now, if you are in a wheelchair, right, if you get off on Winthrop Street, you know, if the school is going to be put where the field is now, that's like a quarter of a mile.

1159
02:08:47,388 --> 02:08:49,789
Or if it's going to be put in the front parking lot or renovate.

1160
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:54,152
Either way, just the start of it, of getting up the hill,

1161
02:08:55,293 --> 02:08:57,674
is right, you know, the first priority.

1162
02:08:57,754 --> 02:09:00,435
Do you go up, go, you know what I mean?

1163
02:09:00,455 --> 02:09:01,875
Do you have stairs or whatever?

1164
02:09:02,256 --> 02:09:05,797
But that was, you know, because I've been working up here a long, long time.

1165
02:09:06,377 --> 02:09:15,380
And we've always, you know, we've made facilities adjustments to try to help people that in wheelchairs like she is.

1166
02:09:15,821 --> 02:09:24,124
But that particular thing blew me away because it's something that I never even thought of as far as like, you know, because I've always been building base.

1167
02:09:27,403 --> 02:09:32,069
So I don't, I'm sorry, I'm going to note that Matt Galluzzi has his hand up.

1168
02:09:32,329 --> 02:09:34,072
I don't know how many people can see.

1169
02:09:35,594 --> 02:09:37,756
Go ahead, Matt.

1170
02:09:37,776 --> 02:09:42,082
We'll move on right after Matt's comment, just because we want to make sure we have time to capture things.

1171
02:09:42,142 --> 02:09:43,443
And we can always circle back at the end.

1172
02:09:44,353 --> 02:09:44,993
Thanks, everybody.

1173
02:09:45,233 --> 02:09:54,137
Just to speak a little on the trails, because I actually, I'm the guy who wrote the DCR grant when we put in the Feltloop trail.

1174
02:09:54,618 --> 02:09:59,180
There is a separate program that DCR offers for accessibility.

1175
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,161
separate program.

1176
02:10:01,181 --> 02:10:02,621
We looked into some of it.

1177
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:08,005
The problem that we encounter, if you've ever been on the Mustang loop, it's a lot of wetlands.

1178
02:10:08,465 --> 02:10:12,367
There's vernal pools and it's very soggy ground.

1179
02:10:13,168 --> 02:10:14,008
We have a lot of rain.

1180
02:10:14,048 --> 02:10:14,929
We have a lot of snow.

1181
02:10:15,329 --> 02:10:20,752
So it's very difficult to incorporate into the actual Mustang loop trail.

1182
02:10:20,952 --> 02:10:21,813
And if you actually look

1183
02:10:22,433 --> 02:10:34,097
where we had one of the trailheads on the Mustang Loop Trail, we've since kind of moved it a little, because coming down by that entrance by the vocational school, we get some rain, we get some snow, and it's three, four inches of mud.

1184
02:10:34,717 --> 02:10:45,261
So there would have to be some serious site work done, and I don't know how the DCR is with us bringing in, you know, other products into the Fells to make it more accessible, but

1185
02:10:46,121 --> 02:10:51,244
I can look into the grant program on accessibility and report back.

1186
02:10:51,885 --> 02:10:53,166
You know, I'm more than happy to do so.

1187
02:10:53,226 --> 02:10:54,807
I think everyone should be able to use it.

1188
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:57,788
So I think that would be helpful.

1189
02:10:58,769 --> 02:11:01,251
All right.

1190
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:02,732
Thank you.

1191
02:11:02,892 --> 02:11:04,573
So I was going to bring that up.

1192
02:11:04,613 --> 02:11:06,834
It's like so that that it's our neighbor, right?

1193
02:11:06,854 --> 02:11:07,354
Our partner.

1194
02:11:07,394 --> 02:11:08,415
And this is DCR.

1195
02:11:08,475 --> 02:11:12,878
And we have to have some conversations with them to understand sort of what the improvements are.

1196
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:31,451
I mean, sometimes when we see wetlands in that type of scenario, like an acceptable approach is to put in some type of elevated boardwalk that doesn't actually modify the hydrology as you go through and that's been acceptable, but there's obviously costs there and that would be construction outside of our site perimeter.

1197
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:42,796
So all these things, we're not gonna be able to solve them all today, but it's actually amazing to like hear about them today and start to sort of formulate this list and things that we're gonna investigate as we move forward.

1198
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:48,674
All right, so I'm going to push us forward, Kate, if you want to go into the next section.

1199
02:11:49,095 --> 02:11:49,415
Sure.

1200
02:11:49,515 --> 02:11:52,697
So the next section is about programming and operations.

1201
02:11:52,777 --> 02:12:01,985
You all had shared some really great feedback with us about site amenities and the desire for this to be kind of a Medford destination that brings community and high school together.

1202
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:04,950
The truth is it already does that exactly.

1203
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:14,096
This is a high school, but the demographics of the site are much deeper than just 14 to 18 year olds and staff serving them.

1204
02:12:14,937 --> 02:12:23,102
So I think you all know this, it's almost 1200 total students, pretty diverse population reflecting the diversity of Medford, about 130

1205
02:12:24,323 --> 02:12:28,286
teachers coming to school, teachers and staff coming to school every day.

1206
02:12:29,566 --> 02:12:44,136
But bigger picture than that, because of the popularity of the pool and the fields at Edgerly Field, roughly a quarter of Medford residents report that they visit this campus 10 times a year or more.

1207
02:12:44,176 --> 02:12:52,121
And so that's well beyond the population of students and families that might be coming for regular school and school events.

1208
02:12:53,272 --> 02:12:59,596
The other thing that the site currently houses is the preschool program, and that, you know, could well expand.

1209
02:12:59,796 --> 02:13:08,861
And so you do have families of much younger children, as well as younger children on site every day, and sort of their needs being met on this site.

1210
02:13:09,902 --> 02:13:19,067
Beyond that, also the trails and the parking for trails really being a regional destination and a way to access the Fells throughout the weekends as well.

1211
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:34,120
So on the next slide, you'll see just big picture how to- Just to interrupt really quick, just on the preschoolers, so just for everyone's collective understanding, the Medford Early Education Program, that preschool program is not currently located onsite at the building.

1212
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:40,523
That is a program that's being considered to be consolidating early education here moving forward.

1213
02:13:40,543 --> 02:13:41,844
So that is definitely part of the plan.

1214
02:13:41,864 --> 02:13:47,808
The preschoolers that are here right now are probably through the Medford Family Network Program,

1215
02:13:48,903 --> 02:13:53,666
or the kids corner daycare, which is a little bit younger in terms of the student population.

1216
02:13:53,686 --> 02:13:59,991
So there definitely is a population here on site, but we're gonna be bringing more of those younger students here moving forward.

1217
02:14:00,011 --> 02:14:01,952
I just wanted to clarify that for folks.

1218
02:14:02,532 --> 02:14:03,213
Thanks so much, Matt.

1219
02:14:03,313 --> 02:14:04,754
Yep, that's a great clarification.

1220
02:14:04,774 --> 02:14:06,955
Sorry, Nick has one quick question.

1221
02:14:12,959 --> 02:14:13,860
Perfectly okay, yes.

1222
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:14,400
Yeah, you're good.

1223
02:14:16,401 --> 02:14:17,082
Sorry, Kate, keep going.

1224
02:14:17,566 --> 02:14:21,448
OK, we couldn't hear the question, so hopefully we didn't need to respond.

1225
02:14:22,869 --> 02:14:30,353
So just big picture, I think one of the things that we've been doing is categorizing the different types of programs that are currently on site.

1226
02:14:30,853 --> 02:14:36,776
And at a squint, I think you can see that about 50% of the site is gray, as we discussed before.

1227
02:14:36,896 --> 02:14:38,797
It's school roof and parking.

1228
02:14:39,757 --> 02:14:43,999
And the majority of the rest of the space are edgerly field and the practice field.

1229
02:14:44,039 --> 02:14:45,980
Those are big space users on site.

1230
02:14:46,801 --> 02:14:52,223
Smaller programs kind of around the building immediately adjacent are highlighted in yellows and reds here.

1231
02:14:52,904 --> 02:14:58,786
These are smaller gathering areas, older plazas, paved areas that were part of the original 1960s plan.

1232
02:15:00,737 --> 02:15:04,359
and then the areas in red are the existing preschool play areas.

1233
02:15:05,719 --> 02:15:13,502
Some of the areas facing the fells are the CTE yards and currently used for kind of outdoor program and storage as well.

1234
02:15:14,483 --> 02:15:27,528
Big picture I think you know there's an opportunity to better integrate these spaces and kind of the daily life of the school as well as improve the overall condition and care of the spaces which you know have

1235
02:15:28,308 --> 02:15:32,312
been durable for a long, many decades, but are reaching the end of their life.

1236
02:15:32,913 --> 02:15:36,737
You all expressed quite a lot of good thinking about this last time we were together.

1237
02:15:36,757 --> 02:15:38,178
On the next slide,

1238
02:15:39,052 --> 02:15:53,978
We did do a little digging in terms of the city planning that has gone on, you know, has been undertaken in the past just to see if there were any amenities that the city has talked about in the past locating at the high school site in the future.

1239
02:15:54,758 --> 02:16:07,743
We didn't find as much of that as we thought we might, but there are some great goals for the high school site in some of the recent planning about stabilizing bank, addressing erosion, addressing, you know, climate resilience,

1240
02:16:09,024 --> 02:16:14,428
And, you know, diversifying the character and use of the space to welcome more community members.

1241
02:16:14,528 --> 02:16:21,855
So I think on the next slide, you'll see that we've reflected back some of what we heard from you all about what that diversity could look like.

1242
02:16:22,415 --> 02:16:24,457
There were a lot of great comments last time.

1243
02:16:25,237 --> 02:16:35,622
especially in the written feedback about dedicated outdoor classrooms, about using the site as an outdoor laboratory for the CTE and the science programs, especially with its adjacency to the Fells.

1244
02:16:36,842 --> 02:16:45,046
There were some great comments about hosting more community events and field days and joint programming between the Friends of the Fells and the high school.

1245
02:16:46,266 --> 02:16:52,809
And then some of these comments, which align with the town planning documents about prioritizing climate resilience,

1246
02:16:53,572 --> 02:17:07,316
and providing some buffer space between the more high-intensity uses, like athletic fields and parking, and the fells, which is a naturally more kind of quiet, introverted space for reflection and outdoor recreation.

1247
02:17:08,456 --> 02:17:13,718
So we're curious, again, for you all to share, you know, what did we miss?

1248
02:17:13,878 --> 02:17:22,560
What other opportunities and challenges are there related to the program, amenities on site, and any operational concerns about those amenities?

1249
02:17:23,447 --> 02:17:37,137
specifically, I think, would love to hear about any desired program for the site that isn't currently hosted on site or an expansion of any of that program that is that we should really be focused on as part of the design process aspirationally.

1250
02:17:37,957 --> 02:17:41,540
Jenny, I see your hand, so I'd love to go there first, if that's okay, Matt.

1251
02:17:44,302 --> 02:17:45,062
Thanks.

1252
02:17:45,843 --> 02:17:46,063
You know,

1253
02:17:46,583 --> 02:18:05,485
A couple of the things that we have talked about as we've been navigating through this process is increasing the number of athletic teams that can be supported on the site versus having to travel elsewhere in the community.

1254
02:18:05,965 --> 02:18:06,165
Yeah.

1255
02:18:06,566 --> 02:18:20,857
And specifically our football team and our track teams, they have to go clear across the city without rail transportation, I don't think, to get to their field.

1256
02:18:20,897 --> 02:18:25,620
And I think for practical reasons, what that translates to for the football team is they don't.

1257
02:18:26,161 --> 02:18:30,684
And they practice on this wonky, dirty practice field.

1258
02:18:30,704 --> 02:18:31,125
Yes.

1259
02:18:31,766 --> 02:18:37,684
Um, and so I'm, I'm hugely interested in figuring out how can our site support.

1260
02:18:38,592 --> 02:18:48,297
not just maintaining the two soccer lacrosse fields, but also, can we pull the stadium onto this site?

1261
02:18:49,838 --> 02:18:50,878
And what would that take?

1262
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:59,763
And then the other thing I think about is our softball team and our baseball teams, those spaces are at a premium in Medford, too.

1263
02:18:59,783 --> 02:19:05,126
I think the baseball team plays at Playstead, which is

1264
02:19:06,007 --> 02:19:11,689
fairly accessible, but I don't think I actually know off the top of my head where the softball team plays.

1265
02:19:12,449 --> 02:19:15,951
But I think it's not a walkable place.

1266
02:19:17,991 --> 02:19:33,017
So I think when I think about all the athletics teams and what we're providing for, the site, as big as it is, doesn't really provide for athletics.

1267
02:19:33,865 --> 02:19:50,041
And I think there's huge community interest in seeing our athletics teams grow and be more successful because I think the community really understands that that's part of belonging and feeling like you're part of something.

1268
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:50,121
But.

1269
02:19:53,144 --> 02:20:00,046
The, the site does hinder that we don't talk about that so much, but the site does hinder that kind of activity as well.

1270
02:20:00,166 --> 02:20:14,511
So, like, if you ask me, like, very all the parking under every playing field that you can jam onto the space so that we can have more more kids with more access, because those create barriers, especially to the kids who.

1271
02:20:15,994 --> 02:20:19,116
are not transported to and from school by parents.

1272
02:20:19,336 --> 02:20:23,820
And it just, it makes it harder for students to participate.

1273
02:20:23,860 --> 02:20:32,145
And I feel like the students that we're disadvantaging are high needs students, which is the exact opposite of what we should be trying to do.

1274
02:20:33,907 --> 02:20:34,407
Thanks, Jenny.

1275
02:20:34,527 --> 02:20:35,848
Yeah, really well taken.

1276
02:20:36,646 --> 02:20:37,947
Nicole I see your hand as well.

1277
02:20:38,947 --> 02:20:41,809
Hi, so I'm a softball in a baseball mom.

1278
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:51,494
And yeah so baseball is a place said like member Graham said walkable for the boys but they also have equipment.

1279
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:53,851
And so that's tough.

1280
02:20:54,271 --> 02:21:02,735
And obviously, you know, the later the day gets or the colder the weather is, especially at the start, you know, my son's on the baseball team now.

1281
02:21:03,636 --> 02:21:07,558
And so practice is in the cages there at the high school.

1282
02:21:08,519 --> 02:21:11,360
But that does get moved outside and it's not on campus.

1283
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:14,682
And even practicing on Thursdays, they go for a run.

1284
02:21:15,602 --> 02:21:20,207
But it's, you know, down the hill and up, you know, and I know that the track team is doing that too.

1285
02:21:20,807 --> 02:21:33,659
The softball girls, my daughter just graduated Mefford High, as I can say, last year now, because we're in 2026, but their practice field and where they play is all the way across Mefford.

1286
02:21:33,699 --> 02:21:36,141
It's in South Mefford at the Columbus Park.

1287
02:21:37,082 --> 02:21:46,636
So it is as far as you can get from high school, literally, literally the opposite side, you know, to go from west to south.

1288
02:21:46,916 --> 02:21:50,701
And so I know the challenges as a working mom, you know.

1289
02:21:52,468 --> 02:21:55,809
those years that she was on the team that we couldn't drive her.

1290
02:21:55,829 --> 02:22:04,271
It was like at the mercy of other parents who could or she didn't go, you know, or it was a grandmother or an aunt or whoever that, you know, could pitch in for a day.

1291
02:22:04,411 --> 02:22:14,734
And it does, it gives kids a huge disadvantage that can't get there because there's usually is not enough time to say, well, hop on the bus and go.

1292
02:22:14,754 --> 02:22:14,834
Yeah.

1293
02:22:15,914 --> 02:22:24,060
That's not even, you know, and so a lot of the kids are also doing that if they can, but that's not always realistic either.

1294
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:28,203
So, but yeah, so the girls softball straight across the other side of the city.

1295
02:22:28,243 --> 02:22:29,324
So just wanted to throw that out there.

1296
02:22:29,704 --> 02:22:39,512
But yes, I agree with everything member Graham said about trying to get stuff to stay at school because it opens up a huge door for so many more of our students.

1297
02:22:39,652 --> 02:22:40,592
So thank you.

1298
02:22:41,173 --> 02:22:42,314
Yeah, really appreciate that.

1299
02:22:42,354 --> 02:22:42,634
Thank you.

1300
02:22:43,124 --> 02:22:47,825
At some point, it would be helpful to talk with athletics about which things can share space seasonally.

1301
02:22:48,546 --> 02:22:52,067
So I think we're open to that conversation when you all are ready to share.

1302
02:22:53,707 --> 02:22:54,888
Matt, are there folks in the room?

1303
02:22:55,368 --> 02:22:57,348
I don't see any other hands up online at the moment.

1304
02:22:57,368 --> 02:22:58,249
Alicia.

1305
02:22:58,869 --> 02:23:12,553
I have one other thing that hasn't been mentioned at all, that over the years, we've been asking students to work on gardening, like being able to do food gardening.

1306
02:23:13,054 --> 02:23:20,999
And so you may have seen in the inner courtyard, they have gardens and they try to plant trees where you can eat the fruits and stuff.

1307
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:33,046
If there's a way to support that effort, planting apple trees and pear trees and having student clubs that take care of them and take the fruit and serve them in the cafeterias or hand them out to the kids or whatever.

1308
02:23:33,786 --> 02:23:40,871
But thinking about edible landscapes, I think it's both supports what we've been hearing from the students over the past 15 years.

1309
02:23:42,096 --> 02:23:47,319
as I've been doing this and provides a great example for the public.

1310
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:49,781
Yeah, thank you.

1311
02:23:49,801 --> 02:23:50,381
Appreciate that.

1312
02:23:50,401 --> 02:23:51,622
It's a great program idea.

1313
02:23:51,662 --> 02:24:00,228
I think one of the notoriously challenging things about school gardens is sort of the primary sort of tending season is when nobody is here.

1314
02:24:00,308 --> 02:24:09,133
So I think as we go down that road, what we want to do is find community groups that are willing to work with the school to make sure that those are maintenance during.

1315
02:24:09,214 --> 02:24:11,375
That's really the key to making sure that those things work.

1316
02:24:11,647 --> 02:24:15,388
The key to that is actually the design of the school and the footprint.

1317
02:24:15,668 --> 02:24:26,312
Because where the garden made sense for them to put it in the inner courtyard that the general public can't just access during the summer without special permissions or special arrangements.

1318
02:24:26,752 --> 02:24:30,773
So thinking about how and where you structure these things.

1319
02:24:31,413 --> 02:24:39,216
And just in those lines, I love the idea that kids should be able to eat outside at lunchtime when the weather allows or during their breaks or whatever.

1320
02:24:39,838 --> 02:24:56,969
I don't know where things stand right now, but over the years, there have been issues with all the classrooms looking down on the courtyard and it echoing and causing problems for teachers who want to open their windows and the kids in the courtyard, just normal talking is overwhelming.

1321
02:24:57,069 --> 02:25:01,432
So just floating that out there, that's a building design issue that I'm hoping.

1322
02:25:02,433 --> 02:25:06,956
We have heard that and we definitely have heard this desire for outdoor dining in other venues.

1323
02:25:08,037 --> 02:25:08,517
That's great.

1324
02:25:09,657 --> 02:25:10,417
Teresa.

1325
02:25:10,597 --> 02:25:12,898
So I have two things.

1326
02:25:13,118 --> 02:25:18,740
One is an easy question and then the second is a question slash comment.

1327
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,541
The easy one is, is the idea that Bedford Family Network will stay?

1328
02:25:24,242 --> 02:25:24,482
Yes.

1329
02:25:24,562 --> 02:25:24,962
Okay.

1330
02:25:25,062 --> 02:25:25,862
Yep.

1331
02:25:26,142 --> 02:25:27,383
Brilliant.

1332
02:25:27,503 --> 02:25:27,903
100% yes.

1333
02:25:28,043 --> 02:25:38,326
And then I, this is something I've just been thinking about since our last meeting was I have

1334
02:25:39,002 --> 02:25:41,824
It's always bothered me that the high school is up on the hill.

1335
02:25:42,045 --> 02:25:51,672
And when we talk about opening it up to the city of Ventura, that to me in my mind has been key and a big interest of mine in participating in this process.

1336
02:25:52,473 --> 02:26:07,465
And I forget who it was at the last meeting that was talking about the hillside and the expense associated with grading it down to make it more accessible, which make it easier to walk and bike and be on mobility device and all of that.

1337
02:26:09,258 --> 02:26:14,099
As I've been in the area, I've been thinking about the other challenges as well.

1338
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:17,020
And I was hoping that you could just spend a minute talking about them.

1339
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:25,203
Because you've got the celebration of the veterans that are, there's a memorial that's right there.

1340
02:26:26,183 --> 02:26:29,844
And then you've got the Temple Shalom with Camp Six Acres.

1341
02:26:30,064 --> 02:26:36,306
And then you've got some properties that are just like, what is the site coming from Winter Street?

1342
02:26:37,717 --> 02:26:39,338
are you on a flagship lot?

1343
02:26:39,379 --> 02:26:45,563
Like do you, how much access do you have to increase your presence right on Winthrop?

1344
02:26:47,164 --> 02:26:52,547
So I don't know, Kate, whether we have a slide that shows the property line, maybe a little bit clearer here.

1345
02:26:52,567 --> 02:26:55,930
It's tough for us to read on screen here.

1346
02:26:56,890 --> 02:26:58,171
It's definitely an excellent question.

1347
02:26:58,291 --> 02:27:06,657
It's not one that I'm 100% sure we'll be able to touch on today, but we can certainly wrap that into

1348
02:27:07,415 --> 02:27:24,169
topics that we talk about moving forward and sort of give maybe a very enlarged version of sort of that drive up to show the property lines what we have and sort of who the exact neighbors are in terms of the role from Winthrop Street up to the building to understand that.

1349
02:27:24,910 --> 02:27:32,156
And then certainly that question of elevation difference is something that we should talk to as a group as well, because it's there is

1350
02:27:33,945 --> 02:27:38,828
sort of large scope implications in terms of making any modification to that.

1351
02:27:39,189 --> 02:27:49,056
Definitely some potential benefits there, but also it would bring in some challenges, not just on the cost side, but also in terms of just the environmental impact side, in terms of doing some major land forming.

1352
02:27:49,076 --> 02:28:00,264
It's not that it's impossible, because it's not, because we've done it recently in some other locations nearby, but it's definitely a sort of a big topic and definitely worthy of some discussion here for sure.

1353
02:28:01,024 --> 02:28:03,146
Let's see, I think Kate has a slide

1354
02:28:04,111 --> 02:28:08,154
couple of slides ahead of this where we will talk about the elevation.

1355
02:28:08,654 --> 02:28:13,097
But just for the property boundaries, it is very narrow along that street.

1356
02:28:13,818 --> 02:28:19,462
And the Fells actually kind of owns a piece of land in between those houses and the school.

1357
02:28:19,722 --> 02:28:27,667
And so it's very tight to the existing footprint of the site and what's being used.

1358
02:28:27,847 --> 02:28:28,188
So yeah.

1359
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:36,378
Amanda online has her hand up if that's possible to go there.

1360
02:28:37,019 --> 02:28:42,713
Alright, we do one more question and then I think maybe we we push forward into the last piece, but we can always again circle back if we have time.

1361
02:28:44,402 --> 02:28:45,062
Thanks so much.

1362
02:28:45,302 --> 02:28:49,344
This is low priority, I think, in the scheme of some of the other things that have come up.

1363
02:28:49,444 --> 02:28:52,345
But just because I haven't heard it, I figured I'd throw it out.

1364
02:28:53,085 --> 02:29:11,351
As a learning environment could be a great opportunity, you know, if we're including things like green infrastructure on the site to have interpretive signage or other types of ways to invite both students and community members in to understand the site design.

1365
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:14,654
just feels like a cool opportunity.

1366
02:29:15,855 --> 02:29:16,255
That's all.

1367
02:29:17,697 --> 02:29:18,277
Absolutely.

1368
02:29:18,457 --> 02:29:19,758
Yeah, really hear you there.

1369
02:29:19,798 --> 02:29:26,324
And as Matt said in the beginning, we've divided your comments into these three categories, but they're all intersecting.

1370
02:29:26,845 --> 02:29:35,473
And that's a great example of the way in which the physical site and the ecology can also be a program amenity that is tied to curriculum.

1371
02:29:35,573 --> 02:29:37,615
So really appreciate that comment, Amanda.

1372
02:29:38,315 --> 02:29:42,277
So that's a great transition to our last category, the physical site.

1373
02:29:43,077 --> 02:29:54,243
So you all shared a lot of kind of love for the fells in both this conversation and last, and that idea of integrating the two is really powerful and a great opportunity here.

1374
02:29:54,783 --> 02:29:59,265
We know the fells to be a really rich landscape with a lot of diverse species.

1375
02:29:59,365 --> 02:30:02,727
It's one of the largest conserved areas of land in the region.

1376
02:30:03,627 --> 02:30:08,470
and provides habitat for a wide variety of really unique New England species.

1377
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:18,475
It's also because of the level of disturbance, especially around the perimeter of the high school site, it's home of several invasive species.

1378
02:30:19,245 --> 02:30:30,913
that are difficult to control that are on, you know, DCR's radar is something that I'd like to control more in the fells, but also at the sort of border between more developed areas like the high school and the fells.

1379
02:30:31,433 --> 02:30:38,758
So these are in evidence kind of all around the site perimeter as you make it into the sort of deeper, more conserved areas of the fells.

1380
02:30:39,658 --> 02:30:45,402
So a lot of opportunity to learn about stewardship, Amanda, both from a stormwater perspective, but also from

1381
02:30:45,802 --> 02:30:49,127
an ecology and a native species perspective.

1382
02:30:49,687 --> 02:30:53,813
On the next slide, you'll see just how much the fells really hug this site.

1383
02:30:53,953 --> 02:30:57,077
It's a site that's been carved out of the fells, essentially.

1384
02:30:58,507 --> 02:31:07,534
And you can see the way that forested environment surrounds the site really on four sides and how narrow that throat is of access along Winthrop Street.

1385
02:31:08,875 --> 02:31:22,524
You also know this from your experiences in the fells, but that significant bedrock outcropping and the landscape of like the bedrock being exposed that is pervasive throughout the fells is also in existence on this site.

1386
02:31:22,604 --> 02:31:23,185
So there are

1387
02:31:23,625 --> 02:31:31,369
bedrock outcrops that are visible on site, both at the perimeter, but also in areas kind of around the fields and in between the fields.

1388
02:31:32,049 --> 02:31:34,670
So we know bedrock is not far beneath the surface.

1389
02:31:34,750 --> 02:31:44,095
The site team is doing some investigations now and we'll learn more about what lies below what you can see, but we are sure that there is plenty of bedrock sitting there.

1390
02:31:44,815 --> 02:31:51,939
On the next slide, you can see just a rough approximation of how much grade the site is challenged to navigate.

1391
02:31:51,959 --> 02:31:58,122
There's a series of several different plateaus that were carved out when the high school was built in the 1960s.

1392
02:31:58,162 --> 02:32:08,028
That was an era of big landscape movement and not a lot of worry about moving ecological features and topography.

1393
02:32:08,748 --> 02:32:16,773
So they carved out a series of plateaus, arranged those as pretty flat spaces, and have a series of pretty steep grades in between.

1394
02:32:16,873 --> 02:32:29,299
Some retaining walls, but really a lot of kind of one-to-one slopes that have been eroding with stormwater management issues for quite some time now.

1395
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:33,542
So there really is, you know, about 80 feet, the series of plateaus.

1396
02:32:34,102 --> 02:32:37,184
And as Matt said, the opportunity to think about how we work with

1397
02:32:38,204 --> 02:32:47,351
that existing landscape as well as, you know, strategic areas where we modify those existing grades as we move forward.

1398
02:32:48,072 --> 02:32:52,635
On the last slide, just a little bit of context about what you all had shared previously.

1399
02:32:53,915 --> 02:33:10,228
As Amanda said, a lot of kind of aspirational thinking about designing with the site, locating the buildings, as Matt said, where it makes most sense from topography and drainage and environmental constraints, while also providing some room to be really smart about where buildings and programs should go.

1400
02:33:11,509 --> 02:33:16,353
You all talked last time about a continuous band of protected space that really might

1401
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:24,656
start to address the invasive species and better bridge between the more developed areas of the high school and the more natural areas of the fells.

1402
02:33:25,496 --> 02:33:38,966
Restoring that natural hydrology was important and thinking about stormwater management that is both reflective of the values of the school and Medford and good for the fells and Medford's environment and water quality.

1403
02:33:39,426 --> 02:33:40,167
And then finally,

1404
02:33:41,479 --> 02:33:55,727
These opportunities to share stewardship goals, as Matt said, to think about how students are leveraged for trail building, for stewardship, for learning about the habitat and the native environment of the fells as part of the educational program of the school.

1405
02:33:56,807 --> 02:34:00,970
So with that said, just one more opportunity to really think about the physical site.

1406
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:07,253
We are curious, again, what we've missed, what challenges and opportunities do you think we really need to capitalize on?

1407
02:34:07,964 --> 02:34:14,291
And are there any other kind of big hazards or things that we should know about as we think about the physical site?

1408
02:34:18,756 --> 02:34:27,966
It's safe to say that you guys already know about the fact that there's been flooding issues with the water coming in out of the cell through the building.

1409
02:34:28,247 --> 02:34:28,447
Okay.

1410
02:34:28,793 --> 02:34:32,755
I figured because John's sitting here, you probably know that, but I figured we should say it.

1411
02:34:32,875 --> 02:34:49,042
So yes, but I have no issue with anyone saying it over and over again, just to make sure that everyone out there is aware that this is happening, because it is a huge challenge right now in the building, and something that we have to definitely be paying attention to as we're thinking about any new construction, for sure.

1412
02:34:50,442 --> 02:34:51,303
Or renovation, sorry.

1413
02:35:00,066 --> 02:35:05,009
I'm going to start talking obviously about it.

1414
02:35:07,591 --> 02:35:14,915
We are going to make an outdoor classroom underneath the lab.

1415
02:35:16,036 --> 02:35:18,978
Make sure that the spaces are accessible.

1416
02:35:19,498 --> 02:35:27,683
Because you don't want to have a class when you have a disabled student.

1417
02:35:28,711 --> 02:35:34,115
Oh, yeah, you can get out there.

1418
02:35:34,335 --> 02:35:45,944
So Kate and everyone, I'm not sure if you heard Nick, but the comment was about the accessibility of outdoor classrooms to make sure that they're being designed with sort of universal design in mind.

1419
02:35:46,865 --> 02:35:50,828
And we can't have outdoor spaces that are accessible only to the able-bodied.

1420
02:35:51,509 --> 02:35:53,190
Yeah, absolutely.

1421
02:35:53,330 --> 02:35:54,411
We fully agree, Nick.

1422
02:35:55,151 --> 02:35:55,452
And so

1423
02:35:56,077 --> 02:36:10,240
You know, that's a real challenge on a site with 80 feet of grade change, but certainly both a requirement of ADA code and a priority of the design team to ensure universal access to gathering spaces, no matter where they are on site.

1424
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:14,481
So really appreciate that and get ready for some creative solutions to navigate all that grade.

1425
02:36:14,501 --> 02:36:24,764
Just getting back to why we're here is security purposes, keeping the kids safe in our classes, keeping the kids safe when they walk about.

1426
02:36:25,845 --> 02:36:31,029
keeping, you know what I mean, not being intrusive, but keeping people safe.

1427
02:36:34,011 --> 02:36:35,372
I couldn't hear that one either.

1428
02:36:35,432 --> 02:36:37,193
Matt, could you share that?

1429
02:36:37,734 --> 02:36:39,455
Yeah, no, it's so that was from John.

1430
02:36:39,475 --> 02:36:45,380
And really, it's the circling back on the topic that we're here about safety as one of our primary goals.

1431
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:51,284
And it's safety when we're moving around the building, when we're outside of the building in the fells as well.

1432
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:59,384
We have to sort of use that lens when we're thinking about whatever sort of design interventions we're going to propose from a site perspective.

1433
02:37:01,426 --> 02:37:02,026
Yeah, thank you.

1434
02:37:02,046 --> 02:37:05,688
I don't know if we have anybody else online.

1435
02:37:05,708 --> 02:37:07,749
Hands up.

1436
02:37:08,249 --> 02:37:09,610
No one else with a hand up right now.

1437
02:37:11,351 --> 02:37:11,411
OK.

1438
02:37:11,431 --> 02:37:16,214
We can shift forward then.

1439
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:18,930
Yep, there's.

1440
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:30,332
There's two versions of this, so any last comments and then I know that Laura wanted to talk construction logistics and make sure that we have time for that too.

1441
02:37:30,392 --> 02:37:34,353
I'm just seeing a comment from Ethan about adding a mountain bike pump track.

1442
02:37:35,353 --> 02:37:38,373
Love that Ethan will make sure that makes it into the notes.

1443
02:37:41,594 --> 02:37:41,834
Alright.

1444
02:37:43,454 --> 02:37:44,014
So again, we can.

1445
02:37:44,054 --> 02:37:47,035
We can circle back on this if people have some thoughts that form,

1446
02:37:47,834 --> 02:37:52,137
We want to talk about the most exciting aspect, which is construction site safety.

1447
02:37:53,517 --> 02:37:56,879
It'll be the most exciting in a couple of months in front of us here.

1448
02:37:58,761 --> 02:37:58,961
Yes.

1449
02:37:59,021 --> 02:38:17,432
Well, especially after you see the options and start to really imagine what could be happening on this site after our presentation tomorrow, you'll get to hear about things like phasing and the fact that there'll be active construction next to active school buildings

1450
02:38:18,277 --> 02:38:24,042
And so there'll be different ways of separating this construction activity from the school activities.

1451
02:38:25,783 --> 02:38:35,710
Things like scaffolding will give access to roofs and the mechanical and like roof maintenance that needs to happen there.

1452
02:38:36,451 --> 02:38:40,894
There'll be emergency access maintained during construction.

1453
02:38:40,954 --> 02:38:46,899
But as you can see from that top photo, sometimes that is a gravel road as

1454
02:38:47,352 --> 02:38:54,136
pavement is taken up and we need to shift where that access happens.

1455
02:38:55,317 --> 02:39:00,440
One of the biggest things you'll see was a lot of fencing around the active worksite.

1456
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:12,548
So wherever that construction is going on, there will be a fence around it to keep people out and to keep all of the people in.

1457
02:39:12,568 --> 02:39:12,748
A lot of

1458
02:39:16,569 --> 02:39:24,971
the ways that you can manage these different shifting active zones of construction is to have very clear temporary signage.

1459
02:39:25,692 --> 02:39:32,894
You need to see big arrows pointing to where the buses need to go, where drop-off is happening, where the pedestrian routes are.

1460
02:39:34,094 --> 02:39:43,377
And so this will create these safe, well-marked paths for users while all this is happening.

1461
02:39:46,268 --> 02:39:58,555
Once more options are narrowed down and we have a better idea of what the different parts of the sites are that will be touched, of course, that's when the real logistics happen.

1462
02:39:58,875 --> 02:40:05,539
And you'll see by the end an actual sort of like a plan, a map of like, this is what we're going to touch first.

1463
02:40:06,259 --> 02:40:10,601
And this is where the people will park and where access will be.

1464
02:40:10,741 --> 02:40:13,763
And then this is going to be the next phase and things will shift.

1465
02:40:14,512 --> 02:40:21,661
But until we can develop options, we can't really lay out a plan like that.

1466
02:40:21,721 --> 02:40:27,468
But that's the end goal for this construction logistics.

1467
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:38,448
I think I might add, Laura, just the fact that the author of those logistics plans is really someone that is not part of the team yet, which is going to be the construction manager that comes on board.

1468
02:40:38,889 --> 02:40:44,894
We can certainly do a credible job of sort of trying to understand what some of the costs might be for that in advance.

1469
02:40:44,934 --> 02:40:54,442
But in terms of actually doing all these things that Laura is talking about, the construction managers are the ones that they are the professionals there in terms of laying it out.

1470
02:40:55,230 --> 02:41:09,139
to understand and convey to the entire community, staff, students, the larger community coming in to still use the resources that are live, how the whole thing will shift and evolve and morph over time, because it won't just be one construction logistics scenario.

1471
02:41:09,219 --> 02:41:16,804
It's going to change as we go through the process, depending on the number of phases and the durations and all these things that will come into play later.

1472
02:41:17,458 --> 02:41:20,920
This is a little bit more of a preview that we're sharing with everyone.

1473
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:31,425
And once the construction manager comes on board, or even as part of that selection process, there will be a lot of inquiring as to thoughts there and processes as to how to make that go safe.

1474
02:41:31,485 --> 02:41:43,631
But safety is the absolute paramount consideration when we're talking about construction logistics on site, because it is a tricky population to make sure it is safe, right?

1475
02:41:43,651 --> 02:41:44,872
But we have to protect them.

1476
02:41:45,333 --> 02:41:48,237
from themselves sometimes in terms of everyone moving around.

1477
02:41:48,958 --> 02:41:54,265
And that's really what the primary goal and outcome has to be.

1478
02:41:55,667 --> 02:42:00,012
So I don't know if we have- Matt, we have, Nicole has her hand up.

1479
02:42:00,974 --> 02:42:01,695
Sure, go ahead, Nicole.

1480
02:42:02,312 --> 02:42:10,820
So just one thing I was thinking about yesterday when we were preparing for this meeting is where are the construction vehicles and, you know, just people coming to do the construction going to park?

1481
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:16,124
Just, you know, I know we said it was 476 spots now on a regular day.

1482
02:42:16,164 --> 02:42:18,146
That doesn't seem like enough spots.

1483
02:42:18,667 --> 02:42:22,310
So I just can't imagine all of these crews here, you know,

1484
02:42:23,918 --> 02:42:31,044
taking up spots, teachers trying to park, you know, just the loop and I'm a mom that's dropping off every morning.

1485
02:42:31,084 --> 02:42:48,798
So just thinking of all of that happening and sitting in that traffic with, you know, construction vehicles and just, you know, not even the vehicles, but just the people coming to work on the construction itself, just as a thought of like, will they have a, maybe like a satellite spot to park or, you know, just to throw that in,

1486
02:42:50,283 --> 02:43:04,350
as just a thought moving forward is that, you know, with probably less space for parking with construction going on and construction workers coming, how, you know, just logistically where everybody would be parking.

1487
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:05,190
So just a thought.

1488
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:09,312
Yeah, that is certainly one of those considerations.

1489
02:43:09,392 --> 02:43:19,077
Like you mentioned, the satellite lot is seen or used pretty often in a dense urban environment where you don't have a lot of excess site to work with.

1490
02:43:20,173 --> 02:43:27,278
They need to manage their parking with their lay down space with sort of all the other things that consume site area.

1491
02:43:27,859 --> 02:43:34,103
And so it's certainly something that they are expert and need to sort of weigh in on.

1492
02:43:34,123 --> 02:43:40,848
So we'll have to review that with them as they come on to the project team, whoever it ends up being.

1493
02:43:41,408 --> 02:43:41,788
Thank you.

1494
02:44:08,908 --> 02:44:09,909
Yeah.

1495
02:44:10,109 --> 02:44:16,932
So the question for folks online is how much of the school construction is going to be done during the school year and sort of timing of the day?

1496
02:44:16,972 --> 02:44:25,517
And probably the answer there is that it's going to have to be done while school is in session, probably the entirety of a couple of years.

1497
02:44:26,617 --> 02:44:36,823
So it's going to be the process of moving things around, establishing those safe sort of fencing lines in terms of where people are active and sort of coming and going.

1498
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:45,166
There's going to be no way to schedule things so that like construction only happens off hours or on weekends or during summer.

1499
02:44:45,206 --> 02:44:58,477
Certainly they will use those opportunities where they are doing particularly noising activities or particularly disruptive activities to try to limit those to during sort of off hours from school.

1500
02:44:59,117 --> 02:45:02,320
And there'll be a lot of coordination of that with the school schedule.

1501
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:05,811
but there's no way of avoiding it in terms of it going through.

1502
02:45:05,831 --> 02:45:08,752
So that's, it's going to be something that has to be managed.

1503
02:45:08,832 --> 02:45:18,574
And for those of you that are remote, I know that Marta, like when we started bringing up this particular topic, I could see the angst on her face trying to imagine all these things going on.

1504
02:45:19,415 --> 02:45:30,798
But all of this will be done in very, very close collaboration with the school administration to be able to make sure that it's clear to everyone what's happening and that there's something completely objectionable

1505
02:45:31,462 --> 02:45:37,765
that we find ways of working around that, whether it's MCAS days or other sort of quiet periods that need to be maintained.

1506
02:45:40,026 --> 02:45:40,246
Yes.

1507
02:46:07,183 --> 02:46:28,973
So again, for folks online, the consideration that we just want to keep in mind is that we have to maintain accessibility during the entire course of construction, that we can't create inaccessible conditions at sort of those interim phases as we go.

1508
02:46:29,768 --> 02:46:35,250
So that has to be wrapped into sort of the operational planning, the logistical planning as we go forward.

1509
02:46:36,330 --> 02:46:39,331
It's a good point.

1510
02:46:39,811 --> 02:46:40,591
Other folks online?

1511
02:46:41,972 --> 02:46:42,692
Anyone has hands up?

1512
02:46:45,933 --> 02:46:47,153
There's a question in the text.

1513
02:46:47,573 --> 02:46:47,813
Okay.

1514
02:46:48,313 --> 02:46:50,514
Where will students have classes during construction?

1515
02:46:52,397 --> 02:46:53,858
That is a great question as well.

1516
02:46:54,279 --> 02:47:18,900
One that we don't know the answer to, but it will be some mixture of students having classes in pieces of the building that are remaining on site while construction is ongoing, and I fully appreciate the fact that there's a lot of variables there that we just are not have the ability to sort of fully answer just yet, but I can almost guarantee at some point there's going to be construction going on and there's going to be classes going on.

1517
02:47:19,332 --> 02:47:20,293
in the existing building.

1518
02:47:20,313 --> 02:47:30,200
There's also the potential of us using what are called temporary modular classroom buildings that are brought to the site as basically temporary classroom space that's going to be located somewhere.

1519
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:35,604
Again, we have no idea where that might be just yet or if it's going to be part of the mix, but it could be in there.

1520
02:47:35,624 --> 02:47:42,649
So there could be students in temporary buildings at the same time as the existing building at the same time as construction is going on.

1521
02:47:42,729 --> 02:47:46,972
So those are all sort of the things that we're going to be sorting out as we go forward here.

1522
02:47:48,434 --> 02:48:00,956
I think that part of the space study is studying each interim phase so that there will be classroom space for all the programs, even as, you know, renovation and addition happens.

1523
02:48:01,817 --> 02:48:08,658
So we have to we have to manage academic classroom counts in terms of making sure there's enough space for those classes to go on.

1524
02:48:08,678 --> 02:48:13,199
We also have to make sure that CTE programs have shop spaces to go to somewhere.

1525
02:48:13,219 --> 02:48:15,039
And those are specialized spaces.

1526
02:48:15,717 --> 02:48:18,960
that are more challenging to do temporary versions of as we go forward.

1527
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:22,203
And then there's all sort of the specialized support spaces.

1528
02:48:22,303 --> 02:48:33,392
And we're going to have, again, close conversations with the district and with the school administration to understand are there some of those spaces that we can't live without during the course of construction?

1529
02:48:34,073 --> 02:48:39,998
Are there some spaces that we can make flexible use of other spaces or resources on site?

1530
02:48:40,458 --> 02:48:42,340
The same thing could be said for fields, right?

1531
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:49,794
whether or not we have field access ongoing across the duration of construction is something we just don't know yet as we go through it.

1532
02:48:50,174 --> 02:48:55,438
There's going to be an intense pressure on every inch of the site in terms of utilization.

1533
02:48:56,138 --> 02:48:59,600
So we have to balance and juggle all those things as we go through, but it's not good.

1534
02:48:59,640 --> 02:49:04,744
Those decisions don't get made in isolation and they don't get made by the contractor exclusively.

1535
02:49:04,784 --> 02:49:11,768
They get made as part of a collective project city team discussion and decision.

1536
02:49:20,137 --> 02:49:22,558
Again, it's going to be a couple of obvious things.

1537
02:49:22,638 --> 02:49:39,384
With that, I don't know if you can see, but a number of things have been done.

1538
02:49:41,065 --> 02:49:47,807
First, the emergency routes, and there are also some things to be very careful about.

1539
02:49:50,900 --> 02:50:00,968
You don't want to have some type of emergency, and then you only have this purpose, particular way, and then you leave it out.

1540
02:50:01,429 --> 02:50:03,550
Oh, wait, you can get out this way.

1541
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:05,172
Ah, okay.

1542
02:50:05,992 --> 02:50:18,923
So, again, the comment is really thinking about emergency planning and access as well, and during the course of construction, making sure that we're thinking about how to get people

1543
02:50:19,614 --> 02:50:25,677
safely I think probably out of the building and out of the site in terms of overall considerations.

1544
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:43,306
All right so I think we may be good with that topic and again I'm just going to spend a couple minutes here forecasting where we're going and again if then there's any other final comments or

1545
02:50:43,685 --> 02:50:45,525
Topics that people wanted to circle back with.

1546
02:50:45,565 --> 02:50:49,786
We do have a couple minutes remaining, but we can also adjourn slightly early.

1547
02:50:51,287 --> 02:50:56,428
So our third meeting is going to be coming on March 11th.

1548
02:50:57,628 --> 02:50:59,109
I mean, I think the timing, yeah, so 530.

1549
02:50:59,149 --> 02:51:02,849
We will be doing it as a hybrid approach.

1550
02:51:02,869 --> 02:51:04,290
I think there's been some value here.

1551
02:51:04,410 --> 02:51:07,911
We'll figure out our owl issues and we'll get some video working again.

1552
02:51:09,031 --> 02:51:13,532
But I think there's been enough of a success here that I think having hybrid is valuable.

1553
02:51:15,206 --> 02:51:27,023
And as we go forward, our next meeting is really going to look to create specific line item recommendations that can be forwarded to the building committee for inclusion in the project.

1554
02:51:27,083 --> 02:51:31,329
And really, we're talking about cost considerations, I think, at this early juncture more than anything.

1555
02:51:32,363 --> 02:51:41,228
And we'll categorize those into like a traffic light organization, which are green things that are given that everyone just agrees must be included in the project moving forward.

1556
02:51:41,248 --> 02:51:45,850
We don't really need to talk about it as a group, but it will be there as a recommendation going to the Billing Committee.

1557
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:55,716
We're going to talk about flashing yellow items that are things that we talked about that there may be differing opinions on as to whether or not we're including them or doing some of these things.

1558
02:51:56,416 --> 02:51:59,838
And so those will actually have a conversation at this next meeting upcoming.

1559
02:52:00,831 --> 02:52:08,674
And there may also be red light items, right, that are just deemed to be by this group, probably not attainable, viable to be included in the project.

1560
02:52:08,734 --> 02:52:13,356
And we want to sort of go on record as well that there was some discussion, there was some collective decision.

1561
02:52:13,396 --> 02:52:15,356
And again, it's a recommendation to the building committee.

1562
02:52:15,857 --> 02:52:20,478
The building committee could always disagree with those types of things and try to push things into a different category.

1563
02:52:20,518 --> 02:52:25,140
But generally this process of letting the advisory team sort of the experts in each area

1564
02:52:25,887 --> 02:52:34,955
come up with these sets of recommendations and then give them to the building committee, it's a good way of tapping into the expertise that we have collectively in each individual area.

1565
02:52:35,796 --> 02:52:42,201
We know the choices to renovate or do full construction before these recommendations

1566
02:52:42,805 --> 02:52:43,685
forward?

1567
02:52:43,825 --> 02:52:59,089
So I don't know if we're going to have the 100% decision as to there, but we're definitely going to have some actual tangible options that are on the table that we can sort of look through the lens of every advisory team to say, what do we think about like this option versus the other option?

1568
02:52:59,229 --> 02:53:02,589
And we can weigh in potentially as part of the process going forward.

1569
02:53:03,090 --> 02:53:09,211
Ultimately, that selection is going to come from the building committee in terms of whether it's new construction or addition renovation.

1570
02:53:10,307 --> 02:53:13,650
But we can certainly provide guidance as part of the advisory team.

1571
02:53:14,691 --> 02:53:15,051
Sure.

1572
02:53:15,151 --> 02:53:17,374
Yep.

1573
02:53:17,394 --> 02:53:19,496
Yep.

1574
02:53:21,097 --> 02:53:22,298
We can categorize as we go.

1575
02:53:22,619 --> 02:53:26,843
I think the other thing just maybe the point out and we'll go back to the other advisory team.

1576
02:53:26,863 --> 02:53:28,785
We'll try to get those sent out.

1577
02:53:29,443 --> 02:53:33,446
in advance so people can think about them and consider them prior to coming to the meeting.

1578
02:53:33,466 --> 02:53:39,070
Because I think that will make it a little bit more efficient for everybody to have a good conversation and just get consensus.

1579
02:53:39,090 --> 02:53:46,176
Because that's what we want coming out of that third meeting is consensus so that we can push those recommendations up to the building committee.

1580
02:53:48,697 --> 02:53:49,598
All right, John.

1581
02:53:49,878 --> 02:53:57,424
So when I look at an F at high school in general, I don't look at it as the public's entrance into the fells.

1582
02:53:57,504 --> 02:53:58,485
It's not to me

1583
02:53:59,216 --> 02:54:01,377
where the public goes to the fells.

1584
02:54:01,458 --> 02:54:09,223
So right now at this point, we have dog walkers, we have track walkers, we have people that come in, park in the parking lot and go into the fells.

1585
02:54:09,843 --> 02:54:14,286
If that on the security aspect does concern me, you know what I mean?

1586
02:54:14,386 --> 02:54:18,789
I know we want everybody to use it, but we are not an entrance to the fells.

1587
02:54:19,049 --> 02:54:23,392
So I think that somehow or another, that has to be put forward security aspect.

1588
02:54:25,366 --> 02:54:29,209
So I think that's a great topic because I think I've heard like different perspectives of that here.

1589
02:54:29,249 --> 02:54:35,694
And I think what we need to do is sort of come up with a collective recommendation because there's different viewpoints.

1590
02:54:35,774 --> 02:54:40,999
And I think we need to just listen to sort of the logic behind each of them and then figure out, okay, what does that mean?

1591
02:54:41,039 --> 02:54:45,422
Like, how are we proceeding with that as a project team?

1592
02:54:45,722 --> 02:54:54,429
One thing to think about with that is, and how do we, maybe the city needs to bring this up with DCS more, but the reason people park here a lot,

1593
02:54:54,907 --> 02:54:58,848
is that the bells don't really have parking lots.

1594
02:54:59,209 --> 02:55:00,449
And when they do, they're small.

1595
02:55:01,089 --> 02:55:04,751
And Medford residents don't like people parking on their streets.

1596
02:55:05,291 --> 02:55:09,472
And so there are a lot of the streets along the bells are resident parking permit only.

1597
02:55:09,873 --> 02:55:19,416
And I can tell you as a member of the traffic commission, that the reason that exists is because people who live on those streets petition to have their streets made permit parking only.

1598
02:55:19,856 --> 02:55:24,238
And I think that's sort of, it's useful to have it elevated that it's a problem,

1599
02:55:24,818 --> 02:55:26,719
And that we should be thinking about that.

1600
02:55:26,799 --> 02:55:34,721
And should people be able to just petition to have Governor's Ave up near the Fells, permit parking only.

1601
02:55:34,781 --> 02:55:37,522
The only reason people park up there is to go to the Fells.

1602
02:55:39,343 --> 02:55:42,264
Yeah, it happens all over, all by the Mystic Lakes as well.

1603
02:55:42,444 --> 02:55:44,545
So roads are all permit parking.

1604
02:55:44,625 --> 02:55:47,886
It's okay, we need some spicy topics.

1605
02:55:47,906 --> 02:55:48,406
Thank you, Joan.

1606
02:55:54,408 --> 02:55:57,130
I mean, you're also a citizen, sir.

1607
02:55:57,270 --> 02:56:09,601
As you mentioned, higher public schools are a lot of alumni, and there are certain situations where you get to comfortably from here.

1608
02:56:10,962 --> 02:56:23,032
Like, if you go on the bells, there's probably certain places that people want to get you on the bells, but they only know from this background.

1609
02:56:25,823 --> 02:56:38,946
And so, while it may not be a public entrance, you have a whole bunch of other guys that know that the felons come from this group.

1610
02:56:40,086 --> 02:56:42,526
And so, there's all those out there as well.

1611
02:56:44,206 --> 02:56:49,887
Depends on how you look at it, because the fact that, like you guys, you all have to sign in with a badge.

1612
02:56:49,927 --> 02:56:52,568
These people are coming on our campus and they don't have badges.

1613
02:56:53,495 --> 02:56:57,697
You know, so there's, you know, you don't know who they are.

1614
02:56:58,258 --> 02:57:01,119
You have to be careful and you have to be safe.

1615
02:57:01,239 --> 02:57:06,802
But I think there's also a matter of the fells.

1616
02:57:07,062 --> 02:57:12,005
I don't know the reason, but at least it's a democratic party.

1617
02:57:12,885 --> 02:57:18,468
Definitely, it's a flashing yellow item that we're going to talk about as we go forward.

1618
02:57:18,808 --> 02:57:21,630
I think that's definitely warrant some discussion.

1619
02:57:23,653 --> 02:57:24,013
Thank you.

1620
02:57:24,033 --> 02:57:28,934
I guess there's no one else online I assume that has their hand up at this point.

1621
02:57:31,415 --> 02:57:33,495
All right, so we'll give everyone two minutes back.

1622
02:57:34,075 --> 02:57:36,456
And again, thank you everyone for participation.

1623
02:57:37,036 --> 02:57:40,177
This is really wonderful and appreciate everybody's perspective and time.

1624
02:57:40,197 --> 02:57:43,558
Thanks all.

1625
02:57:44,218 --> 02:57:44,518
Bye-bye.
