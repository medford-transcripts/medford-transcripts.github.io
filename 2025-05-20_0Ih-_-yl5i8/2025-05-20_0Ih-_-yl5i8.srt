00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh.

00:17:56,107 --> 00:18:04,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Today we are covering item 25-069 offered by me chair Callahan.

00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a resolution to invite the friends of the

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli chair Callahan present.

12
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:26,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

13
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So to start us off, I will just read the resolution first.

14
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:47,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the Chevrolet theater is a historic thriving cultural center used by our residents, which brings together people from all over Greater Boston, be it resolved that the city council invite Cindy Watson from the friends of the Chevrolet to attend a public works and facilities meeting to inform our community about the state of the Chevrolet theater.

15
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would love to invite Ms.

16
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:55,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Watson to come up to the podium and give us your

17
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us your take on the State of the Chevalier.

18
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, let me just... Hello?

19
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:07,594
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, you're on.

20
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:07,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

21
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,456
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, thank you for inviting me to the meeting.

22
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:16,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And Anna did yeoman's efforts to make sure that this took place at five o'clock.

23
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for spearheading the meeting.

24
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:19,923
[SPEAKER_06]: My pleasure.

25
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:23,026
[SPEAKER_06]: The rate of the pack is determined by the speed of the leader.

26
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being the leader.

27
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we go into what I want to talk about, I also want to thank some of the council members for coming to the Friends of Chevalier meeting.

28
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:44,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a standing room only, as well as those who have chosen to become members.

29
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

30
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:52,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here representing the Friends, which is near and dear to my heart, but I'm also a commissioner.

31
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So this addresses tuitions, okay?

32
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:02,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I work closely with Paul Donato, all right?

33
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: As we know, I was shocked.

34
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to some people down at City Hall last week.

35
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:10,284
[SPEAKER_06]: They had no clue who Paul Donato was.

36
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,526
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that he's a state rep from Medford, all right?

37
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:21,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So he and I touch base often because every year he raises $100,000.

38
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,507
[SPEAKER_06]: for the Chevalier.

39
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:32,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this year, you know, we talk often, he's the Vice President of Friends of Chevalier.

40
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:41,415
[SPEAKER_06]: He indicated that he went before the House and Ways and Means Committee down at the State House to ask for $150,000 as opposed to $75,000.

41
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

42
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:54,963
[SPEAKER_06]: They were very upset because there was no documentation from the previous year of the $100,000 that he gave us.

43
00:20:56,404 --> 00:21:01,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years ago, we almost lost the money because we didn't spend it by June 30th.

44
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Fortunately, we were able to spend the money at that time.

45
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told Paul that I would take care of it.

46
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I went down to City Hall.

47
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:16,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the opportunity and the pleasure, I had never met him, to meet with Bob Dickinson.

48
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:26,607
[SPEAKER_06]: the CFO, I asked him to tell me, these are funds earmarked specifically for the Chevalier.

49
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:38,017
[SPEAKER_06]: He looked into, I went into his room, the computer, right now there's only $25,000 in the fund, all right?

50
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is May 20th.

51
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, this money is running out.

52
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:48,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mentioned it at the commission meeting on Wednesday.

53
00:21:49,641 --> 00:22:02,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now there was a contentious battle somewhat between myself and Paul Riggi, who's the facilities director who oversees 18 facilities.

54
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,175
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot for one person.

55
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:15,875
[SPEAKER_06]: However, he also indicated that he's responsible for the fiscal aspect of the buildings, which why do we have a financial director?

56
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:22,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So the meeting ended at approximately, let's say eight o'clock, that's at six o'clock.

57
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:33,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I just left Wednesday with $25,000 in the account as advised by Bob Dickinson.

58
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:39,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I had also emailed Brianna, the mayor, about this as well.

59
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:49,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, on Thursday morning, I wake up, 7.19, I get a message.

60
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:59,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's the budget for all of a sudden, from Friday night to that morning.

61
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:04,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Increased emergency lighting, $14,000.

62
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Increased, excuse me, replaced antiquated emergency lighting, $18,922.

63
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:19,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Paid to the exterior, doors to the theater, as well as the handrails and the fire escape, $27,935.

64
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Replaced a non-functional handicapped door opener,

65
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:36,699
[SPEAKER_06]: at $8,850 and made other improvements for the accessibility to the theater at a rate of $36,579.

66
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't believe these are accurate figures.

67
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,563
[SPEAKER_06]: That very next morning, Friday, I

68
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:53,725
[SPEAKER_06]: emailed Bob Dickinson because he told me that was the best way to address the situation.

69
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,088
[SPEAKER_06]: He gets, you know, various phone calls.

70
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:04,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I also called the mayor, all right, because I don't want to present false information to anybody, all right?

71
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,358
[SPEAKER_06]: This money is earmarked for the Chevalier alone.

72
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I don't know if this council knows, we've just had our third lawsuit.

73
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I don't know if we're following the rules of indemnification or not.

74
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:27,023
[SPEAKER_06]: The woman sued because on the balcony, the lighting is very poor.

75
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:34,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's number one, why I'm here to ask for additional funds for the lighting in the balcony.

76
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:36,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is ridiculous.

77
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So where did these funds come from?

78
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:39,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are the numbers?

79
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Can anybody explain it to me?

80
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:48,069
[SPEAKER_06]: This is within a 12 hour period.

81
00:24:51,011 --> 00:25:02,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, this is just, you've just been sort of rattling off some events that happened and I don't have the budget numbers right in front of me.

82
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sure there is a budget for the Chevalier.

83
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:12,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like us to follow up with the administration to figure out what the budget is?

84
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:16,237
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be $100,000 in the arena.

85
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:17,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

86
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:17,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like $100,000.

87
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just ask the $100,000.

88
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:29,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that for this fiscal year so that that would be from last July 1 until ending in June 30.

89
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

90
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would mean that was since we're three quarters of the way through that year, that maybe there would be $25,000 left.

91
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:35,614
[SPEAKER_07]: That was all he had.

92
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he told me.

93
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:39,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

94
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounded I mean, I look, I wasn't at that conversation.

95
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:45,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm really just going off of what you said.

96
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:51,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like there are twenty five thousand dollars remaining in the budget and there is a quarter of the year left to go.

97
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:55,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So that doesn't sound particularly odd.

98
00:25:56,436 --> 00:26:09,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I don't have like I was not I did not realize if you'd asked I could have prepared and had the budget at this meeting, like with all those numbers and knowing what everything had been spent out of that budget.

99
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:14,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not realize that that was what you were going to be asking about today.

100
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:14,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So

101
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:36,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my main reason for coming here was to get additional lighting for the balcony, so that great and that that was what I understood that you had some requests of things that you wanted done which, you know, we're happy to, you know, pass along but I think if you want a deeper understanding of what's going on with the budget like we can do that it just might take a little bit of time I'm going to go to Councilor Lazzaro.

102
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:40,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

103
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,253
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

104
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:44,075
[SPEAKER_07]: You're number five?

105
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna tell.

106
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, who's requesting?

107
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:49,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get you?

108
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:49,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, yes.

109
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:59,822
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing is, if you have a request for funding, we would have to go through the mayor's office.

110
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:02,064
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor's office allocates the budget.

111
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:08,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We can only, as a council, approve or not the budget as it's presented to us from the mayor's office.

112
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:23,113
[SPEAKER_01]: our meeting at six o'clock tonight is to hear from a variety of departments that are presenting their budgets that have been allocated by the mayor's finance office.

113
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:29,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be Bob Dickinson and the mayor with input from those departments.

114
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:31,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they present them to us.

115
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:34,098
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear about why various things are changing and then

116
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: When we approve the budget in June.

117
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:45,159
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do but we don't we don't get to have very much input we do send the mayor our suggestions in earlier in the spring, but.

118
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is it is useful for us to hear about what the needs are.

119
00:27:50,469 --> 00:28:06,703
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have if we had done it slightly earlier we could have presented the mayor with some requests, but they're not always met, I sent a variety of requests to the mayor earlier in the spring, they weren't all even close to Matt because there isn't that much money available in the budget

120
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:13,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if what you're saying is that it wasn't, it was available but it wasn't spent, I think that's my understanding.

121
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,854
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, Are you sure you are not Bob.

122
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:17,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So by the way, if I may.

123
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:30,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, at six o'clock, we will have the Chevrolet theater budget on the, so if you just stick around, then you will hear the presentation of the budget for the Chevrolet theater so who's going to present that.

124
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:32,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.

125
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:37,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, also, I believe Paul Riggi is on Zoom and has raised his hand.

126
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So shall we go to him?

127
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:39,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that all right if we go to him?

128
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

129
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

130
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:41,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

131
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:43,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you?

132
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: We're asking you to unmute.

133
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

134
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm here.

135
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:53,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

136
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,192
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several things I'd like to talk about.

137
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,654
[SPEAKER_02]: One, it came to our attention.

138
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:12,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy had notified us that Representative Donato wanted an itemized detail of what we spent the money on.

139
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So the list that she just read is myself going through my records, and I keep everything for the Chevalier separate.

140
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:26,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I was able to produce that list so quickly.

141
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:39,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two is I have been working all fiscal year on the premise that we receive $100,000 earmark.

142
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was spending that money for the Chevalier Theatre based on that earmark.

143
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Through conversations that we've been having, we are just double checking with the state that the appropriation was properly transferred over to the city of Medford.

144
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:12,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Dickinson has reached out to the state controller's office to find out the exact date that the earmark was sent over and the exact amount that was sent over.

145
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on that behind the scenes just to double check that the money that representative Donato had earmarked for the Chevalier Theater was actually received by the city of Medford.

146
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:35,042
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so as you said yourself, Paul, to quote you,

147
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:44,202
[SPEAKER_06]: We could possibly be $75,000 in the hole, because I appreciate your efforts in trying to investigate where this money is.

148
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:49,727
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the commission is the one that really

149
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,414
[SPEAKER_06]: prompted me to come here.

150
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:55,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I volunteered and that's how I got in touch with them.

151
00:30:55,835 --> 00:31:00,237
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be in the hole because the state has guaranteed the city of Medford that money.

152
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just need to do the transfer.

153
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're working on to ensure that the transfer came over properly and is coded properly.

154
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It could actually be in the general account for the city and just needs to be transferred over to the special account for the Chevalier Theatre.

155
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:28,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something we're working on behind the scenes to ensure that it is done and completed properly.

156
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:39,548
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, at May 20th, I would appreciate your efforts to get that money appropriated appropriately so that Paul Donato,

157
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,204
[SPEAKER_06]: will be satisfied.

158
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have two issues, Cindy.

159
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:49,028
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we need to confirm that the state actually transferred it over.

160
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:59,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they did, then that's how we can actually check to ensure where that money is sitting in the city's treasury.

161
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,170
[SPEAKER_06]: One that's what I have been asking.

162
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

163
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And that and we're working on that.

164
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But and we're working.

165
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob did reach out to the controller.

166
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:14,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been having a conversation so that we're getting closer to the resolution of that issue.

167
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, because

168
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Donato has raised over $5 million for the Chevalier, okay?

169
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,301
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the Friends with me.

170
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, Paul, let me finish.

171
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,982
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on the Friends with me.

172
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:39,183
[SPEAKER_06]: He and two others have been on the Friends for 30 years, since the inception of the Friends.

173
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,824
[SPEAKER_06]: He deserves to know, and he is our state rep.

174
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:46,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming here as a courtesy gesture.

175
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little odd that it

176
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:53,540
[SPEAKER_06]: May 20th, a month away from the end of the year, we don't know.

177
00:32:54,321 --> 00:33:06,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I am happy for all of your efforts, and I'm grateful that at least this is being pursued, because right now the money's not there, okay?

178
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, just as an example, as the friends, okay, when we write up things, and I can just, okay, give you a snapshot,

179
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:26,685
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we, under, I can't take all credit for this at all, Ken Krause is unbelievable.

180
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:33,788
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we've, the friends have raised $1.7 million, all right?

181
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:39,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just for the Chevalier, it's also for the Medford Youth Center.

182
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:40,868
[SPEAKER_06]: the YMCA.

183
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:51,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as an example, again, we have the documentation, which I think all parties involved should have and should know how the money is being spent.

184
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We raise the money.

185
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:58,021
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get any state money, very little at times.

186
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we have people do grant writing.

187
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:06,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Committed to crafting the city's application to the Mass Gaming Commission.

188
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:23,955
[SPEAKER_06]: casino mitigation fund, resulting in grants of $300,000 to convert the Chevalier ceiling lighting to LED, it's spectacular, and to install digital billboards near the front entrances to the theater.

189
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,296
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

190
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:29,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Obtained a 10-year, again, as I alluded to,

191
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:46,597
[SPEAKER_06]: grant, a sustaining grant from the Cummings Foundation to expand a literacy program to the Medford Youth Center, building on the incentives program that has been going on for years.

192
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:53,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we have the documentation, we do the financial reports.

193
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The commission, unfortunately, does not have a secretary.

194
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So things are now recorded.

195
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have these figures.

196
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:03,807
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

197
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:12,671
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy, particularly to you, Anna, that you will continue to look up into this because we don't need another lawsuit.

198
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:16,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, when we go, I'm not an attorney.

199
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:21,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chevalier is owned by the city of Medford.

200
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:24,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's going to be sued?

201
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

202
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:37,802
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, now a second issue, and I don't know if you folks are, but something this is you can handle.

203
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:42,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I live across the street from the Heckner Center, all right?

204
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:59,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford secured $850,000 in federal funding to transform the Heckner Center into a vulnerability preparedness site and climate recreation.

205
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The place looks like something out of the Adams family.

206
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:10,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to call every year during the summer because kids are jumping the fence, going in there, doing various things.

207
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So does anybody have any idea as to when that will start?

208
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:21,198
[SPEAKER_02]: George, Anna, Adam?

209
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:23,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morocco?

210
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:27,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy, I can actually give you an update on the Heckner Center if you'd like.

211
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:28,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

212
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:29,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

213
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on that project.

214
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:40,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The city departments that want to use the center have actually provided a schematic design of the building.

215
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: and I will be meeting with our outside house doctor to meet on site so they can come up with architectural drawings for the building because that's the next step as part of our grant process to get the architectural drawings done.

216
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:05,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And once those are done, then the city can actually bid out on the construction for that Heckner Center.

217
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:09,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So there have been a lot of things going on in the background

218
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:22,244
[SPEAKER_02]: that will support actually putting a shovel in the ground and getting that turned over to what it is now re-imagined and re-envisioned as.

219
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:30,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any expectation of when this might start, because that has been sitting there in that condition for years.

220
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:35,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now they have old police cars in the parking lot.

221
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:41,579
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, the Hager Center is actually not on the agenda and I really am interested in understanding.

222
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that you would be giving us the state of the Chevrolet, and I know you specifically wanted to talk about the facility.

223
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,546
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just asked if this was something that was appropriate to bring up here.

224
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to whoever receives the federal money.

225
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: George, do you have any idea?

226
00:37:58,612 --> 00:37:59,033
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea.

227
00:37:59,193 --> 00:37:59,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

228
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:13,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have some to the chair.

229
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Representative Donato did call me about the funding.

230
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wanted to let us know just an update that they found $25,000.

231
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,482
[SPEAKER_05]: They reported to Bob Dickinson.

232
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there is $75,000 that they'll be reaching out tomorrow to make sure that the city of Medford receives that 75,000.

233
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have that 100,000.

234
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:36,305
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also asking,

235
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:50,270
[SPEAKER_05]: the state to follow back to all of the money that was required was to be sent to Medford over the last five years.

236
00:38:50,330 --> 00:39:01,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's doing even a deeper dive and hoping that if there was something that they missed that the city missed or the state missed that we can recover and hopefully help us as we move forward.

237
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:03,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to share that with you.

238
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:05,956
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great, George.

239
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:06,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

240
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that with the lighting situation, quick question, if I can through the chair.

241
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

242
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:22,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we, has anyone on the, I know that you do a lot, Cindy, I know your team does so much, but has anybody applied for community preservation money to help assist in funding?

243
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Ken has in the past.

244
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we got money elsewhere.

245
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,122
[SPEAKER_06]: This can is going to be leaving a lot of things.

246
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:30,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

247
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:44,620
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this current year, my knowledge is that nobody applied for the CPA, because we had money, like I said the $300,000 we got money from mitigation, we get a dollar

248
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,338
[SPEAKER_06]: back from every single show that's done.

249
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:53,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's two shows, okay, the maximum capacity is 1900 times two, that's $3,800.

250
00:39:54,324 --> 00:40:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So so I think what I would ask if we could motion that we could ask the city administration to see if someone from the city can assist us in

251
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:10,504
[SPEAKER_05]: writing a proposal or a wish to CPA for any funding.

252
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:12,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they have a number for the lighting?

253
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they get a number by any chance?

254
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Mr. Riggi get a number to?

255
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I respond?

256
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

257
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:20,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

258
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:30,568
[SPEAKER_02]: What I made very clear at our last commission meeting is that the lighting situation is the next item that will be addressed.

259
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: and that the new earmark that we would get would address that lighting.

260
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:46,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we get money from the state before that, based on the conversation that you had with Representative Donato,

261
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,583
[SPEAKER_02]: then that lighting would be fast-tracked even faster.

262
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:55,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So that lighting is something that I know about.

263
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,768
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost estimate was $63,000.

264
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, we've also

265
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:10,257
[SPEAKER_02]: found some other areas where we need to improve this type of lighting so the cost would actually be higher.

266
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:18,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going after a cultural grant for that and found out two weeks ago that we got denied funding for this project.

267
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Regan, I appreciate all the hard work.

268
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:27,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's very difficult to do what you're doing as a one-person army.

269
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I would still recommend moving forward.

270
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't hurt to start the process.

271
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: for possibly $100,000 CPA funding to support the historical site of Chevalier, because I think it's a public safety issue right now.

272
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:48,178
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're saying that people are suing us right now, we're losing money more than we're bringing in, so.

273
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:53,539
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not suing us, they're suing our partner, Blumenreich Productions.

274
00:41:54,739 --> 00:42:00,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But my question, nobody seemed to know, and there was an attorney there, Lenny Gliana,

275
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It, he's gonna look into it, but hopefully it appears as though the city will not have to be responsible.

276
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:14,736
[SPEAKER_06]: This Bill Boomer productions will be, but nevertheless, it's a concern.

277
00:42:14,996 --> 00:42:20,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want it some, it was some elderly woman that fell and it fractured her ankle or something.

278
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,700
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to have these types of accidents.

279
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is I still sometimes am amazed

280
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:37,891
[SPEAKER_06]: that the Chevalier Theatre under Bloom-Bloomwright's production is the economic engine for the city of Medford.

281
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you how many times the businesses, the restaurants, we only have four, basically five,

282
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:54,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's Tacuba the Ford, now we have Mrs. Murphy's, as well as Real Gusto, all right?

283
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:56,363
[SPEAKER_06]: They are thriving, all right?

284
00:42:58,003 --> 00:42:59,684
[SPEAKER_06]: They are so happy.

285
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:01,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I get phone calls all the time.

286
00:43:02,804 --> 00:43:08,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just feel like sometimes the city of Medford sees the Chevalier as a stepchild.

287
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So any efforts that you can do would be terrific.

288
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:15,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

289
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:20,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still do want to ask, aside from the lighting, it seems like the lighting is on people's radar.

290
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:28,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there other needs that you see in terms of the facilities, things that you would like to happen in the near future?

291
00:43:28,428 --> 00:43:30,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there other needs that you see in the Chevrolet?

292
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:32,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

293
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:38,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But I made a motion at the meeting at the commission to make this the number one priority.

294
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:43,201
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to speak out of turn without getting there.

295
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have a laundry list, Anna.

296
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to speak without, I mean, we're a team.

297
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:52,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I apologize.

298
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:53,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was what this meeting was about.

299
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:58,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's because we're addressing the, you know, the LED lighting.

300
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and that's what we need the money for.

301
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's correct as opposed to why I'm here, correct?

302
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like there is a motion on the floor.

303
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:07,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you maybe repeat?

304
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you catch that motion?

305
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:09,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, thank you.

306
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli moving to ask if someone from the city can assist us in writing a proposal or request to the CPA, and then you trailed off for a second.

307
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm guessing it's for funding?

308
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: for any emergency lighting.

309
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:38,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on for a second.

310
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be a lot quicker.

311
00:44:56,724 --> 00:44:56,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

312
00:44:57,805 --> 00:44:59,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go back and edit the original motion.

313
00:44:59,766 --> 00:44:59,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.

314
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:00,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read it back.

315
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli moved to ask if someone from the city can assist us in writing a proposal or request for the CPA or look into free cash for funding for lighting updates for the balcony and other needs that Director Rigg brought up to be looked at immediately for public safety purposes.

316
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a second?

317
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

318
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:25,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any more discussion on this particular topic?

319
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:29,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, let's call the roll.

320
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:30,783
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

321
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:33,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

322
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:35,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazzaro.

323
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:38,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Councilman is absent Councilors compelling.

324
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:38,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

325
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:40,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Check Helen.

326
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:40,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

327
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:42,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just fast.

328
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:49,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, or, or, or favor zero pose.

329
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:02,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything further that you want to discuss about the state of LA?

330
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:03,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrific.

331
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:16,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if he helped and if George, as you said, Councilor, excuse me, State Rep Paul Venato was going to do the five year, you know, I'll follow up with him in the morning as well.

332
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:17,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

333
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:24,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll follow up with Mr. Dickinson as well, Mr. Riggi, just to make sure we're all on the same page that you have my number, don't you?

334
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:24,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

335
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:24,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call you.

336
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:25,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know.

337
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:42,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that if, you know, I want to be present also at the meeting, so I know I missed the last couple, but it's important that we get more involved, because we all believe that what you said, it's the engine that keeps Medford Square going right now.

338
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Without the Chevalier right now, I would hate to see where Medford Square is.

339
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:50,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and we should be championing it a lot more.

340
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:54,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, the refurbishing, redevelopment of Medford Square,

341
00:46:55,988 --> 00:47:03,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone talked to the Chevalier about what the plans are and how they're going to incorporate the Chevalier with that process?

342
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Has the city talked to the commission at all?

343
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew Mather was on the RFP committee.

344
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:10,414
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

345
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President.

346
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's on the RFP committee?

347
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:15,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Mather, I believe he said.

348
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Mather, yeah.

349
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:21,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Andrew does a great job and he Bill Boomer right has a great team.

350
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:21,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

351
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,268
[SPEAKER_05]: That's perfect.

352
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:35,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, I didn't realize that so it's good to see that there's someone that's actively working to make sure that you know the Chevalier is a focal point of the redevelopment so but thank you.

353
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

354
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

355
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:39,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a motion.

356
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

357
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,782
[SPEAKER_07]: By Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

358
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:50,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, please call the roll.

359
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:51,725
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're ready.

360
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, thank you very much for your time.

361
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:56,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming.

362
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I say the time is the most precious gift that we have.

363
00:47:58,971 --> 00:48:00,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

364
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:00,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

365
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:03,916

00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:04,576
