1
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:44,704
City Council.

2
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:47,525
Good evening and welcome to the City Facilities Committee for May 20th 2025.

3
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,165
This meeting will take place at five p.m.

4
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:52,646
in the City Council Chamber of Medford City Hall.

5
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,567
85 George B has to drive.

6
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,227
Uh.

7
00:17:56,107 --> 00:18:04,209
Today we are covering item 25 dash 069 offered by me chair Callahan.

8
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,670
It is a resolution to invite the friends of the

9
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:20,542
President bears present council is our council living is absent.

10
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:21,883
I believe for military service.

11
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:24,726
Councilor Scarpelli chair Callahan present.

12
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:26,087
Thank you.

13
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,613
So to start us off, I will just read the resolution first.

14
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:47,596
Whereas the Chevrolet theater is a historic thriving cultural center used by our residents, which brings together people from all over Greater Boston, be it resolved that the city council invite Cindy Watson from the friends of the Chevrolet to attend a public works and facilities meeting to inform our community about the state of the Chevrolet theater.

15
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,337
And I would love to invite Ms.

16
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:55,538
Watson to come up to the podium and give us your

17
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,368
Give us your take on the State of the Chevalier.

18
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,173
Sorry, let me just... Hello?

19
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:07,594
There you go, you're on.

20
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:07,975
Thank you.

21
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,456
First of all, thank you for inviting me to the meeting.

22
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:16,261
And Anna did yeoman's efforts to make sure that this took place at five o'clock.

23
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,283
So thank you for spearheading the meeting.

24
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:19,923
My pleasure.

25
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:23,026
The rate of the pack is determined by the speed of the leader.

26
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,467
So thank you for being the leader.

27
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:36,993
Before we go into what I want to talk about, I also want to thank some of the council members for coming to the Friends of Chevalier meeting.

28
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:44,035
It was a standing room only, as well as those who have chosen to become members.

29
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,275
So thank you.

30
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:52,777
I'm here representing the Friends, which is near and dear to my heart, but I'm also a commissioner.

31
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,781
So this addresses tuitions, okay?

32
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:02,562
I work closely with Paul Donato, all right?

33
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,423
As we know, I was shocked.

34
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,084
I went to some people down at City Hall last week.

35
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:10,284
They had no clue who Paul Donato was.

36
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,526
You know that he's a state rep from Medford, all right?

37
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:21,488
So he and I touch base often because every year he raises $100,000.

38
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,507
for the Chevalier.

39
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:32,190
Okay, so this year, you know, we talk often, he's the Vice President of Friends of Chevalier.

40
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:41,415
He indicated that he went before the House and Ways and Means Committee down at the State House to ask for $150,000 as opposed to $75,000.

41
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:41,535
Well,

42
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:54,963
They were very upset because there was no documentation from the previous year of the $100,000 that he gave us.

43
00:20:56,404 --> 00:21:01,468
Two years ago, we almost lost the money because we didn't spend it by June 30th.

44
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:05,311
Fortunately, we were able to spend the money at that time.

45
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,774
So I told Paul that I would take care of it.

46
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,476
I went down to City Hall.

47
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:16,740
I had the opportunity and the pleasure, I had never met him, to meet with Bob Dickinson.

48
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:26,607
the CFO, I asked him to tell me, these are funds earmarked specifically for the Chevalier.

49
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:38,017
He looked into, I went into his room, the computer, right now there's only $25,000 in the fund, all right?

50
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,359
Today is May 20th.

51
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,702
Obviously, this money is running out.

52
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:48,600
So I mentioned it at the commission meeting on Wednesday.

53
00:21:49,641 --> 00:22:02,933
Okay, now there was a contentious battle somewhat between myself and Paul Riggi, who's the facilities director who oversees 18 facilities.

54
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,175
That's a lot for one person.

55
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:15,875
However, he also indicated that he's responsible for the fiscal aspect of the buildings, which why do we have a financial director?

56
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:22,999
So the meeting ended at approximately, let's say eight o'clock, that's at six o'clock.

57
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:33,565
I just left Wednesday with $25,000 in the account as advised by Bob Dickinson.

58
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:39,829
I had also emailed Brianna, the mayor, about this as well.

59
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:49,518
Ironically, on Thursday morning, I wake up, 7.19, I get a message.

60
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:59,367
Okay, here's the budget for all of a sudden, from Friday night to that morning.

61
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:04,138
Increased emergency lighting, $14,000.

62
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:12,005
Increased, excuse me, replaced antiquated emergency lighting, $18,922.

63
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:19,611
Paid to the exterior, doors to the theater, as well as the handrails and the fire escape, $27,935.

64
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,234
Replaced a non-functional handicapped door opener,

65
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:36,699
at $8,850 and made other improvements for the accessibility to the theater at a rate of $36,579.

66
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,680
Now, I don't believe these are accurate figures.

67
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,563
That very next morning, Friday, I

68
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:53,725
emailed Bob Dickinson because he told me that was the best way to address the situation.

69
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,088
He gets, you know, various phone calls.

70
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:04,915
I also called the mayor, all right, because I don't want to present false information to anybody, all right?

71
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,358
This money is earmarked for the Chevalier alone.

72
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,884
Right now, I don't know if this council knows, we've just had our third lawsuit.

73
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,661
Okay, now I don't know if we're following the rules of indemnification or not.

74
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:27,023
The woman sued because on the balcony, the lighting is very poor.

75
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:34,605
So that's number one, why I'm here to ask for additional funds for the lighting in the balcony.

76
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:36,406
I mean, this is ridiculous.

77
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,607
So where did these funds come from?

78
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:39,927
Where are the numbers?

79
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,648
Can anybody explain it to me?

80
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:48,069
This is within a 12 hour period.

81
00:24:51,011 --> 00:25:02,979
Sorry, this is just, you've just been sort of rattling off some events that happened and I don't have the budget numbers right in front of me.

82
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,001
I mean, I'm sure there is a budget for the Chevalier.

83
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:12,386
Would you like us to follow up with the administration to figure out what the budget is?

84
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:16,237
It should be $100,000 in the arena.

85
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:17,078
Sure.

86
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:17,898
So it sounds like $100,000.

87
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,642
Let me just ask the $100,000.

88
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:29,169
Was that for this fiscal year so that that would be from last July 1 until ending in June 30.

89
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,250
Correct.

90
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,994
So that would mean that was since we're three quarters of the way through that year, that maybe there would be $25,000 left.

91
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:35,614
That was all he had.

92
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,398
That's what he told me.

93
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:39,899
Right.

94
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,563
But it sounded I mean, I look, I wasn't at that conversation.

95
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:45,465
I mean, I'm really just going off of what you said.

96
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:51,932
It sounds like there are twenty five thousand dollars remaining in the budget and there is a quarter of the year left to go.

97
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:55,996
So that doesn't sound particularly odd.

98
00:25:56,436 --> 00:26:09,305
But again, I don't have like I was not I did not realize if you'd asked I could have prepared and had the budget at this meeting, like with all those numbers and knowing what everything had been spent out of that budget.

99
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:14,709
I did not realize that that was what you were going to be asking about today.

100
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:14,949
So

101
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:36,145
Well, my main reason for coming here was to get additional lighting for the balcony, so that great and that that was what I understood that you had some requests of things that you wanted done which, you know, we're happy to, you know, pass along but I think if you want a deeper understanding of what's going on with the budget like we can do that it just might take a little bit of time I'm going to go to Councilor Lazaro.

102
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:40,613
Oh, sorry.

103
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,253
My bad.

104
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:44,075
You're number five?

105
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,476
I'm gonna tell.

106
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,016
Oh, who's requesting?

107
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:49,197
Did I get you?

108
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:49,838
Thank you, yes.

109
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:59,822
So one thing is, if you have a request for funding, we would have to go through the mayor's office.

110
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:02,064
The mayor's office allocates the budget.

111
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:08,347
We can only, as a council, approve or not the budget as it's presented to us from the mayor's office.

112
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:23,113
our meeting at six o'clock tonight is to hear from a variety of departments that are presenting their budgets that have been allocated by the mayor's finance office.

113
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:29,756
So that would be Bob Dickinson and the mayor with input from those departments.

114
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:31,057
Then they present them to us.

115
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:34,098
We hear about why various things are changing and then

116
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,307
When we approve the budget in June.

117
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:45,159
That's what we do but we don't we don't get to have very much input we do send the mayor our suggestions in earlier in the spring, but.

118
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,449
But it is it is useful for us to hear about what the needs are.

119
00:27:50,469 --> 00:28:06,703
We could have if we had done it slightly earlier we could have presented the mayor with some requests, but they're not always met, I sent a variety of requests to the mayor earlier in the spring, they weren't all even close to Matt because there isn't that much money available in the budget

120
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:13,733
Um, if what you're saying is that it wasn't, it was available but it wasn't spent, I think that's my understanding.

121
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,854
He said, Are you sure you are not Bob.

122
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:17,955
So by the way, if I may.

123
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:30,703
Today, at six o'clock, we will have the Chevrolet theater budget on the, so if you just stick around, then you will hear the presentation of the budget for the Chevrolet theater so who's going to present that.

124
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:32,584
Good question.

125
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:37,568
And by the way, also, I believe Paul Riggi is on Zoom and has raised his hand.

126
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,909
So shall we go to him?

127
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:39,810
Is that all right if we go to him?

128
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,110
Fine.

129
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,811
Great.

130
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:41,331
Thank you.

131
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:43,753
Can you?

132
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,639
We're asking you to unmute.

133
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,621
Thank you.

134
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:53,682
I think I'm here.

135
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:53,922
Thank you.

136
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,192
There's several things I'd like to talk about.

137
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,654
One, it came to our attention.

138
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:12,560
Cindy had notified us that Representative Donato wanted an itemized detail of what we spent the money on.

139
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,646
So the list that she just read is myself going through my records, and I keep everything for the Chevalier separate.

140
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:26,809
And that's why I was able to produce that list so quickly.

141
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:39,354
Number two is I have been working all fiscal year on the premise that we receive $100,000 earmark.

142
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:45,600
So I was spending that money for the Chevalier Theatre based on that earmark.

143
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:59,970
Through conversations that we've been having, we are just double checking with the state that the appropriation was properly transferred over to the city of Medford.

144
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:12,516
Bob Dickinson has reached out to the state controller's office to find out the exact date that the earmark was sent over and the exact amount that was sent over.

145
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:28,155
So we're working on that behind the scenes just to double check that the money that representative Donato had earmarked for the Chevalier Theater was actually received by the city of Medford.

146
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:35,042
OK, so as you said yourself, Paul, to quote you,

147
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:44,202
We could possibly be $75,000 in the hole, because I appreciate your efforts in trying to investigate where this money is.

148
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:49,727
However, the commission is the one that really

149
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,414
prompted me to come here.

150
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:55,575
I volunteered and that's how I got in touch with them.

151
00:30:55,835 --> 00:31:00,237
We wouldn't be in the hole because the state has guaranteed the city of Medford that money.

152
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:02,698
So they just need to do the transfer.

153
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:09,681
And that's what we're working on to ensure that the transfer came over properly and is coded properly.

154
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:19,686
It could actually be in the general account for the city and just needs to be transferred over to the special account for the Chevalier Theatre.

155
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:28,196
So that is something we're working on behind the scenes to ensure that it is done and completed properly.

156
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:39,548
OK, well, at May 20th, I would appreciate your efforts to get that money appropriated appropriately so that Paul Donato,

157
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,204
will be satisfied.

158
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,165
Well, we have two issues, Cindy.

159
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:49,028
First, we need to confirm that the state actually transferred it over.

160
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:59,394
And if they did, then that's how we can actually check to ensure where that money is sitting in the city's treasury.

161
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,170
One that's what I have been asking.

162
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,550
Yes.

163
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,411
And that and we're working on that.

164
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,932
But and we're working.

165
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,234
Bob did reach out to the controller.

166
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:14,678
They've been having a conversation so that we're getting closer to the resolution of that issue.

167
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,000
Okay, because

168
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,481
Paul Donato has raised over $5 million for the Chevalier, okay?

169
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,301
He's on the Friends with me.

170
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,102
Excuse me, Paul, let me finish.

171
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,982
He's on the Friends with me.

172
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:39,183
He and two others have been on the Friends for 30 years, since the inception of the Friends.

173
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,824
He deserves to know, and he is our state rep.

174
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:46,145
I'm coming here as a courtesy gesture.

175
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,305
I think it's a little odd that it

176
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:53,540
May 20th, a month away from the end of the year, we don't know.

177
00:32:54,321 --> 00:33:06,466
Now, I am happy for all of your efforts, and I'm grateful that at least this is being pursued, because right now the money's not there, okay?

178
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:17,891
Now, just as an example, as the friends, okay, when we write up things, and I can just, okay, give you a snapshot,

179
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:26,685
All right, we, under, I can't take all credit for this at all, Ken Krause is unbelievable.

180
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:33,788
All right, we've, the friends have raised $1.7 million, all right?

181
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:39,071
It's not just for the Chevalier, it's also for the Medford Youth Center.

182
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:40,868
the YMCA.

183
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:51,937
Just as an example, again, we have the documentation, which I think all parties involved should have and should know how the money is being spent.

184
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,258
We raise the money.

185
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:58,021
We don't get any state money, very little at times.

186
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,703
Or we have people do grant writing.

187
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:06,148
Committed to crafting the city's application to the Mass Gaming Commission.

188
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:23,955
casino mitigation fund, resulting in grants of $300,000 to convert the Chevalier ceiling lighting to LED, it's spectacular, and to install digital billboards near the front entrances to the theater.

189
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,296
All right?

190
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:29,600
Obtained a 10-year, again, as I alluded to,

191
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:46,597
grant, a sustaining grant from the Cummings Foundation to expand a literacy program to the Medford Youth Center, building on the incentives program that has been going on for years.

192
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:53,198
So at least we have the documentation, we do the financial reports.

193
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,499
The commission, unfortunately, does not have a secretary.

194
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,900
So things are now recorded.

195
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,626
So we don't have these figures.

196
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:03,807
All right.

197
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:12,671
So I'm happy, particularly to you, Anna, that you will continue to look up into this because we don't need another lawsuit.

198
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:16,994
Again, when we go, I'm not an attorney.

199
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:21,596
The Chevalier is owned by the city of Medford.

200
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:24,098
So who's going to be sued?

201
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,320
Okay.

202
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:37,802
All right, now a second issue, and I don't know if you folks are, but something this is you can handle.

203
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:42,526
I live across the street from the Heckner Center, all right?

204
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:59,079
Medford secured $850,000 in federal funding to transform the Heckner Center into a vulnerability preparedness site and climate recreation.

205
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,068
The place looks like something out of the Adams family.

206
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:10,832
I have to call every year during the summer because kids are jumping the fence, going in there, doing various things.

207
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,954
So does anybody have any idea as to when that will start?

208
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:21,198
George, Anna, Adam?

209
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:23,439
Councilor Morocco?

210
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:27,381
Cindy, I can actually give you an update on the Heckner Center if you'd like.

211
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:28,801
Thank you.

212
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:29,742
Go ahead.

213
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,056
We are working on that project.

214
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:40,710
The city departments that want to use the center have actually provided a schematic design of the building.

215
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:58,131
and I will be meeting with our outside house doctor to meet on site so they can come up with architectural drawings for the building because that's the next step as part of our grant process to get the architectural drawings done.

216
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:05,693
And once those are done, then the city can actually bid out on the construction for that Heckner Center.

217
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:09,655
So there have been a lot of things going on in the background

218
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:22,244
that will support actually putting a shovel in the ground and getting that turned over to what it is now re-imagined and re-envisioned as.

219
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:30,833
Do you have any expectation of when this might start, because that has been sitting there in that condition for years.

220
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:35,195
Right now they have old police cars in the parking lot.

221
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:41,579
If I may, the Hager Center is actually not on the agenda and I really am interested in understanding.

222
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,704
I thought that you would be giving us the state of the Chevrolet, and I know you specifically wanted to talk about the facility.

223
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,546
No, I just asked if this was something that was appropriate to bring up here.

224
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,330
I'll go to whoever receives the federal money.

225
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,491
George, do you have any idea?

226
00:37:58,612 --> 00:37:59,033
No idea.

227
00:37:59,193 --> 00:37:59,713
Okay, so.

228
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:13,078
But I do have some to the chair.

229
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,080
Representative Donato did call me about the funding.

230
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,961
And he wanted to let us know just an update that they found $25,000.

231
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,482
They reported to Bob Dickinson.

232
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:35,265
And then there is $75,000 that they'll be reaching out tomorrow to make sure that the city of Medford receives that 75,000.

233
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:35,665
So we have that 100,000.

234
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:36,305
He is also asking,

235
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:50,270
the state to follow back to all of the money that was required was to be sent to Medford over the last five years.

236
00:38:50,330 --> 00:39:01,477
So he's doing even a deeper dive and hoping that if there was something that they missed that the city missed or the state missed that we can recover and hopefully help us as we move forward.

237
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:03,919
So I wanted to share that with you.

238
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:05,956
That would be great, George.

239
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:06,736
Thank you.

240
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:10,679
And I know that with the lighting situation, quick question, if I can through the chair.

241
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:11,140
Yes.

242
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:22,308
Have we, has anyone on the, I know that you do a lot, Cindy, I know your team does so much, but has anybody applied for community preservation money to help assist in funding?

243
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,109
Ken has in the past.

244
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,299
Okay, so we got money elsewhere.

245
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,122
This can is going to be leaving a lot of things.

246
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:30,023
So, yeah.

247
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:44,620
So, this current year, my knowledge is that nobody applied for the CPA, because we had money, like I said the $300,000 we got money from mitigation, we get a dollar

248
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,338
back from every single show that's done.

249
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:53,703
So if there's two shows, okay, the maximum capacity is 1900 times two, that's $3,800.

250
00:39:54,324 --> 00:40:04,093
So so I think what I would ask if we could motion that we could ask the city administration to see if someone from the city can assist us in

251
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:10,504
writing a proposal or a wish to CPA for any funding.

252
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:12,665
Did they have a number for the lighting?

253
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,065
Did they get a number by any chance?

254
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,905
Did Mr. Riggi get a number to?

255
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:17,866
Can I respond?

256
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:19,946
Sure.

257
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:20,906
Thank you.

258
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:30,568
What I made very clear at our last commission meeting is that the lighting situation is the next item that will be addressed.

259
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:36,490
and that the new earmark that we would get would address that lighting.

260
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:46,659
Now, if we get money from the state before that, based on the conversation that you had with Representative Donato,

261
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,583
then that lighting would be fast-tracked even faster.

262
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:55,547
So that lighting is something that I know about.

263
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,768
The cost estimate was $63,000.

264
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,029
Since then, we've also

265
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:10,257
found some other areas where we need to improve this type of lighting so the cost would actually be higher.

266
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:18,883
I was going after a cultural grant for that and found out two weeks ago that we got denied funding for this project.

267
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,925
Mr. Regan, I appreciate all the hard work.

268
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:27,629
I know it's very difficult to do what you're doing as a one-person army.

269
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,671
I would still recommend moving forward.

270
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,232
It wouldn't hurt to start the process.

271
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:41,237
for possibly $100,000 CPA funding to support the historical site of Chevalier, because I think it's a public safety issue right now.

272
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:48,178
If we're saying that people are suing us right now, we're losing money more than we're bringing in, so.

273
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:53,539
They're not suing us, they're suing our partner, Blumenreich Productions.

274
00:41:54,739 --> 00:42:00,461
But my question, nobody seemed to know, and there was an attorney there, Lenny Gliana,

275
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:10,534
It, he's gonna look into it, but hopefully it appears as though the city will not have to be responsible.

276
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:14,736
This Bill Boomer productions will be, but nevertheless, it's a concern.

277
00:42:14,996 --> 00:42:20,139
We don't want it some, it was some elderly woman that fell and it fractured her ankle or something.

278
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,700
We don't need to have these types of accidents.

279
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:27,123
The other thing is I still sometimes am amazed

280
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:37,891
that the Chevalier Theatre under Bloom-Bloomwright's production is the economic engine for the city of Medford.

281
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:44,474
I can't tell you how many times the businesses, the restaurants, we only have four, basically five,

282
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:54,302
You know, there's Tacuba the Ford, now we have Mrs. Murphy's, as well as Real Gusto, all right?

283
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:56,363
They are thriving, all right?

284
00:42:58,003 --> 00:42:59,684
They are so happy.

285
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:01,964
I mean, I get phone calls all the time.

286
00:43:02,804 --> 00:43:08,766
So I just feel like sometimes the city of Medford sees the Chevalier as a stepchild.

287
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:15,237
So any efforts that you can do would be terrific.

288
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:15,977
Great.

289
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:20,721
And I still do want to ask, aside from the lighting, it seems like the lighting is on people's radar.

290
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:28,408
Are there other needs that you see in terms of the facilities, things that you would like to happen in the near future?

291
00:43:28,428 --> 00:43:30,910
Are there other needs that you see in the Chevrolet?

292
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:32,373
Absolutely.

293
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:38,958
But I made a motion at the meeting at the commission to make this the number one priority.

294
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:43,201
So I don't want to speak out of turn without getting there.

295
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,522
I mean, we have a laundry list, Anna.

296
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:50,385
So I don't want to speak without, I mean, we're a team.

297
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:52,287
Sure, I apologize.

298
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:53,888
I thought that was what this meeting was about.

299
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:58,392
Well, it's because we're addressing the, you know, the LED lighting.

300
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,433
So, and that's what we need the money for.

301
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,734
So that's correct as opposed to why I'm here, correct?

302
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,675
So it sounds like there is a motion on the floor.

303
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:07,035
Could you maybe repeat?

304
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,036
Did you catch that motion?

305
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:09,716
Mr. Clerk, thank you.

306
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:19,900
Councilor Scarpelli moving to ask if someone from the city can assist us in writing a proposal or request to the CPA, and then you trailed off for a second.

307
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,940
So I'm guessing it's for funding?

308
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:34,107
for any emergency lighting.

309
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:38,769
Hang on for a second.

310
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,490
It used to be a lot quicker.

311
00:44:56,724 --> 00:44:56,984
I know.

312
00:44:57,805 --> 00:44:59,746
I had to go back and edit the original motion.

313
00:44:59,766 --> 00:44:59,986
Hang on.

314
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:00,626
Let me read it back.

315
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:13,994
Councilor Scarpelli moved to ask if someone from the city can assist us in writing a proposal or request for the CPA or look into free cash for funding for lighting updates for the balcony and other needs that Director Rigg brought up to be looked at immediately for public safety purposes.

316
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,175
Do we have a second?

317
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,838
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

318
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:25,581
Is there any more discussion on this particular topic?

319
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:29,622
Great, let's call the roll.

320
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:30,783
President bears.

321
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:33,223
Yes.

322
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:35,644
Council Lazzaro.

323
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:38,564
Yes, Councilman is absent counselors compelling.

324
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:38,884
Yes.

325
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:40,605
Check Helen.

326
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:40,825
Yes.

327
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:42,925
I was just fast.

328
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:49,827
Or, or, or, or favor zero pose.

329
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:02,822
Is there anything further that you want to discuss about the state of LA?

330
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:03,282
Terrific.

331
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:16,172
I think if he helped and if George, as you said, counselor, excuse me, State Rep Paul Venato was going to do the five year, you know, I'll follow up with him in the morning as well.

332
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:17,373
Okay.

333
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:24,078
I'll follow up with Mr. Dickinson as well, Mr. Riggi, just to make sure we're all on the same page that you have my number, don't you?

334
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:24,278
I do.

335
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:24,778
I'll call you.

336
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:25,399
I'll let you know.

337
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:42,859
And I think that if, you know, I want to be present also at the meeting, so I know I missed the last couple, but it's important that we get more involved, because we all believe that what you said, it's the engine that keeps Meffitt Square going right now.

338
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:47,462
Without the Chevalier right now, I would hate to see where Meffitt Square is.

339
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:50,525
So, and we should be championing it a lot more.

340
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:54,888
And like I said, the refurbishing, redevelopment of Meffitt Square,

341
00:46:55,988 --> 00:47:03,791
Has anyone talked to the Chevalier about what the plans are and how they're going to incorporate the Chevalier with that process?

342
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:05,972
Has the city talked to the commission at all?

343
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,113
Andrew Mather was on the RFP committee.

344
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:10,414
OK.

345
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,755
Thank you, Council President.

346
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,035
Who's on the RFP committee?

347
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:15,376
Mr. Mather, I believe he said.

348
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:16,743
Andrew Mather, yeah.

349
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:21,066
Yeah, Andrew does a great job and he Bill Boomer right has a great team.

350
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:21,487
Yep.

351
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,268
That's perfect.

352
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:35,358
I didn't, I didn't realize that so it's good to see that there's someone that's actively working to make sure that you know the Chevalier is a focal point of the redevelopment so but thank you.

353
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:36,119
Thank you.

354
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,701
Thank you so much.

355
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:39,481
Do we have a motion.

356
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,283
Motion to adjourn.

357
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,782
By Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

358
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:50,224
Clerk, please call the roll.

359
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:51,725
When you're ready.

360
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:55,508
All right, well, thank you very much for your time.

361
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:56,229
Thank you for coming.

362
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,591
I say the time is the most precious gift that we have.

363
00:47:58,971 --> 00:48:00,012
So thank you.

364
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:00,653
Of course.

365
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:03,916
President Behrs?

366
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:04,576
Yes.

367
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:05,937
Councilor Lazzaro?

368
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:06,077
Yes.

369
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:07,899
Councilor Lemming is absent.

370
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:08,620
Councilor Scarpelli?

371
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:08,920
Yes.

372
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,700

00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:09,841
Yes.
