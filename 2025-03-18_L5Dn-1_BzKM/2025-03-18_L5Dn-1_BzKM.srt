1
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:11,507
[SPEAKER_29]: The 28th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,753
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,513
[SPEAKER_29]: Present, seven members present, none absent.

4
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,514
[SPEAKER_29]: Please join us in rising to salute the flag.

5
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:52,386
[SPEAKER_29]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

6
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:58,331
[SPEAKER_29]: My apologies for this microphone, but we're obviously having technical difficulties.

7
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,835
[SPEAKER_29]: Item of business is commendations for Eagle Scout,

8
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:04,527
[SPEAKER_29]: for Mr. Andrew Knight.

9
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:19,999
[SPEAKER_29]: And at this time, I invite, I invite Councilor Marks up, whose motion this was to commend our friend, Andrew.

10
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

11
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:45,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my honor and pleasure, Mr. President, tonight to recognize a young gentleman in our community who has put in countless hours to rise to the top of being a Boy Scout.

12
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:53,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone that's been in the Scouts realizes that you go through different levels to attain the highest level, which is Eagle Scout.

13
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:57,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's many countless hours of

14
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:06,459
[SPEAKER_07]: community participation, it's many countless hours of obtaining badges, field trips, and then leadership within the scouts.

15
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we have a young gentleman in pack 416.

16
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the Otis Street Church, United Methodist Church, that sponsors the PAC.

17
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:30,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And over the last, let's say, three or four years, I've had the privilege of recognizing many Eagle Scout recipients.

18
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,855
[SPEAKER_07]: from the Otis Street Pack.

19
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:43,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've done yeoman's work in representing our community and putting out young gentlemen of Andrew's caliber within our community.

20
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:46,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few things I'd like to state.

21
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:53,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew earned 28 merit badges, 21 of which were Eagle required.

22
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,827
[SPEAKER_07]: He had various positions in the troop, including patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader, and senior patrol leader.

23
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:11,475
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of the Eagle Scout, every Eagle Scout is required to submit a community service project.

24
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:15,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've had a number of Eagle Scouts within our community.

25
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,164
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one I recall was an Eagle Scout that fixed the flagpole when it came down during a hurricane,

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,940
[SPEAKER_07]: in front of the Medford Public Library.

27
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And he did a fundraiser and raised funds and so forth.

28
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And he also put some shrubbery and bushes around that and erected our flag.

29
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:37,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And Andrew came up with a great concept as part of his project.

30
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:42,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like for him to say a few words on the project itself.

31
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:46,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, most of the times I ask,

32
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: people, would you like to come up and say a word or two?

33
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And Andrew, without hesitation, said, absolutely.

34
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So he must be a gifted speaker.

35
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

36
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I set the table for you now.

37
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So Andrew would like to say a few words.

38
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:10,592
[SPEAKER_07]: One other point I'd like to mention is when you look at Eagle Scout, it's not just the scout that's going through it.

39
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the mom and dad, which we have in the audience tonight.

40
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:24,689
[SPEAKER_07]: that, as they could probably attest to, spend many countless hours on these projects and chaperoning the scout around and so forth, and they participate as well.

41
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:28,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But an interesting fact is only about 5% of all Boy Scouts

42
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: attain the rank of Eagle Scout.

43
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:43,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And since 1912, when this was established, there has been 1,700,000 Boy Scouts that have earned the rank of Eagle Scout.

44
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:59,270
[SPEAKER_07]: That may sound like a lot, but we're talking over 100 years worth of millions of Boy Scouts, hundreds of millions of Boy Scouts throughout this country.

45
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, truly a big honor to obtain this level.

46
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:08,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this point, I'd like to pass it over to Andrew so he can explain his community service project.

47
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank you for inviting me here.

48
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:23,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my community service project, I decided to do it for the Medford Boys and Girls Club located on Forest Street, because I've been going there as a kid ever since I was six years old.

49
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:27,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going school years and summers, and it's kind of like a place that I've grown up at.

50
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:33,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it was time for me to do a project for a community, it was easy for me to decide to do something for them.

51
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:37,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the club director, Lisa Gosbecki, and I talked to her about

52
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,777
[SPEAKER_01]: the type of things that you would need at the Boys and Girls Club that would benefit them the most.

53
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:54,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told me that some type of recycling-oriented thing would help the kids learn about recycling and help them dispose of recycling materials properly, because at the time, they only had trash.

54
00:05:55,044 --> 00:06:05,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So I then went back and made a plan to build a recycling center that would sort the recycling machine, paper, plastic, and cans, and then designed a recycling program that

55
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:14,550
[SPEAKER_01]: had games and activities that would teach the kids about recycling so that they could learn and take the knowledge home about what you're supposed to do with these materials so that it can better our environment.

56
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:23,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So then with my troop, I coordinated the building of the recycling center and then designed games and made activities for the kids.

57
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:26,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And I presented it at a family night at the Boys and Girls Club.

58
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were families there, kids there.

59
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to present the box and the information to everyone there so that

60
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,168
[SPEAKER_01]: they could learn about recycling.

61
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also worked as my Eagle Scout project after all the time I put in.

62
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was basically the impact it had on the community.

63
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,411
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the kids learned about recycling.

64
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:54,934
[SPEAKER_01]: They learned things that they've never heard about before, like how long it takes for things to decompose, because you never really think about that when you might throw away a styrofoam cup in the trash.

65
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, that thing never decomposes.

66
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:02,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're more aware of what they're doing now, and they can better the environment.

67
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we can see, Andrew will be in good company.

68
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:34,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Eagle Scouts, Neil Armstrong, Michael Bloomberg, Method Man, Stephen Breyer, Judge Breyer, President Gerald Ford, Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State, Steven Spielberg.

69
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:37,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're in a real elite group, Andrew.

70
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:42,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this time, I'd just like to present the Method City Council accommodation.

71
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:53,049
[SPEAKER_07]: says the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Andrew Knight, Eagle Scout, Court of Honor Troop 416, on attaining this high ranking within scouting.

72
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:00,151
[SPEAKER_07]: The realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to success and accomplishments throughout your life.

73
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Signed by Council President Frederick Dello Russo and myself, City Council, Michael Marks.

74
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

75
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:15,344
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could take a picture out here, that'd be great.

76
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:06,883
Can you hear the smoke?

77
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

78
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:05,317
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello for motion to suspension of the rules.

79
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:06,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if we could take up motion number 16679, Mr. President.

81
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:17,848
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello to take out of order, paper number 16679.

82
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:19,189
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

83
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,510
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

84
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,771
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

85
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,814
[SPEAKER_29]: The ayes have it.

86
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,515
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-679 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

87
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,758
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved that Medford City Council request the mayor

88
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:37,951
[SPEAKER_29]: to install a traffic light at the corner of High Street and Alston Street at the Brooks School for the Safety of Children.

89
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:42,274
[SPEAKER_29]: Many parents have contacted me since the side of school about this problem.

90
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:43,495
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Councilor.

91
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:44,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

92
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, fortunately, we come here tonight.

93
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:56,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Though I had this on the agenda last week, we come here tonight because a young man was struck last Friday night by a car.

94
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortunately, he was not injured.

95
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:01,592
[SPEAKER_05]: He was slightly injured.

96
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,514
[SPEAKER_05]: His parents are here tonight.

97
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:07,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, thank God he wasn't hurt seriously, which is a saving grace.

98
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:14,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mr. President, that's been a problem on that corner for many years since my children went to school there.

99
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:22,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this day, with the traffic increasing and more people distracted driving,

100
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:25,073
[SPEAKER_05]: The road is becoming heavier and heavier and heavier.

101
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:29,536
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't adhere to the crosswalks.

102
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though there's a crossing guard there during the day, there's a lot of school activities there in the evening.

103
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:41,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Brooks School is one of the heaviest for after school programs in the city.

104
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:46,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think at this point, some changes need to be made on that corner.

105
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, I would think

106
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: A street light should be installed with maybe a flashing light.

107
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: St.

108
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Raphael's has a light in front of theirs.

109
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:58,902
[SPEAKER_05]: St.

110
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph has a light in front of their school.

111
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:08,430
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some easy things we could do to make that area better also.

112
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: One is, in the evening, getting rid of those orange lights.

113
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:21,060
[SPEAKER_05]: They're dim and they don't, I mean, for the few pennies that we're saving on them, it's not worth it to have them there.

114
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:29,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to put either LEDs or go back to the bright white lights so people can see it both in front of the school and on the side.

115
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:34,407
[SPEAKER_05]: where all the kids come out at 5 o'clock when the parents go by to pick them up on Auburn Street.

116
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:35,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that's a dark area.

117
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:47,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, you know, one of the parents gave me some suggestions here about changing some markings that a highway person gave them.

118
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:53,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And some simple things like putting the markers in the middle of the road during the day.

119
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people are coming through that way now because

120
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Route 16 is a nightmare to get down to from route two.

121
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So now everybody's coming down route 60 to get the 93.

122
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:05,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cars are getting, you know, they're just traffic.

123
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:06,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just increasing.

124
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Speed is increasing and people they're on the cell phones and they're texting and they're not paying attention.

125
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

126
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:19,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point I would, I would ask that we ask the mayor to immediately requisition the traffic light to be put there.

127
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:20,931
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

128
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:24,152
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor chair recognizes vice president Lungo-Koehn.

129
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

130
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:28,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda.

131
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:37,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew it was going to come up because all of us have got the phone calls and emails with regards to the complaints and what happened Friday night, and it's pretty disturbing.

132
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:39,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank God the child is okay.

133
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree wholeheartedly there should be a traffic light.

134
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also think part of this is, you know, the enforcement

135
00:13:52,782 --> 00:14:02,504
[SPEAKER_15]: quite possibly putting a, somewhere on the road, putting a speed limit sign so people know how fast they're going, because I think speeding has a factor.

136
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:08,485
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we don't have enough enforcement, it obviously leads to the speeding.

137
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:17,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've brought that up many, many times, to have speed limit signs like we have on Elm Street put in different locations in the city, especially near the schools.

138
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,648
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would just like to add that.

139
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:24,584
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhere near the Brooks School sign letting people know how fast they're going.

140
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:28,927
[SPEAKER_15]: To deter speeding would also help along with the traffic light.

141
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:34,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully we'll be able to deter any future accident that even could possibly happen at that location.

142
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:40,854
[SPEAKER_15]: We also need to take a look at, you know, all of our schools and make sure we have them all safe.

143
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:46,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know Walk Medford is doing a good job evaluating the community

144
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:56,310
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also believe there's a grant that was received, and I'm not sure if that went out for a proposal or how we're going to be spending that money, but I believe it hasn't been spent yet.

145
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:12,742
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's something we need to get on top of and make sure we make the appropriate changes at every location, everywhere in the community, because we just want to keep the pedestrians safe from, you know, and do everything we can to deter any accidents anywhere that could happen.

146
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello.

147
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:30,082
[SPEAKER_29]: second, the resolve and, um, move to amend it to as, as, as stated on the motion, uh, offered by, uh, council caviello, uh, seconded by vice president longer current and amended, uh, chair recognizes councilor Falco.

148
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:34,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to thank, uh, councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward tonight.

150
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this is an issue that, uh, needs to be addressed.

151
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:44,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's long overdue and, uh, I would, uh, support the addition of a traffic light at that intersection, a hundred percent.

152
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:48,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The traffic is out of control down there.

153
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:52,434
[SPEAKER_03]: People seem to, no one pays attention to where they're driving.

154
00:15:52,454 --> 00:16:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes everywhere, but I think in between when we get a traffic light put in and today, we need to come up with some steps to actually make this a safer intersection for our students.

155
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: and for just everyone in general.

156
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:15,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think definitely additional signage, hopefully additional police presence, but I'd also like to see a crossing guard added in the morning for the middle school students.

157
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:21,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we currently have one for the elementary school students, but I think that the middle school students also need one as well.

158
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:30,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I have received calls from parents that have kids in middle school and it is a very hard intersection to navigate in the morning.

159
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:37,826
[SPEAKER_03]: in the afternoon, and I believe that a crossing guard for the middle school students would be beneficial as well.

160
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:46,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I also talked to Superintendent Belson, and I was advocating for additional crossing guard with him as well.

161
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:57,015
[SPEAKER_03]: He had told me that, I guess there's going to be a meeting, I think on Thursday, between the mayor and the superintendent, and I think the police chief as well, and I think they're gonna hopefully work on a solution for this.

162
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:00,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also, and I also believe too that

163
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:04,046
[SPEAKER_03]: The city really needs to hire a traffic engineer.

164
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:18,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a traffic engineer would help with a lot of these problems just by looking at how our roads are set up, what we can do to keep our residents and everyone that passes through our city safe, and just make commuting in general safer.

165
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:33,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, you know, I'll keep advocating for that, but I think a traffic engineer is something that we desperately need in the city as more and more people move to our city and our city just becomes, I think, more popular as each day goes by with people wanting to move here, businesses wanting to set up here.

166
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something that we desperately need.

167
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So I support this 100%.

168
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:44,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward this morning, this morning, tonight.

169
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a long day.

170
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And I definitely support this resolution.

171
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

172
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:50,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

173
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:58,709
[SPEAKER_29]: So on today's motion, it's amended by Vice President Long and Kern and Councilor Falco.

174
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:00,510
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

175
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,570
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

176
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:10,872
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you to my colleagues for your input on this important issue.

177
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:14,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Having grown up in the area and attended the Brooks School and having been involved

178
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:21,072
[SPEAKER_22]: near accidents myself as a child in that intersection, I certainly understand the situation that's at hand, Mr. President.

179
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:30,479
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things that I was thinking, listening to Councilor Caraviello in his presentation would be, we do have a dock pickup area on Auburn Street.

180
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,821
[SPEAKER_22]: If this ordinance gets passed this evening, there's no guarantee that those lights are gonna be changed tomorrow.

181
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:35,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So.

182
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:51,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Do I sound like Sinatra?

183
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:59,761
[SPEAKER_22]: So, as I was saying, Mr. President, I think Councilor Caraviello brings up some several good points, as does Councilor Falco.

184
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:05,705
[SPEAKER_22]: One thing that concerns me is that these events have been occurring quite frequently.

185
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:10,048
[SPEAKER_22]: They've been occurring for a number of years, and I believe there should be some reporting requirement that's taking place.

186
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:11,209
[SPEAKER_22]: at the school level.

187
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:24,779
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm wondering if we can amend the resolution to request that the principal of the Brooks School, Suzanne Galusi, provide us with any suggestions or input that she may have in what she feels as though would make her job a little easier and make the students there safer.

188
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:26,160
[SPEAKER_22]: She's there every day, Mr. President.

189
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:35,247
[SPEAKER_22]: She also went to the Brooks School and grew up in the neighborhood, so I think she has a pretty good grasp and handle on the issues at hand, and I think that she'd be able to provide us with some very helpful information.

190
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:49,436
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the other items I'd like her to look into, if possible, would be to move the pickup area to the rear end on Prescott Street, where there's a large lot that people can pull in and out of, where students can congregate free and absent of being right next to the main roadway, Mr. President.

191
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,558
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are the two items that I'd like to add to this matter.

192
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:54,780
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the Councilor for bringing it forward and it's something that I support.

193
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,740
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

194
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,621
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor.

195
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,223
[SPEAKER_29]: And as amended by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

196
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:02,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

197
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:05,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was a number of good suggestions.

198
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:24,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Often, um, there was a pilot program created, uh, I believe it was about three years ago at a request of this council, uh, to implement raised crosswalks throughout the community and other, uh, communities have been very successful, uh, in using raised crosswalks as a traffic calming approach.

199
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:29,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, to date we've had one raised crosswalk,

200
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:33,274
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, which was implemented on Winthrop street.

201
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:37,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're still waiting for the other two as part of the pilot program.

202
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:47,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've asked the administration a dozen times and we have yet to get a response on, uh, when the other two race crosswalks will take place.

203
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:51,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, this is not rocket science and you know,

204
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,247
[SPEAKER_07]: in particular around schools, around senior buildings.

205
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,268
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many methods that you can use.

206
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Many communities widen the sidewalks.

207
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:11,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you widen your sidewalks, it slows down traffic because you don't have, as we all know, High Street is two lanes, but they're very wide.

208
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:17,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And it lends itself for cars to pick up speed in that area.

209
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:19,937
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also markings you can put on the road

210
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:30,892
[SPEAKER_07]: that when cars approach they appear to be, they're 3D in nature, and they appear to be some type of obstruction in the roadway, and cars tend to slow down.

211
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:36,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have raised crosswalks, you have these 3D images in the road, you can widen sidewalks.

212
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:41,477
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a number of approaches that we can take, in particular around school.

213
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:46,106
[SPEAKER_07]: zones to make sure that our children are safe when crossing.

214
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:54,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's far easier to cross a road that's maybe 25 feet in length or width rather than 45 feet in width.

215
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are the things that really we need to move forward on as a city.

216
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're finding it difficult to get the administration to just paint crosswalks.

217
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:09,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's another issue that's going to be brought up, uh, tonight.

218
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:15,769
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, here we are in September and we still haven't painted all our crosswalks throughout the community.

219
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,875
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just basic, basic, uh, public safety, uh, um, initiatives that could take place.

220
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:24,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with councilor Falco.

221
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:35,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, uh, that we do need to hire, uh, an engineer, a traffic engineer, uh, within the office of community development and a city this size, uh, with the number of streets we have, the number of intersections,

222
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:48,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's only appropriate in that we can't rely on the traffic commission to solve all our woes, but we can take some small initiatives to make our streets safer.

223
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been saying for years, we have to take our roads back.

224
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:57,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at a point right now, people don't want to go out and do a power walk because they're afraid to be on the sidewalks.

225
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,830
[SPEAKER_07]: They're afraid when they get to an intersection that they have to cross.

226
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, our city should be much more user-friendly when it comes to pedestrians.

227
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:15,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would also add, Mr. President, that a raised crosswalk at that particular area would be reviewed by the Traffic Commission.

228
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a set of lights is great there, too.

229
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:26,146
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we have to look at a number of options that we can explore.

230
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a raised crosswalk is very beneficial.

231
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:33,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I know on Winthrop Street it has done a lot.

232
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:40,646
[SPEAKER_07]: If you talk to area residents, at first they heard a lot of banging of the undercarriage of cars because people didn't recognize it.

233
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with the neon signs on both sides of

234
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:52,928
[SPEAKER_07]: the road, but now people do, if you stand out there and watch, people do slow down when they come to that raised crosswalk on Withrop Street.

235
00:23:53,248 --> 00:24:00,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be my suggestion, Mr. President, that these issues be looked at immediately in the interest of public safety.

236
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,068
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor.

237
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:07,712
[SPEAKER_29]: So as amended by Councilor Marks, Chair recognizes the citizens who wish to speak.

238
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:09,132
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

239
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,073
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

240
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,495
[SPEAKER_31]: Frank O'Leary, 85 Arlington Street.

241
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:16,757
[SPEAKER_31]: Also a board member of the Medford Community Coalition.

242
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:21,339
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to thank you for taking up this initiative out of order.

243
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,342
[SPEAKER_31]: I witnessed the incident on Friday night and

244
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:29,498
[SPEAKER_31]: something definitely needs to be done.

245
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:35,580
[SPEAKER_31]: There've been many conversations on social media about the traffic around that particular area.

246
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:44,823
[SPEAKER_31]: There've been many C click fix postings that have gone ignored, you know, not just for that area, but for other areas for similar incidents.

247
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:52,705
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, it's one of these times we may have a worse issue than what happened on Friday.

248
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,606
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank God,

249
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:58,579
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, the boy's okay, but it's one of these times we're not gonna be so lucky.

250
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,079
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to, this needs to be addressed sooner than later.

251
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,940
[SPEAKER_31]: The planning, I understand looking at it and getting engineers, but something needs to be done sooner.

252
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,321
[SPEAKER_31]: Put a barrel in there, one of those white and orange barrels right in the middle that's filled with concrete or water.

253
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:16,122
[SPEAKER_31]: First time somebody hits it, they're not gonna hit it again.

254
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:21,163
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, put a, you know, get traffic enforcement there.

255
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:22,623
[SPEAKER_31]: Part of this is,

256
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:30,232
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, maybe they need to have a police officer further down to tick, to watch that and pull people over and ticket them.

257
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:36,277
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, a couple of times of people seeing other people get pulled over, you never heard mentality.

258
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:41,982
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to start getting scared and they'll start slowing down because they'll always suspect that there'll be a police officer there.

259
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:52,410
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, but I just wanted to come up and say thank you and let you know that there would have been more parents here to support this, but there's multiple PTO meetings tonight.

260
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:55,764
[SPEAKER_31]: And Andrew was in Brooks and the high school.

261
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:58,786
[SPEAKER_31]: And I was told that I had better mention that or I'll be hunted down.

262
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:00,848
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you very much.

263
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,629
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. O'Leary.

264
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:05,031
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi.

265
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:05,992
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

266
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,733
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

267
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

268
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Luke McNeely, 26 Whitney Road.

269
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two daughters at the Brooks School.

270
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:18,392
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not witness the event but heard about it after the fact.

271
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:28,375
[SPEAKER_12]: I cross, I walk to school every day with my daughters and I cross that road and I'm very thankful for the crossing guard who controls that intersection very well.

272
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:34,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that there's obviously conflicting needs at that intersection.

273
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:45,288
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got a lot of commuters who need to get through, who aren't necessarily from our community, but utilize it as a means to get to where they need to go.

274
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:55,551
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got key moments when kids and adults need to cross that street at that particular intersection.

275
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:58,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, we've got other intersections of similar

276
00:26:58,488 --> 00:26:59,809
[SPEAKER_12]: importance throughout the city.

277
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:18,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm extremely thankful that we have the traffic department putting an intelligent and capable person at the intersection at those key moments, but whenever there isn't a key moment throughout the day, I understand middle schoolers also cross when there is not a crossing guard.

278
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,745
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important that there be some smart

279
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:30,487
[SPEAKER_12]: ability to stop traffic only as needed, but as needed and on demand.

280
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Traffic signal, a crossing signal would help with that.

281
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:45,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly agree an engineer could help us look at other intersections to help avoid this kind of issue down the road.

282
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your attention on this.

283
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's an important issue.

284
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. McNally.

285
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:53,512
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

286
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:53,932
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

287
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:55,513
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

288
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:56,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

289
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt Carty, 58 Summit Road.

290
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:00,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some written comments.

291
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping could be entered in a public record.

292
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just going to mention a couple things from them.

293
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco, I think that's a great idea, having a traffic engineer.

294
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,318
[SPEAKER_08]: A traffic light intuitively is the right answer.

295
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:14,918
[SPEAKER_08]: But what does yellow light mean?

296
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:15,999
[SPEAKER_08]: It means speed up.

297
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,540
[SPEAKER_08]: There are treatments, Councilor Marks mentioned,

298
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:27,079
[SPEAKER_08]: The raised crosswalk, I think infrastructure treatments ought to be studied.

299
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,285
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the sorts of things that are there 24-7 when a crossing guard or a police officer goes home.

300
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,589
[SPEAKER_08]: The best thing you can do for a road is narrow the lanes.

301
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Narrowing the lanes reduces the speed of the cars.

302
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:56,715
[SPEAKER_08]: A study done by MIT a couple years ago on these streets, Cambridge and Boston streets at least, showed that people moving 40 miles an hour are four times less likely to stop for a person in the crosswalk than someone moving at 20.

303
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:02,138
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that if you're hit at 20 miles an hour, you have an 80% chance of surviving.

304
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,260
[SPEAKER_08]: At 30, 40, it drops to 10% chance.

305
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:09,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Slowing the cars by narrowing the lanes, it can be done,

306
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:15,271
[SPEAKER_08]: in consultation with the traffic engineer, it's a 53-foot wide right-of-way at that point.

307
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:18,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that is a really long way to cross.

308
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:40,011
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bus stop on each side so there might not be a lot you can do in the immediate term With that width as far as bump outs you'd have to talk to MBTA about moving those bus stops But that's the right thing to do and I like the suggestion earlier about the barrel in the middle of the road If you go by Tufts on College Avenue right in the middle of the crosswalk, they have a

309
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,753
[SPEAKER_08]: A little pop-up thing.

310
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:43,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you hit it, it just bounces out of the way.

311
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:47,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, drivers yield for pedestrians.

312
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:54,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the sort of thing that keeps people from edging out and making a dangerous pass.

313
00:29:55,084 --> 00:30:07,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are all things a traffic engineer, I think, could give us a better solution, one that's more effective and maybe even costs less than a traffic light that we might otherwise want to rush into.

314
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:09,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much for your time.

315
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:17,363
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you much, sir, and submit your written remarks to the messenger, and he'll make sure that the clerk puts them into the record of the council.

316
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:18,643
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

317
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,204
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

318
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:22,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Thomas Dobson, 21 Irving Street.

319
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:27,968
[SPEAKER_17]: It was my son and I that were hit Friday night in front of the Brooks School.

320
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:30,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this to order.

321
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco, I 100% agree about a traffic engineer.

322
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:35,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I think somebody from outside the city

323
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,443
[SPEAKER_17]: could definitely make this better, however they do it.

324
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:48,646
[SPEAKER_17]: In the meantime, putting up just a sign right along the yellow line, just to let people know there's a crosswalk there.

325
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:56,370
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a long stretch of road where people can build up way too much speed before coming to the walkway in front of St.

326
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Raphael's, all the railroad tracks, and then coming from St.

327
00:30:58,871 --> 00:30:59,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Joe's, same reason.

328
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:13,019
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree there should be a walk late there, and I just want to say thank you for bringing it up tonight, and I thank you to the Medford Police and Fire and Armstrong Ambulance for their quick response time and definitely being able to be there.

329
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:14,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

330
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

331
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:19,343
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi.

332
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:19,403
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi.

333
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,904
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

334
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:24,966
[SPEAKER_35]: Kelly Braverman, 97 Alston Street.

335
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,268
[SPEAKER_35]: I've lived in this area that we're all talking about for the past 16 years.

336
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:34,806
[SPEAKER_35]: My whole time living there, it's been very treacherous trying to cross the street.

337
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,328
[SPEAKER_35]: I have a middle schooler now in seventh grade and a fifth grader.

338
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:41,511
[SPEAKER_35]: The seventh grader has to cross the street every day.

339
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:44,233
[SPEAKER_35]: He has been almost hit numerous times.

340
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,635
[SPEAKER_35]: I can count him on more than two hands.

341
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:54,621
[SPEAKER_35]: People that stop for him go around and almost like side swipe him, like what happened to Tom Dobson's child.

342
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,143
[SPEAKER_35]: It's just, something needs to be done.

343
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,845
[SPEAKER_35]: We do have flashing lights.

344
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:01,647
[SPEAKER_35]: They don't work.

345
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:04,028
[SPEAKER_35]: We do have more signage now.

346
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:05,088
[SPEAKER_35]: They haven't worked.

347
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:08,529
[SPEAKER_35]: Something, we need to curb that street.

348
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:09,709
[SPEAKER_35]: It's too wide.

349
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,450
[SPEAKER_35]: So, just wanted to let you know.

350
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:20,692
[SPEAKER_35]: Also, I know that we have a grant for $400,000 or something, and Alston High is on that, but we can't wait.

351
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,794
[SPEAKER_35]: Something has to happen sooner than waiting for this grant to come around.

352
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:25,374
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks.

353
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,414
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

354
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:27,874
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

355
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:29,555
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

356
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:31,838
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening.

357
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,019
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, Chris Davido, 67 West street.

358
00:32:34,679 --> 00:33:00,087
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, the person who spoke a couple of people before me basically said what I was going to say, which is the, the narrowing of that roadway is really the only way to properly slow cars down because, um, and especially for people trying to cross at the crosswalks where we've all traveled that road, we know you can't really see the person as you're traveling the roadway.

359
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:00,807
[SPEAKER_34]: It's wide enough.

360
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:05,862
[SPEAKER_34]: so that it's out of your peripheral, it's in your peripheral vision, just at the edge.

361
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:20,785
[SPEAKER_34]: And if you try to, of course, edge out onto the roadway between cars, even when there's no parking at the bus stop there, you're kind of blocked coming down High Street.

362
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:29,607
[SPEAKER_34]: I did wanna say that, and maybe I missed this earlier, got here a little late, is that there seems to be no signal

363
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:36,716
[SPEAKER_34]: on all of High Street until you get to Medford Square, essentially.

364
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:41,219
[SPEAKER_34]: There are two pedestrian signals, one at St.

365
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,380
[SPEAKER_34]: Ray's and one at St.

366
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,561
[SPEAKER_34]: Joe's in front of the library.

367
00:33:46,302 --> 00:33:51,545
[SPEAKER_34]: But I don't think there's any signal until Medford Square there, essentially.

368
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:58,129
[SPEAKER_34]: So that whole stretch of High Street, people kind of see as a way to go through.

369
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,830
[SPEAKER_34]: Of course, the railroad signal.

370
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,501
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just want to emphasize that.

371
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:12,369
[SPEAKER_34]: And this is not a new issue in a way because some of us parents had been working with the prior administration on getting a traffic calming measure there.

372
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:20,816
[SPEAKER_34]: And those speed sensors you see now are the result of that.

373
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,798
[SPEAKER_34]: Mayor McClain put those in.

374
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,400
[SPEAKER_34]: I think one is functional and one is not at the moment.

375
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:33,681
[SPEAKER_34]: Those are part of the solution, but not the complete solution.

376
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:45,909
[SPEAKER_34]: Obviously, we need to slow traffic down to prevent what happened about a year ago, which is a truck driving up onto someone's lawn, traveling too fast, trying to avoid a collision.

377
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,171
[SPEAKER_34]: That could have been a deadly accident.

378
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,232
[SPEAKER_34]: Luckily, no one was hurt.

379
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,695
[SPEAKER_34]: So that's all I want to say.

380
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:54,975
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

381
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:56,576
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, sir.

382
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,908
[SPEAKER_29]: Ma'am, will you or the young man be speaking tonight?

383
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:05,389
[SPEAKER_02]: He's leaving behind some of his dinner.

384
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily Stein, 177 High Street.

385
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here as a parent, a resident.

386
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with Safe Roads Alliance and also part of the Vision Zero Coalition in Boston.

387
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Road safety has unfortunately become part of my life because my dad was killed by a distracted driver five years ago.

388
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm here.

389
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:28,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I was here several years ago to speak to you all about

390
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have stronger legislation within the city limits of Medford?

391
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is something we can do.

392
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:38,292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that other cities have done.

393
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need the structural changes.

394
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the education, but we also need enforcement.

395
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to change the culture of driving.

396
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:51,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And Medford is, I live right near Winthrop Circle.

397
00:35:52,056 --> 00:35:53,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people speed by.

398
00:35:53,864 --> 00:36:00,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I see disasters happening there, so obviously there are all these places in the city that need structural changes.

399
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:09,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people on their phones texting shamelessly in front of the Brooks School moving.

400
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,894
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not stuck in traffic, but they are moving.

401
00:36:11,914 --> 00:36:22,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only can we make serious changes that are short-term and long-term changes at that crosswalk and many others across the city, but I think we also need to address

402
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:27,271
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we change people's attitudes, commuters going through here?

403
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:34,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say maybe we can put up a sign that says 20 miles an hour or drive like your kids live here.

404
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:35,217
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 is plenty.

405
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say the culture of Medford won't really like that.

406
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:47,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the solution is, but I think we really need to drive home that enforcement is taking this a lot more seriously than they need to take it a lot more seriously than they are.

407
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: and that we also need to stand up for our community to show that we care and we're not gonna tolerate speeding.

408
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,252
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not gonna tolerate people being distracted in school zones and work zones in our city.

409
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:05,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love your help in trying to figure out how we can do this as a city as well.

410
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:06,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

411
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:08,238
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for coming up tonight.

412
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:14,362
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening, Chief.

413
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:15,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

414
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:19,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Leo Sacco, 227 Elm Street in Medford.

415
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,061
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, police chief here in the city.

416
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:24,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I've heard the suggestions, I've heard them loud and clear.

417
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:33,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very thankful that Friday evening, Mr. Dodson was with his son, uh, had his son been just a couple of seconds later, the consequences could have been a lot greater.

418
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:41,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, thankfully that, you know, he survived that with some minor bruising and I'm sure traumatized from the whole incident.

419
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:47,374
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've heard a lot of things tonight and I think I was validated because I know I've told this council in the past,

420
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:51,825
[SPEAKER_16]: The public in general, when they're driving, they do not pay attention to signs.

421
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,907
[SPEAKER_16]: You can have the flashing speed limit signs out there.

422
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:56,669
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not paying attention to them.

423
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:00,491
[SPEAKER_16]: They do help to some degree, but a lot of them don't pay attention to them.

424
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:14,800
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the flashing lights on Harvard Street, or the ones in front of the Brooks School, or even the ones on Elm Street that they placed, sometimes you see people going faster just to see how high up the number will go, depending on the hour of the day.

425
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anything gets around enforcement.

426
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:29,496
[SPEAKER_16]: we do have to do a lot more enforcement in not just the high street area, but high street primarily, because over the past several years, we've had a number of pedestrian accidents along that stretch of road.

427
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:41,646
[SPEAKER_16]: This evening in particular, Friday evening, it was a very sunny evening and that contributed to the crash factor that the investigating officers determined that there was some glare.

428
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:44,708
[SPEAKER_16]: The female operator of the vehicle said that it was sun glare.

429
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:48,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And the sun was going down, but it was still very sunny.

430
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:52,798
[SPEAKER_16]: They verified the fact that glare could have contributed to the, to the incident.

431
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:56,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, but very soon we'll have the time change and it'll be very dark again.

432
00:38:56,779 --> 00:39:00,961
[SPEAKER_16]: And even though we have those streetlights in the square, they're very dim.

433
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:07,463
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've had a number of accidents with people get off the commuter train and making their way home and trying to cross the street.

434
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:10,303
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will be stepping up enforcement in the area.

435
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:12,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I had an officer tell me yesterday,

436
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,877
[SPEAKER_16]: He was working the detail assignment.

437
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:19,799
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of confusion with all of the construction work going on on that stretch of road as well.

438
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:24,840
[SPEAKER_16]: The detail officer said he saw a young lady jogging across the street.

439
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,380
[SPEAKER_16]: She stopped at the crosswalk.

440
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,301
[SPEAKER_16]: She started across and a car went out and around her.

441
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:36,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if that vehicle was stopped or not, but driver attitude has a lot to do with things.

442
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:39,604
[SPEAKER_16]: They feel as though they have the right of way and they're not going to stop for anyone.

443
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,044
[SPEAKER_16]: I think if you look at,

444
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know many of you are up and about very early in the morning.

445
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:46,526
[SPEAKER_16]: You see the amount of traffic that this city holds.

446
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a tremendous amount.

447
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:54,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you look at the faces of a lot of the operators in these vehicles, there's a lot of frustration.

448
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,430
[SPEAKER_16]: They're late.

449
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,151
[SPEAKER_16]: They're rushing.

450
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:57,051
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to get through.

451
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:03,954
[SPEAKER_16]: And if the contractor has that Main Street, Craddock Bridge down to one lane, there's gridlock all over the place.

452
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:10,758
[SPEAKER_16]: One of these days, I'd like to ask the state police to take an aerial view of the gridlock that happens all over the city.

453
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:11,873
[SPEAKER_16]: in the morning.

454
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:22,097
[SPEAKER_16]: This morning, one of our traffic supervisors came in that said Riverside and Bradbury saying people aren't stopping at the stop sign up there on Bradbury coming across onto Riverside.

455
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:25,758
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about driver attitude.

456
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:26,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's in a hurry.

457
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,280
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to do the best we can to slow them down.

458
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:36,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Road construction, the raised crosswalk, the bumped out curvings, they may work.

459
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,103
[SPEAKER_16]: But Route 60, we'd have to get state approval.

460
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:40,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think you know from that.

461
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:44,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Our past efforts with the state, they're not always as helpful as they should be.

462
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:50,533
[SPEAKER_16]: When we try to create a truck route or a non truck route, uh, they kind of, uh, look the other way.

463
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:55,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Several years ago, we posted the speed limit all along high street at 20 miles per hour.

464
00:40:55,837 --> 00:41:01,321
[SPEAKER_16]: We received a phone call from mass highway saying, take the signs down or we'll be taking them down for you.

465
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:04,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, because we weren't authorized to post the speed limit.

466
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:10,067
[SPEAKER_16]: They did allow us to post the 20 mile per hour speed limit in the area of the schools.

467
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:13,075
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's all they would allow us to do.

468
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:18,678
[SPEAKER_16]: We were trying to put at 20 miles an hour the whole stretch of High Street, and that failed miserably.

469
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:26,463
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do need support, and I think we need support from our state delegation as well to make these things happen before we do have another tragedy out there.

470
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:32,687
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I just wanted to address a couple of those issues, and just to pledge that we will be out there doing more enforcement.

471
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,748
[SPEAKER_16]: We will be looking for the distracted driving.

472
00:41:35,228 --> 00:41:40,211
[SPEAKER_16]: We will be doing speed enforcement, and we will be definitely doing the crosswalk enforcement.

473
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,894
[SPEAKER_16]: as much as we possibly can.

474
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:44,896
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Chief.

475
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:54,203
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as seconded by Vice President Lago-Kern, and amended by Vice President Lago-Kern, Councilors Falco, Knight, and Marks.

476
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:55,444
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

477
00:41:55,464 --> 00:41:55,524
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

478
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:56,865
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

479
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:58,206
[SPEAKER_29]: The motion carries.

480
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:03,830
[SPEAKER_29]: The City Engineer, the motion has been disposed of.

481
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:07,993
[SPEAKER_29]: Anybody want to grant the City Engineer the indulgence?

482
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:09,174
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Engineer.

483
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,309
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry, I didn't move fast enough.

484
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,112
[SPEAKER_30]: Cassandra Cudelitas, 29 Crystal Street, Melrose.

485
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:22,477
[SPEAKER_30]: I wanted to come here tonight to give you an update on the work that we have been doing on Complete Streets.

486
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:29,402
[SPEAKER_30]: We have, since March, been working very hard on a policy statement, a prioritization plan.

487
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:36,528
[SPEAKER_30]: I hired, along with MAPC, a traffic consulting engineer who went out and looked at a number of locations

488
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:46,707
[SPEAKER_30]: And we prioritized, as I said, about 20 projects, of which the top seven and the top number one project is High Street at Brooks School.

489
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:55,253
[SPEAKER_30]: So that project does feature, as people in the audience have mentioned, as well as the chief, curb extensions, the narrowing of the road.

490
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,996
[SPEAKER_30]: It also looks at traffic beacons that pedestrians can push to slope.

491
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:05,358
[SPEAKER_30]: to alert traffic, oncoming traffic, in a rapid strobe-like fashion to slow them down.

492
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:15,703
[SPEAKER_30]: Better signage, better striping, this would all extend into West Medford Square as project number two, with more curb extensions and more ways to narrow the roadway, right of way.

493
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:20,626
[SPEAKER_30]: I am, personally, I'm appalled at the way that people drive in Medford, a lot of people.

494
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:27,450
[SPEAKER_30]: I was nearly run over myself about a month ago on Salem Street, as a parent, as somebody who is,

495
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,323
[SPEAKER_30]: hyper aware of all of these different traffic infractions.

496
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:33,804
[SPEAKER_30]: I took a photograph today of somebody who parked on the sidewalk.

497
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:35,345
[SPEAKER_30]: Can we send a ticket?

498
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,125
[SPEAKER_30]: I got the license plate number.

499
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:49,950
[SPEAKER_30]: I think we have to do something to address these issues of just rampant, out of control, impatient Boston area driving.

500
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:55,169
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just wanted to come here and tell you where we stand with the program.

501
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,249
[SPEAKER_30]: We just received the funding today.

502
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,811
[SPEAKER_30]: So that means that I can hire a designer to get going with the survey and the design.

503
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:03,511
[SPEAKER_30]: We are looking at short-term measures.

504
00:44:04,312 --> 00:44:05,472
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a meeting on Thursday.

505
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:19,437
[SPEAKER_30]: There are things that you can buy and put in place temporarily that we're looking at, ways to use these called tactical measures to create mock curb extensions for the time being, even to get the public used to it.

506
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:24,180
[SPEAKER_30]: ahead of time, because we're going to have to do the survey to locate everything.

507
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,900
[SPEAKER_30]: We have to make sure we don't create drainage problems with ponding.

508
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:30,442
[SPEAKER_30]: We have to pick the right kind of lights and make sure that they're set right.

509
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:31,602
[SPEAKER_30]: Glare is an issue.

510
00:44:32,162 --> 00:44:34,483
[SPEAKER_30]: All of you have experienced it, I'm sure, as drivers.

511
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:37,544
[SPEAKER_30]: And then we're doing six projects at once.

512
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,325
[SPEAKER_30]: We're also doing a study of Haynes Square.

513
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:40,425
[SPEAKER_30]: That's project number seven.

514
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:48,208
[SPEAKER_30]: So all these will be bundled by about the end of this calendar year, going out to bid for construction start in the early spring.

515
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mrs. Engineer.

516
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,468
[SPEAKER_29]: You're welcome.

517
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:00,651
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Vice President.

518
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:02,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you leave, Ms.

519
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:12,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Engineer, I don't know if Councilor Scarpelli was going to ask the same question as I. Is there any way you could just outline briefly number three, four, five, and six, just so we get an idea?

520
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,563
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you mentioned there's seven projects.

521
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:14,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

522
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,645
[SPEAKER_30]: Number three, Tufts Pool.

523
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,003
[SPEAKER_30]: and park Main Street at Medford Street.

524
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:21,824
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a dicey area to cross, as some of you may know.

525
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:32,787
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're looking to make a stop sign on Main Street, so traffic entering that merge on Main does not have to look over its left shoulder to see who's coming down Medford Street.

526
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:44,752
[SPEAKER_30]: We also want to take out that triangular parking area and make parallel parking, create an island that would serve as a refuge for people crossing the street, and install the flashing beacons as well.

527
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,492
[SPEAKER_30]: That's number three.

528
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:58,756
[SPEAKER_30]: Number four is Haines Square, but that's a study only for right now because the issues along the property line, the right-of-way, the parking lot, I think it's going to take a little more time to figure out, and we didn't want it to slow down this other work.

529
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,857
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's four, that's a study.

530
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:08,900
[SPEAKER_30]: Number five is Medford Square, Salem Street at Ashland and River, where I almost became a statistic if I hadn't backed up.

531
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,011
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's a curve extension, shortening of that crosswalk.

532
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:14,491
[SPEAKER_30]: It's three lanes, it's a very wide crossing.

533
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:18,413
[SPEAKER_30]: I see a number of people there struggling to get across, running sometimes.

534
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:21,674
[SPEAKER_30]: Project number six, Winthrop Circle at High Street.

535
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:33,977
[SPEAKER_30]: We are bringing Winthrop Circle up to standard for the manual and uniform traffic control, which means striping, signs, everything that's appropriate to have for a roundabout as it's currently configured.

536
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:36,598
[SPEAKER_30]: And also some improvements to the handicap ramps.

537
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:46,602
[SPEAKER_30]: We know that there's a larger issue around that location that could be addressed, such as what's the best placement for the circle, dealing with trucks, turning movements, and all of those things.

538
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:52,463
[SPEAKER_30]: But for the short term, it can be striped, it can be signed, so that it meets code.

539
00:46:53,283 --> 00:47:03,405
[SPEAKER_30]: And then finally, this Boston Avenue corridor from High Street to the Somerville line, it's the addition of a bike lane and share rows on the opposite side.

540
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

541
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,792
[SPEAKER_15]: And the funding we received today, can you tell us how much that was for?

542
00:47:10,812 --> 00:47:10,792
$400,000.

543
00:47:10,832 --> 00:47:11,432
[SPEAKER_30]: We got all of it.

544
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:16,014
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're one of 11 communities who have received it so far, so.

545
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:16,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

546
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:18,154
[SPEAKER_30]: We're out in front, yes.

547
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:25,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're working on, obviously, the designers for the long-term changes, but we're also working on some short-term.

548
00:47:25,837 --> 00:47:26,597
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, yes.

549
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:34,500
[SPEAKER_30]: I have calls into companies that provide portable devices and getting quotes from them, trying to see what would work there, what would be

550
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:35,491
[SPEAKER_30]: helpful.

551
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:36,692
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

552
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:37,132
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

553
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:37,872
[SPEAKER_30]: You're welcome.

554
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:38,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Scott.

555
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:40,893
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can just, just follow up with that.

556
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:46,635
[SPEAKER_10]: If we just have a copy of that, that, um, just more deep so we can follow along with the detail.

557
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:47,295
[SPEAKER_30]: Certainly.

558
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:48,996
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, my penmanship is awful.

559
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:51,416
[SPEAKER_10]: So the shorthand, I missed half of that.

560
00:47:51,476 --> 00:47:53,057
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can, thank you.

561
00:47:53,297 --> 00:47:54,777
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd be happy to appreciate it.

562
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:55,238
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

563
00:47:55,578 --> 00:48:02,060
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, madam, uh, engineer on the motion of council night to

564
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:05,283
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco.

565
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:11,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I was stopped by a resident on the way in tonight that would like to address the council.

566
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:12,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Gentleman, Mr. Poth here.

567
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:16,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

568
00:48:31,237 --> 00:48:31,577
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

569
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,238
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

570
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:34,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

571
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Eddie Poria.

572
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:40,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I was born in Medford a long, long time ago.

573
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 56 years old.

574
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just moved back to the Boston area after being down in Florida for 30 years.

575
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost my wife last year from cancer, and it was time to come home.

576
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:54,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thrilled to be back in the Boston area.

577
00:48:55,022 --> 00:48:55,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to tell you.

578
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:03,829
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was growing up, I never realized that Massachusetts was called Taxachusetts.

579
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that I'm back here, I kind of realize why.

580
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm frustrated.

581
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved to Florida in 1986.

582
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just moved back here a month ago.

583
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to do the right thing.

584
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:21,672
[SPEAKER_04]: The law says that you've got 10 days to come and change your license.

585
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went to go do my license.

586
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:29,526
[SPEAKER_04]: come to find out I owe some old bills, which I have no problem with.

587
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:36,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe nine years worth of excise taxes, which amounts to, I think it's $449.

588
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:40,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm disputing two years, the last two years.

589
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:47,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I'm disputing that is because I moved to Florida in 86, was pretty much down there forever.

590
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:51,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I did come home for six months after going back and

591
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,590
[SPEAKER_04]: looking back and forth at everything, I did come home and I bought a car.

592
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought that car without having the documents.

593
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:05,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I bought it in 88 and I moved back to Florida in 88 and I can prove that.

594
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a lease in my name

595
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:12,096
[SPEAKER_04]: in the year 1988, and I haven't been back since.

596
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the problem I have.

597
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I've called the mayor's office, waited a couple of weeks, and never got a call back from anyone in the mayor's office.

598
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:31,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I got a call from Ed O'Neill, who I think he's maybe in your tax department, real nice fellow, and he basically explained to me that

599
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:39,449
[SPEAKER_04]: What he needs from me is either a copy of the registration, copy of a bill of sale, or maybe something from the insurance company.

600
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a very reasonable request.

601
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's within five, maybe six, seven years.

602
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,331
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking 30 years.

603
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:54,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best I could do was, is I was able to produce my driver's license records going all the way back to 86.

604
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:56,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I show notations in 88.

605
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I show notations in 90.

606
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still licensed right now as we speak in Florida.

607
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:03,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to pay you guys.

608
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying really, really hard.

609
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:08,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And I come down here tonight.

610
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:09,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about $131.80.

611
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:11,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe the city $442.

612
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:12,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem paying you all's money.

613
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:13,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

614
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, and I'll ask, Mr. President, I'll ask you.

615
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't come up with these three things, and the state of Florida is telling me that before 1990, their records are horrible.

616
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:38,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They've asked me to fill a form out, and they told me they'll get back to me sometime after a couple of weeks.

617
00:51:38,907 --> 00:51:41,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been trying to work through their minds.

618
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I've reached out to a couple of the council members, and they've been very kind.

619
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,089
[SPEAKER_04]: They were good enough to return my call.

620
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:49,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just frustrated because I don't think that

621
00:51:54,676 --> 00:52:00,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize you all need to have your money, and I have no problem doing that, but I think that we're being a little bit unreasonable here.

622
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just trying to find a way to get through this.

623
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:17,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And, again, like I say, what you all are asking for, it's reasonable, but I'd like to challenge anybody in this room, if they could possibly produce for me their insurance, their registration,

624
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:21,540
[SPEAKER_04]: or their bill of sale from a car from 30 years ago.

625
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to do the right thing.

626
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to pay you guys.

627
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'm going crazy cause I feel like I'm being stonewalled and, um, I really don't know what to do.

628
00:52:32,226 --> 00:52:37,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided that maybe I'd come down here and speak to the council, ask you guys if there's anything you can do.

629
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,913
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's nothing you can do, maybe you can tell me whose head I can, who, who can, who else can I speak to?

630
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:49,413
[SPEAKER_04]: because I desperately want to pay you, but I got to tell you, I feel like you guys are

631
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

632
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:55,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I feel like you're really being greedy and being unreasonable.

633
00:52:55,613 --> 00:53:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, but I think that by producing my, my, all my license stuff and producing my lease from 1988 that I sent to the mayor's office, I don't know.

634
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a little bit surprised that didn't, that didn't warrant at least a phone call back.

635
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I just don't know what to do at this point.

636
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pleading for y'all's help or some advice to, to get through this.

637
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:26,169
[SPEAKER_29]: I think Councilman Knight will be able to point you in the right direction, but it seems to me that this is a matter for the Treasurer-Collector's Office.

638
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,532
[SPEAKER_22]: The Treasurer-Collector or the Assessor, Mr. President?

639
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:30,094
[SPEAKER_22]: The Assessor's Office.

640
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:36,121
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you might be able to petition the Assessor's Office for an abatement on the additional $132 in excise.

641
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:37,182
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that if you petition the

642
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:51,563
[SPEAKER_22]: board of assessors with requests for an abatement as well as a sworn affidavit saying that your location was Florida and that you disposed of the vehicle prior to you leaving the state, that that would be enough to get your foot in the door and you can make a case with the board of assessors.

643
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:53,264
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be my advice.

644
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, there's $311.19 that I know the city of Medford definitely could use.

645
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys could have had it a month ago.

646
00:54:03,171 --> 00:54:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I'm currently a courier and I'm breaking the law.

647
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:08,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little headstrong.

648
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:10,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been through a lot.

649
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:11,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been through a lot.

650
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:13,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been through a real lot.

651
00:54:13,694 --> 00:54:14,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been beaten down.

652
00:54:15,414 --> 00:54:16,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost everything.

653
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:16,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost my house.

654
00:54:17,014 --> 00:54:19,575
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I moved back is because I lost my house in foreclosure.

655
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:22,536
[SPEAKER_04]: But I lived in a street where 10 people died from cancer.

656
00:54:22,956 --> 00:54:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So leaving there and coming back, it's OK.

657
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:27,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK that I lost that house.

658
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:32,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want you all to be fair to me, and I think that what you just offered to me serves great.

659
00:54:32,597 --> 00:54:39,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shame that the mayor's office couldn't have been good enough to pass an information on, or even Ed O'Neill.

660
00:54:40,502 --> 00:54:42,244
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do thank you very much for that.

661
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:43,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there specific forms?

662
00:54:44,766 --> 00:54:45,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to call?

663
00:54:45,766 --> 00:54:46,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to go in the house?

664
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:50,230
[SPEAKER_22]: My advice would be to give Mr. O'Neill a call back, as the chairman of the Board of Assessors.

665
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,611
[SPEAKER_22]: He'll be able to point you in the right direction.

666
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:54,292
[SPEAKER_22]: If, in fact, they'll be willing to entertain an appeal for an abatement.

667
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,872
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll have to go back to the drawing board, but I think that's a good place to start.

668
00:54:58,272 --> 00:54:59,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd like to thank all of you for time.

669
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:00,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.

670
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:02,115
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have any questions or anything.

671
00:55:04,396 --> 00:55:07,418
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much for coming down and welcome back to Medford.

672
00:55:07,498 --> 00:55:11,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very glad to be here in spite of a little bit of muddy waters here.

673
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:12,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You all take care.

674
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:12,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

675
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:13,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

676
00:55:14,614 --> 00:55:17,335
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business.

677
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:18,556
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favour?

678
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:19,476
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

679
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:22,358
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

[SPEAKER_29]: Public hearing will be held.

00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:23,533
[SPEAKER_24]: I am not.

734
00:58:23,553 --> 00:58:24,494
[SPEAKER_24]: You're in opposition?

735
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:25,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I'm not.

736
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:26,315
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

737
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:29,716
[SPEAKER_29]: You can speak your reasons afterwards.

738
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:30,457
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

739
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:30,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

740
00:58:31,597 --> 00:58:32,998
[SPEAKER_29]: Anybody else in opposition?

741
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:38,240
[SPEAKER_29]: Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

742
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:41,682
[SPEAKER_29]: And we open it up to discussion, Chairman of Licensing Committee.

743
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:44,483
[SPEAKER_29]: But we just vote on non-objection, right?

744
00:58:45,724 --> 00:58:46,604
[SPEAKER_29]: No, this is a special permit.

745
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,165
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a special permit?

746
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:48,485
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

747
00:58:49,566 --> 00:58:50,406
[SPEAKER_29]: Who's Chairman of Zoning?

748
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:50,946
[SPEAKER_29]: Ricky?

749
00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:55,419
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

750
00:58:55,759 --> 00:59:01,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to the petitioner as well as the gentleman who came up to speak in opposition.

751
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:04,686
[SPEAKER_22]: After a view of the papers, all the paperwork does appear to be in order.

752
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:17,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, as we've noted that this is an issue that requires a special permit, I personally feel as though we don't have a need for any kino monitors in our convenience stores and I'd like to be recorded in opposition.

753
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:19,478
[SPEAKER_22]: However, the paperwork is complete.

754
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:21,420
[SPEAKER_22]: I see no problem with the paperwork.

755
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,161
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a philosophical

756
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,458
[SPEAKER_22]: issue for me, Mr. President, not a matter of public process or procedure.

757
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:37,965
[SPEAKER_22]: So, with that being said, I'd move for approval on the papers, but I'd like to be reported in opposition because I feel as though we have enough keynote monitors in our convenience stores as it is right now.

758
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:39,186
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

759
00:59:39,586 --> 00:59:42,448
[SPEAKER_29]: So, Councilor Knight moves approval.

760
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:45,290
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lago-Kern.

761
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Ruza.

762
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:50,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask the same question you just asked the city clerk.

763
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:52,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought we voted to

764
00:59:53,628 --> 01:00:15,199
[SPEAKER_27]: not object or to object, usually it's... I think that was done prior and then we made the petitioner, he didn't object, but made the petitioner, alerted the petitioner that he needed a special permit.

765
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,761
[SPEAKER_27]: So it was a prior meeting, he didn't object.

766
01:00:21,627 --> 01:00:24,449
[SPEAKER_27]: but you can't proceed until he gets it.

767
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:25,890
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

768
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:32,594
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could hear from the residents that are, well, for, for, I know the petitioners are for it.

769
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:35,256
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could hear from the people that are against it.

770
01:00:35,276 --> 01:00:41,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I've received emails and phone calls with people in, um, who are against it as well.

771
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,941
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to kind of hear it out and see.

772
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:45,583
[SPEAKER_29]: The chair will recognize the petitioner.

773
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:55,293
[SPEAKER_29]: Your reasons for wanting this special permit?

774
01:00:56,474 --> 01:01:01,836
[SPEAKER_11]: The reasons for this is this is a common Keno license.

775
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:09,340
[SPEAKER_11]: The state lottery gives out to the agents who are qualified to get the Keno permit.

776
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And that reason, they give us the permission to get the Keno license.

777
01:01:15,023 --> 01:01:18,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the reason we applied for the Keno license.

778
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:23,545
[SPEAKER_29]: Chairman Knight?

779
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:29,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Does the gentleman have the ability to sell Kino right now, absent the monitor?

780
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:30,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

781
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:31,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

782
01:01:31,509 --> 01:01:32,229
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

783
01:01:36,991 --> 01:01:37,252
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam?

784
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:39,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe somebody wanted to speak.

785
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:40,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody else?

786
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:44,035
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

787
01:01:44,595 --> 01:01:46,996
[SPEAKER_33]: I've been a manager at the store for quite some time.

788
01:01:47,296 --> 01:01:48,597
[SPEAKER_33]: I've always helped my cousins out.

789
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:51,598
[SPEAKER_33]: Since at the age of 13, I've been filling coolers and stuff.

790
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:53,342
[SPEAKER_33]: I've always been at the store.

791
01:01:53,802 --> 01:01:58,707
[SPEAKER_33]: This is where we're started, and this is the initiative store that we've always been a part of.

792
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:01,329
[SPEAKER_33]: I went to McLean myself, as well as Medford Eye.

793
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:12,680
[SPEAKER_33]: I've always been part of this community, and I agree that the other places do have kino stores, which I don't understand why I may not have the same rights as someone else does.

794
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,300
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may, Mr. President, it's a special permit issue.

795
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:29,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever permits were granted before I came on the council that I have no control or knowledge of, however, since I've been on this board, I've consistently voted against Keno monitors and convenience stores because I feel like it takes the convenience out of convenience stores.

796
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:33,543
[SPEAKER_22]: You go there for milk, you got to wait in line for people to play Keno, people are standing around loitering.

797
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,584
[SPEAKER_22]: It just gives a bad feel for the neighborhood, Mr. President.

798
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:36,904
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a philosophical thing.

799
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:38,164
[SPEAKER_22]: It's nothing to do with the individual.

800
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:39,424
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that they run a great business.

801
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,625
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very familiar with the business.

802
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:43,225
[SPEAKER_22]: I was very familiar with Dan's convenience before they took over.

803
01:02:44,128 --> 01:03:01,278
[SPEAKER_33]: I just philosophically oppose keynote monitors that I can be in the stores Thank you So to oppose that distraction and keep the convenience we actually have two keynote machines so one is towards the side of the end of the store where the customers can watch and

804
01:03:01,897 --> 01:03:04,978
[SPEAKER_33]: and play the keynote aside from the convenience side.

805
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:10,019
[SPEAKER_33]: So anyone that wants to come in and out, grab milk, water, paper, they're more than welcome to.

806
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,139
[SPEAKER_33]: So that should not distract whatsoever.

807
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:17,680
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've also provided a layout up the store as well of how it's going to be set up.

808
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:26,102
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that the application, Mr. President, indicated that that layout was still required by, I believe, our building department to take a look at before.

809
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:30,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we need a plot plan for the special permit through the city clerk's office.

810
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,428
[SPEAKER_22]: City clerk's application from the building commissioner.

811
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,651
[SPEAKER_22]: So that plug plan does need to be submitted to the building commissioner.

812
01:03:36,032 --> 01:03:37,053
[SPEAKER_22]: We have submitted it.

813
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:37,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

814
01:03:37,874 --> 01:03:38,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything has been submitted.

815
01:03:45,664 --> 01:03:45,984
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

816
01:03:46,565 --> 01:03:48,868
[SPEAKER_29]: There was somebody in opposition who wanted to speak.

817
01:03:53,058 --> 01:03:55,600
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome, please state your name and address for the record again, thank you.

818
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:00,123
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, again, Ernest Muneer, 24 Newton Road in West Medford.

819
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:19,716
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been a resident there 30 plus years, and I don't wanna get into the nuances about whether or not having a gambling related establishment or part thereof in the neighborhood is philosophically a good idea.

820
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:22,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanna talk about public safety.

821
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:48,921
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is that, well, as an example, as part of the complete streets project that Cassandra related to, I spent a few afternoons in the last two years doing pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle monitoring at that intersection of Sagamore, Boston, that's a continuous straight line, and High Street.

822
01:04:50,882 --> 01:05:09,236
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to the fact that I live in that neighborhood and cross that intersection, perhaps 20 or 30 times a week, I've noticed the difficulty and I'm here to prevent the next serious accident.

823
01:05:09,396 --> 01:05:15,941
[SPEAKER_24]: As everyone knows, continuing through High Street at that bend is a snaking operation.

824
01:05:17,342 --> 01:05:19,063
[SPEAKER_24]: Parking is allowed on both sides.

825
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:50,215
[SPEAKER_24]: people coming westbound toward Arlington Center who want to stop at this and do business at this convenience store stop blocking the intersection to traffic on Sagamore and almost always within the 20 feet distance told to me by the chief of the DPW.

826
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:54,897
[SPEAKER_24]: that's required to stay away from an intersection.

827
01:05:55,818 --> 01:06:11,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Those of us who come down Sagamore and have to turn right onto high street are often blocked from doing so by cars parked on the corner or even double parked on the corner, blocking the road itself.

828
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:18,631
[SPEAKER_24]: I've encountered cars who are there empty, idling, running to the convenience store,

829
01:06:19,202 --> 01:06:23,724
[SPEAKER_24]: and more often than not, come out without anything visible.

830
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:32,487
[SPEAKER_24]: It means they're not buying milk or potatoes or bananas, they're buying cigarettes and playing with Keno.

831
01:06:33,107 --> 01:06:42,290
[SPEAKER_24]: This was a shocking bit of truth that I discovered watching traffic in this area.

832
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,091
[SPEAKER_24]: The city has

833
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:52,150
[SPEAKER_24]: Originally 20, 30 years ago, bad intersections, curb stones were marked yellow.

834
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:56,131
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the paint is long faded.

835
01:06:56,671 --> 01:07:00,573
[SPEAKER_24]: They're fully weeded and there's no signage.

836
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:10,176
[SPEAKER_24]: I went to the DPW meeting last week by coincidence, unrelated to this petition to state that this is a mess.

837
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:33,339
[SPEAKER_24]: that people are going to be hurt here and the difficulty involved, that the intersection should be cleaned up and signs have to be put up simply saying no parking to corner, both on the Sagamore, Boston Avenue and high street sides of the corner.

838
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:40,180
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that as a prerequisite, and the curbstone should be painted yellow,

839
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:58,002
[SPEAKER_24]: as a prerequisite to allowing the increase of traffic to establishments on this corner, particularly the convenience store whose clients seem to be most transient, not walk-ins from the neighborhood.

840
01:07:58,382 --> 01:08:00,924
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a convenient neighborhood store.

841
01:08:01,605 --> 01:08:07,690
[SPEAKER_24]: It's for people passing through to buy cigarettes and play gambling games.

842
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,550
[SPEAKER_24]: That, I believe, is the predominant nature of their business.

843
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:29,446
[SPEAKER_24]: At least if we decide philosophically to allow that to continue, we have to at least post the signs on the intersection prohibiting parking in the middle of the intersection, on all eight curves of the four-way intersection.

844
01:08:30,571 --> 01:08:40,151
[SPEAKER_24]: I would like to see the cleanup of that intersection and proper postage and marking as a prerequisite to the granting of any extended license.

845
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:41,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

846
01:08:46,228 --> 01:08:46,769
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, sir.

847
01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:50,091
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a motion for approval.

848
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:55,917
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may, I'd like at least another week.

849
01:08:55,997 --> 01:09:05,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I had discussed this with a few other residents that were not able to attend tonight, and I'm not sure if they reached out to the rest of the council, but I'd like to just kind of get more.

850
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:09,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I told them that we usually don't that we usually vote to approve.

851
01:09:11,658 --> 01:09:14,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure they get the correct information that this is before us.

852
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:18,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I'd like to table this motion to table.

853
01:09:20,065 --> 01:09:20,245
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

854
01:09:20,546 --> 01:09:21,246
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam vice president.

855
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:21,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

856
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:24,609
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion to table on debatable.

857
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:27,191
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure.

858
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:30,834
[SPEAKER_29]: Recognize this council Scarpelli for requests to suspend the rules.

859
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:36,299
[SPEAKER_10]: 16, six, seven, four, six, seven, five, and six, seven, six, please.

860
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:44,848
[SPEAKER_29]: on the motion for suspension of the rules to take communications from the mayor.

861
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:45,968
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

862
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:46,968
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

863
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,689
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

864
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:58,931
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-674, to Council President Dello Russo and members of the Medford City Council, from Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor, reloan order, City Hall roof facade improvements.

865
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:05,012
[SPEAKER_29]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following

866
01:10:06,306 --> 01:10:33,629
[SPEAKER_29]: City of Medford, Massachusetts loan order for City Hall roof facade improvements, municipal facility, be it ordered that the sum of $1,800,000 be and hereby is appointed, appropriated to pay costs of demolishing and reconstructing the roof and facade of Medford City Hall and all pertinences, uh, there too, including the payment of all costs, incidental and related there too,

867
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:54,071
[SPEAKER_29]: And that to raise this appropriation, the city treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow to set some under and pursuant to chapter 44, section 7, 3A of the Massachusetts general laws as amended and supplemented or pursuant to any other enabling authority and to issue bonds or notes of the city therefore.

868
01:10:54,498 --> 01:11:22,725
[SPEAKER_29]: and further order that the city treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Municipal Finance Oversight Board to qualify under Chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds or notes of the city authorized by this vote or pursuant to any prior vote of the city and in connection therewith to provide such information and execute such documents as the Municipal Finance Oversight Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require.

869
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:25,977
[SPEAKER_29]: and Sincerely Yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

870
01:11:26,618 --> 01:11:33,323
[SPEAKER_29]: Here with us tonight to present on the matter is the Building Commissioner of the City of Medford, Paul Mokey.

871
01:11:44,771 --> 01:11:46,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Council.

872
01:11:47,373 --> 01:11:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: As stated in your remarks, we have

873
01:11:50,701 --> 01:12:03,509
[SPEAKER_06]: had a bid opening already earlier this month for the first of three phases of the City Hall renovations, which is the roof repair, parapet wall replacement, and cupola restoration.

874
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:19,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And earlier today, the Procurement Office emailed out the notice of award and the contract to the low bidder, and we are hoping that if he processes that in a timely manner and all his paperwork is in order, we're hoping that that work

875
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:22,546
[SPEAKER_06]: sometime on the middle of October would begin.

876
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:32,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, uh, when you're doing any type of roofing work, that's going to be dependent on the weather, but we're hoping to get the roof weather tight, uh, before the snow starts to fly.

877
01:12:33,275 --> 01:12:34,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first phase of the project.

878
01:12:34,936 --> 01:12:36,057
[SPEAKER_06]: There were two other phases.

879
01:12:36,077 --> 01:12:39,680
[SPEAKER_06]: The second phase would be the renovation of the council chambers.

880
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:48,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously where there's some roof issues, we want to have to, um, make sure that the, uh, the roof is completed and the weather tight before we would do

881
01:12:49,107 --> 01:13:01,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That phase of the construction, that's currently, the bid documents are currently in the process of being prepared, and we're hoping sometime at the end of this month, beginning of next month, that we would get the bid, have the bid opening for that.

882
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:11,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third phase, which would be the front entry, new doors to the front entry, front entry renovations would be done sometime in the spring.

883
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:17,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, there's also James Barr, one of the principals of Russo Barr Engineering Firm is here.

884
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:30,123
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in the process now of preparing all the bid specs and documents for that, and we're hoping sometime the end of October, the beginning of November, that we would have a bid opening for the third phase of that construction.

885
01:13:31,484 --> 01:13:35,005
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

886
01:13:35,385 --> 01:13:36,905
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

887
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:40,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Mulkey, for being here this evening.

888
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:43,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate moving forward with this.

889
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that many residents have talked about the

890
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:54,440
[SPEAKER_10]: the jewel of our community, the center of our community being the piece that people look at and start to judge who we are as a community.

891
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:04,386
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy this is moving forward, but one of the, I know that if you can, if there's a way that we addressing one of the biggest concerns is also the bathrooms.

892
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:09,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there motion, is there movement in what we're doing for the restrooms here?

893
01:14:10,169 --> 01:14:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

894
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:10,910
[SPEAKER_10]: We've,

895
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,603
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the on-call contractor, Irving Plumbing Associates.

896
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:25,549
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had him in here at the beginning of the summer to do a report to a walkthrough of all the bathrooms with us.

897
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:30,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we have some prices to do that.

898
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:34,635
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm having him brought back in again, because one of the issues

899
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:58,351
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're facing, and I'm sure you can appreciate any 80-year-old building, the water lines here that's so old that we're trying to, we're looking into alternatives, maybe putting some new lines so we can isolate each floor of the building so that when we do some repairs such as this, we don't have to kill the building, and that would also help us with some of the fixtures that are in there.

900
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping sometime before the end of this month to get him back in here, but that is being addressed.

901
01:15:05,257 --> 01:15:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of code issues we're looking into that, but hopefully within the next month we'll have some definitive numbers and a plan to move forward on that.

902
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,902
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

903
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:16,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

904
01:15:16,222 --> 01:15:16,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

905
01:15:20,324 --> 01:15:20,704
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know.

906
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:21,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously.

907
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,205
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight.

908
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:24,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

909
01:15:24,946 --> 01:15:26,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

910
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:27,927
[SPEAKER_22]: And Mr. Moki, thank you for your presentation.

911
01:15:27,947 --> 01:15:29,328
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it was a rather thorough.

912
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:37,224
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my recollection that this council has appropriated funds in the past to make sure that the roof was weathertight to get it through the winter.

913
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:38,384
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we did that last winter.

914
01:15:38,424 --> 01:15:41,046
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we might've done it the winter before as well, if I remember correctly.

915
01:15:42,347 --> 01:15:51,094
[SPEAKER_22]: We've appropriated some funds so that we maintain that the roof is in safe water until we could get a paper like this before us so that we could go and get to work, if I recall correctly.

916
01:15:51,683 --> 01:16:03,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we've done some work in the last several years and with the anticipation to, um, you know, make it secure whichever way we can with, we knew this, uh, major renovations was coming.

917
01:16:04,046 --> 01:16:10,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't want to put a lot of money into it, whether we'd have to, you know, a year or two down the road, rip up and do the whole thing over.

918
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did what we felt was necessary to make it, to make the wall secure and also to address any leaks that we were experiencing at the time.

919
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:25,910
[SPEAKER_22]: And with the approval of this paper, you feel as though you'll be able to get the construction work started out there in the next, looks like, what, 30 days' time almost.

920
01:16:26,784 --> 01:16:35,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, well, I had a discussion with Mr. Russo earlier tonight, and fortunately, the low bidder is a contractor he's had experience with and he's familiar with.

921
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:42,652
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, the notice of award in the contract was emailed earlier today.

922
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:55,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We're planning on doing a follow-up call with him tomorrow to emphasize the urgency of getting this done, and we're hoping that he's going to be cooperative, as we think he will, and really willing to get on this as soon as possible, of course.

923
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,462
[SPEAKER_22]: And soup to nuts, Mr. Moki.

924
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:03,505
[SPEAKER_22]: We're looking at this project starting and how long do you think phase one will take to complete.

925
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:16,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, phase one, which of course is making the roof weather tight, we're hoping, I said the middle of October, we're actually hoping, trying to get them a little bit earlier than that, but I'm trying to be a little realistic with the schedule too.

926
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:21,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want that, we're really hoping to get that weather tight before the snow flies.

927
01:17:21,406 --> 01:17:27,687
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the whole wall of wax, the completion day of the project is next June 30th for everything.

928
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:28,787
[SPEAKER_22]: We're at the close of the fiscal year.

929
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:29,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, excellent.

930
01:17:29,908 --> 01:17:30,368
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

931
01:17:30,388 --> 01:17:31,468
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate your time.

932
01:17:36,221 --> 01:17:36,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco.

933
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:38,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

934
01:17:38,623 --> 01:17:40,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Moki, for your report.

935
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:43,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I, too, am very happy to see this project.

936
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:46,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Very happy to see it getting started.

937
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, for many people that don't live here, they might come here to do business.

938
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:54,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people, of course, that live here come here to do business.

939
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:57,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sends a message how we treat this building.

940
01:17:57,835 --> 01:17:59,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It sends a message to the community about what we're about.

941
01:18:03,302 --> 01:18:05,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question about the parapet up top.

942
01:18:05,103 --> 01:18:08,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that going to basically, when it's replaced, is it going to look the same?

943
01:18:08,946 --> 01:18:09,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

944
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:12,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We were very sensitive to that fact.

945
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:13,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it to look exactly the same.

946
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:30,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we've, in our pre-bid construction meetings with Russell Bioengineering and also our site visits with the contractors, and it was clearly specified in the construction documents and bid specifications that we are going to, we want an exact match of what's out there.

947
01:18:30,942 --> 01:18:31,762
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, we,

948
01:18:32,983 --> 01:18:48,131
[SPEAKER_06]: in one of the areas, in an interior corner where one of the balustrades was loose, we saw it, kind of took it out, so they literally had an exact, it wasn't an exact replica, they had the exact piece of the balustrade, so they were able to match that very precisely.

949
01:18:48,151 --> 01:18:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as, right now I believe,

950
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:54,539
[SPEAKER_03]: with the type of material right now is concrete that's up there.

951
01:18:54,799 --> 01:18:57,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to be concrete or is that going to be another material?

952
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,581
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's going to be a polymer mix.

953
01:18:58,841 --> 01:18:59,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's polyvinyl.

954
01:19:00,021 --> 01:19:02,462
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to look very similar to concrete.

955
01:19:02,482 --> 01:19:06,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have a finish on it which matches the textured finish that's up there now also.

956
01:19:06,983 --> 01:19:09,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be a very close match.

957
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:15,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, before anything is finalized, we're going to have different samples to pick from.

958
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:16,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was, again, something we

959
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very sensitive to the historic nature of this building, and we're working very hard with the manufacturers and the engineering firm to make sure that's a very precise match up there.

960
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And I assume that the polyvinyl probably holds up longer and more weather-resistant?

961
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:32,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's much more durable.

962
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more cost-effective.

963
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:44,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as the construction process, it's a lot better to assemble that on the roof as opposed to the old piece of old concrete that was up there before.

964
01:19:44,772 --> 01:19:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

965
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:46,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

966
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:48,603
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Caraviello.

967
01:19:48,863 --> 01:19:49,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

968
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:56,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, um, long overdue, uh, as you can see, you know, since in my five years here, I've seen the roof fall down on people.

969
01:19:57,186 --> 01:19:58,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, luckily not hurt somebody one day.

970
01:19:59,267 --> 01:20:10,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we see a leaking on the walls over there, but, uh, I'm glad that, you know, we're keeping the historical, uh, look of the building and, um, I support this, uh, motion, uh, wholeheartedly and let's get started.

971
01:20:10,671 --> 01:20:11,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

972
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:14,452
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair awaits a motion.

973
01:20:14,953 --> 01:20:15,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval.

974
01:20:15,553 --> 01:20:15,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

975
01:20:16,256 --> 01:20:19,357
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

976
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:21,477
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

977
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:24,938
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

978
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

979
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:40,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Just briefly, before us tonight in the three papers is money to be taken out of free cash, a request for $1.2 million out of free cash, $1.8 million in bond, and $45,000, I believe another $45,000 out of free cash.

980
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:40,563
[SPEAKER_15]: That's $3,045,000.

981
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:51,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just ask that we have a committee of the whole meeting and invite the mayor to sit down with us.

982
01:20:51,878 --> 01:20:59,625
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's important to go over these three projects in a little bit more detail because each one of them didn't come with more than a paragraph or two.

983
01:20:59,645 --> 01:21:03,289
[SPEAKER_15]: And also— Point of information, Councilor Knight.

984
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:19,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

985
01:21:25,317 --> 01:21:27,378
[SPEAKER_15]: However much money it is, it's millions of dollars.

986
01:21:27,518 --> 01:21:36,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also have requested a number of times, including in our June meetings, budget meetings, that we sit down and we've requested multiple times, I think,

987
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:45,606
[SPEAKER_15]: not only to see what the budget's going on a month-to-month basis, but also that we see what the capital improvement plan that the mayor's putting forward, what it's going to look like.

988
01:21:45,786 --> 01:21:48,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe there was a rough draft of it done in August.

989
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:49,788
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked to see the rough draft.

990
01:21:49,828 --> 01:21:51,689
[SPEAKER_15]: We weren't apprised to it, which is fine.

991
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Supposedly, it's coming out within the next couple weeks.

992
01:21:54,851 --> 01:22:03,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's important that we sit down and we meet with regards to a number of different projects that we've all asked for and we all want done and projects that do need to be done.

993
01:22:03,997 --> 01:22:06,739
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're talking multimillion-dollar projects.

994
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:13,112
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody's walked through the police station, I mean, I, as one councilor, want to see where we are with that.

995
01:22:13,212 --> 01:22:27,903
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we're not going to do it in its entirety for millions and millions of dollars, then we need to make sure that within this capital improvement plan, there are monies in there to redo portions of that police station that need to be desperately done.

996
01:22:28,364 --> 01:22:32,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in recently, and it's filthy.

997
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:36,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't believe we are allowing our men and women to operate in such

998
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:38,123
[SPEAKER_15]: terrible conditions.

999
01:22:38,643 --> 01:22:46,067
[SPEAKER_15]: So that, along with the library roof, along with city hall roof, I think it's something that we need to sit down, even if it's an hour, an hour and a half meeting.

1000
01:22:46,387 --> 01:22:51,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do it next Tuesday before our meeting, city council meeting.

1001
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:56,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's important we as a council get apprised of what is coming forward.

1002
01:22:56,873 --> 01:22:58,954
[SPEAKER_15]: How many millions are we going to go out to bond for?

1003
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:02,776
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we going to take from free cash over the next six months?

1004
01:23:03,156 --> 01:23:06,878
[SPEAKER_15]: And how are we going to move forward rather than, you know, obviously,

1005
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:09,038
[SPEAKER_15]: piecemeal a little at a time.

1006
01:23:09,078 --> 01:23:09,959
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're owed that.

1007
01:23:09,979 --> 01:23:19,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we owe the citizens to be able to say, we're going to expend and go out to bond for 10, 12, 14 million dollars in the next year, and this is why, this is what it's for.

1008
01:23:20,346 --> 01:23:26,490
[SPEAKER_15]: But right now we just have, you know, the one before us, and I think it's extremely important we get to see the big picture.

1009
01:23:26,931 --> 01:23:33,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether that's seven days, I don't think it's going to, you know, be detrimental to this project, but I think that it's something that

1010
01:23:33,431 --> 01:23:42,058
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we deserve answers to, and I don't think we're going to get the answers anytime soon unless we, you know, obviously hold up the paper and demand the answers.

1011
01:23:42,398 --> 01:23:46,581
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just my opinion, and I understand this needs to be moved forward.

1012
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:49,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Most Councilors want this to move forward.

1013
01:23:49,103 --> 01:23:55,227
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the seven of us do, but I truly believe that we need to sit down and discuss it as a whole.

1014
01:23:55,868 --> 01:23:59,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Capital Improvement Plan, we've been asking for it for many months now.

1015
01:23:59,551 --> 01:24:00,011
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time.

1016
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:01,012
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time.

1017
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:06,716
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval by council Caraviello, seconded by councilor night chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1018
01:24:07,656 --> 01:24:08,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1019
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:14,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all of us behind this reeling realized the need for repairs to this particular building.

1020
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:27,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I know councilor Scarpelli brought up an issue that's near and dear to me about the, uh, which I refer to him as prison restrooms we have, uh, within this building here that are in deplorable condition.

1021
01:24:27,546 --> 01:24:30,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So I too would like to see a total plan.

1022
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was under the impression after budget deliberations that we were gonna be seeing the mayor's capital improvement plan sometime in September and October.

1023
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, that would give me a better vision of what the future's gonna bring, rather than having it come before us piecemeal.

1024
01:24:48,243 --> 01:24:54,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We all realize the parapet and the exterior of the building is in tough condition.

1025
01:24:54,765 --> 01:24:58,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember some years back, and some of the councilors were on at the time,

1026
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:09,812
[SPEAKER_07]: that any spending paper that was before this council, we voted as a council to have it appear, not the first time on the council floor, but at a committee of the whole meeting.

1027
01:25:10,253 --> 01:25:13,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can sit down with the department heads, we can sit down with the mayor.

1028
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,789
[SPEAKER_07]: and discuss the need for the spending.

1029
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why we got away from that, but now we're seeing multimillion dollar items appear on the council floor for the first time without any committee of the whole meetings.

1030
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:31,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, I, I prefer, uh, the ladder.

1031
01:25:31,118 --> 01:25:35,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I prefer committee of the whole meetings, uh, and, uh, discussion.

1032
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:53,455
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we received a paper stating what's gonna be done, and the paper we received from the mayor's office, it goes on to say phase two will be a bid in the spring for internal work in the council chambers, external work such as front entrance doors, et cetera.

1033
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:56,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if I was gonna do work in my house,

1034
01:25:57,459 --> 01:26:03,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went to the contractor and said, what are you going to do for this $50,000 I've given you?

1035
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,941
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, well, I'm going to replace your windows, et cetera, et cetera.

1036
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say, wait a minute.

1037
01:26:08,741 --> 01:26:09,982
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what does et cetera mean?

1038
01:26:10,442 --> 01:26:12,042
[SPEAKER_07]: What's actually involved?

1039
01:26:12,302 --> 01:26:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we getting for our dollar?

1040
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:19,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this needs to be vetted personally, Mr. President, and the committee, the whole meeting.

1041
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:26,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone behind this reel doesn't think this is well overdue.

1042
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:34,313
[SPEAKER_07]: As we know, the city for many years neglected its buildings and its infrastructure without having proper maintenance.

1043
01:26:34,733 --> 01:26:41,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just respectfully ask that this be laid on the table until we have a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1044
01:26:42,457 --> 01:26:54,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'm sure you can set that up next week and we can discuss this further, as well as any other capital improvements we heard about the woman's locker room at the police station.

1045
01:26:55,242 --> 01:26:56,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about that a dozen times.

1046
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I've yet to see that.

1047
01:26:58,107 --> 01:27:05,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a cost of the estimates that I've heard, half a million dollars to add a woman locker room.

1048
01:27:05,776 --> 01:27:06,536
[SPEAKER_07]: in the police station.

1049
01:27:06,816 --> 01:27:11,797
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a number of issues that we were told during budget that don't worry about them during budget.

1050
01:27:12,077 --> 01:27:14,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be part of the mayor's capital improvement plan.

1051
01:27:14,658 --> 01:27:17,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we really need to sit down, Mr. President, as a council.

1052
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:27,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've been around for a little while, and I refuse to get things piecemeal like the city worked for many, many years under the past administration.

1053
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:34,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's only appropriate that we're the stewards of the taxpayers' money.

1054
01:27:35,034 --> 01:27:37,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an easy fix just to approve everything.

1055
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,898
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we have to do our homework and our due diligence on this.

1056
01:27:41,558 --> 01:27:45,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I don't think it hurts anyone to have a committee, the whole meeting on this.

1057
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,322
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, was that a motion?

1058
01:27:47,922 --> 01:27:48,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it would be a motion.

1059
01:27:48,883 --> 01:27:56,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, motion to table matter is tabled committee, the whole meeting.

1060
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:57,788
[SPEAKER_07]: That was part of the motion.

1061
01:27:57,808 --> 01:27:58,769
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-six 75.

1062
01:28:02,506 --> 01:28:21,178
[SPEAKER_29]: To the Honorable President, to the members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and City Councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $45,000 for the purpose of providing necessary repairs to the library roof.

1063
01:28:21,979 --> 01:28:25,741
[SPEAKER_29]: As you are aware, the building committee for the libraries in the process of preparing

1064
01:28:26,424 --> 01:28:29,505
[SPEAKER_29]: comprehensive application for building improvements.

1065
01:28:30,065 --> 01:28:35,067
[SPEAKER_29]: An engineering report was prepared by Russo bar detailing the options.

1066
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:39,569
[SPEAKER_29]: The balance and certified free cash prior to this vote is $8,187,775.

1067
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:43,791
[SPEAKER_29]: The building commissioner, Paul Moki will be present to answer any questions you may have.

1068
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,031
[SPEAKER_29]: Sincerely, Stephanie M Burke mayor.

1069
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:45,812
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Moki.

1070
01:29:05,764 --> 01:29:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1071
01:29:06,805 --> 01:29:25,943
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know that we also commissioned Russo bar to do a two studies at the library and existing conditions report of the existing roof and a feasibility study to, uh, for the possibility of putting a second floor addition on and the, uh, to address the roof portion of that study first, um,

1072
01:29:26,932 --> 01:29:34,064
[SPEAKER_06]: It was determined that there were three layers on the existing roof in the library, and that it's over 20 years old.

1073
01:29:34,164 --> 01:29:37,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in pretty tough shape, and the recommendation in the long run

1074
01:29:38,126 --> 01:29:56,181
[SPEAKER_06]: is to strip those three layers and put a new roof on, and that would also encompass other facets of the roof repair, which would be there's some through-wall flashing, the drains are not clogged, not working properly, and some of the vent stacks need to be renovated to be brought up to code.

1075
01:29:57,121 --> 01:30:03,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the one recommendation would be to strip the whole roof, do those repairs and renovations, and we'd have a whole new roofing system.

1076
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:21,207
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, which ties in with this first project, there was also a study done on the feasibility of putting a second floor on the library, and that report came back that in order to construct a second floor,

1077
01:30:21,887 --> 01:30:32,894
[SPEAKER_06]: We would have to upgrade the structural system in particular of that building because when that was built in the late 50s, there was no mass state building code and no seismic requirements that were really addressed.

1078
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:42,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the issues in doing a project of this nature is in the existing building code, you have to upgrade all the structural systems for seismic loads.

1079
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:50,524
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one of the recommendations they made that based on their studies, their preliminary studies, there'll be a lot of structural work need to be done for an addition.

1080
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:58,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Having taken that into account, they also gave us another option as opposed to stripping the new roof.

1081
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: If the decision is to go with an addition instead of putting a whole new roof that may only be having to take out in a few years, they gave us an option to perform some repairs.

1082
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:18,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And the option for the repairs would range from $35,000 to $45,000 to go up there and do various repairs to make everything weathertight.

1083
01:31:18,859 --> 01:31:20,621
[SPEAKER_06]: as opposed to a whole new roofing system.

1084
01:31:20,661 --> 01:31:24,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we're in the process of getting bids to do that work.

1085
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:45,362
[SPEAKER_22]: So at this point in time, Mr. Mulkey, it would be the recommendation of the administration that we move forward to repair the roof and take further look at the seismic requirements in the state building code that might allow us to expand the building, as I understand it.

1086
01:31:46,117 --> 01:31:53,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, right now I've been instructed to get the three quotes, and I'm not really sure the immediate plan for the addition or for the seismic study.

1087
01:31:53,684 --> 01:31:55,785
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still in the process of discussing that.

1088
01:31:57,947 --> 01:32:09,317
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a possibility that we could expend $35,000 to $45,000 this evening for repair work to the roof that ultimately will need to be replaced in the future if the addition doesn't go as...

1089
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:12,066
[SPEAKER_22]: discussed or planned?

1090
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:15,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that's what we're still in the process of trying to make that determination.

1091
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we don't want to spend that money if it's only going to get us a few years.

1092
01:32:21,689 --> 01:32:26,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to, of course, make the roof weather tight, which we have done recently.

1093
01:32:26,191 --> 01:32:37,875
[SPEAKER_06]: But upon further investigation by the Russo Bar, there were a lot of underlying factors which may need some immediate addressing also.

1094
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1095
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:39,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1096
01:32:43,468 --> 01:32:44,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Mr. President.

1097
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:46,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I ask that we approve this money this evening.

1098
01:32:48,733 --> 01:33:07,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I am on the library building committee and the group is working very hard to get the first part of the comprehensive plan done by the end of October for submission because in January the library commission will be awarding the grants for library construction.

1099
01:33:07,709 --> 01:33:10,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is a small amount to hold us over.

1100
01:33:11,326 --> 01:33:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: for a little bit of time to buy us into January to see if we're part of the process that will be given some funds to rehabilitate the whole library.

1101
01:33:23,975 --> 01:33:30,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I ask that this be done just to buy us a little bit of time to get us into January.

1102
01:33:30,139 --> 01:33:37,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I say, if in January we're successful with our grant, all the better.

1103
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But I say, you know, I'd hate to see the library go through another winter of leaking all over the place.

1104
01:33:44,317 --> 01:33:47,459
[SPEAKER_29]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Legelkern.

1105
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:49,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1106
01:33:50,461 --> 01:33:51,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm sorry.

1107
01:33:51,321 --> 01:33:52,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

1108
01:33:52,802 --> 01:33:54,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with Councilor Caraviello.

1109
01:33:54,323 --> 01:34:07,751
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this council made it very clear that the library leaking needed to be like top priority back, geez, February, February, March, I believe is when the leaking really began to happen.

1110
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:09,369
[SPEAKER_15]: and now we're in September.

1111
01:34:09,389 --> 01:34:16,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Councilor Knight had a great question and I also would continue on those questions with regards to if we expend this, what would happen?

1112
01:34:17,092 --> 01:34:26,676
[SPEAKER_15]: How much is it gonna be if we do want to change the structure of the building, put more money into it to create the second floor?

1113
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:31,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I think these are all questions that we almost need to know what the plan is going forward.

1114
01:34:31,519 --> 01:34:34,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know if that's the intention of the administration?

1115
01:34:35,212 --> 01:34:46,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think the initial report that came back on both the roof replacement and the feasibility of an addition is something that came in about a little over a week ago, and we're in the process of looking at it.

1116
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:54,247
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, the immediate recommendation is to do this estimated 35,000 to 45,000 repairs to make it weathertight.

1117
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:05,947
[SPEAKER_06]: tending to focus on that right away so that, as Councilor Caraviello said, we can assure that there won't be any roof leak issues going through the winter.

1118
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:12,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And how much would it cost to put a second floor and create those structural changes?

1119
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:17,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the report did not get into any projected cost analysis.

1120
01:35:17,672 --> 01:35:23,855
[SPEAKER_06]: The initial phase of the report was to do an existing condition study with focusing on a lot of the structural work.

1121
01:35:24,633 --> 01:35:26,474
[SPEAKER_06]: and that was all they were commissioned for.

1122
01:35:26,494 --> 01:35:40,357
[SPEAKER_06]: They did not get into any projected costs of any additions because at this time, there's not really any decisions been made in terms of size of the addition or what exactly the space would encompass for that addition.

1123
01:35:42,078 --> 01:35:50,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So is there any, I mean, I think the question was already answered by Councilor Knight, but we're expending this 35 to 45,000.

1124
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:53,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it gonna all be for naught if we decide to

1125
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,375
[SPEAKER_15]: create a second floor?

1126
01:35:56,375 --> 01:36:07,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand what you're saying, Councilor, but I wouldn't say it would be all for naught, because as you said, the roof is so bad, I think something really has to be done right now.

1127
01:36:08,037 --> 01:36:18,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we did decide to move forward with an addition in the near future, as we all know, going through the public procurement process, bid specs and design, that's going to take a little bit of time.

1128
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:23,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think that's time we can let the roof go the way it is without doing some type of repairs.

1129
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:26,508
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how my colleagues feel.

1130
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:37,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I've seen the roof in its leaky state for so many months, but at the same time, I do wish that we could sit down with the mayor and really see what the priorities are.

1131
01:36:37,538 --> 01:36:45,766
[SPEAKER_15]: And if the library happens to be the sixth or seventh priority versus the police station, then obviously, yes, let's put this money in immediately.

1132
01:36:45,886 --> 01:36:47,628
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, should we do more?

1133
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:48,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Should we do less?

1134
01:36:48,389 --> 01:36:50,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a number of questions that need to be asked.

1135
01:36:51,503 --> 01:36:55,245
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, face-to-face in a committee of the whole meeting so we can get a better idea.

1136
01:36:55,366 --> 01:37:01,970
[SPEAKER_15]: And I appreciate all the work Councilor Caraviello's doing and the grant that's going to be applied for, and hopefully we can make improvements to the library.

1137
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:08,394
[SPEAKER_15]: And this roof does badly need to be fixed, but should we be doing more at this stage or should we be doing a little less?

1138
01:37:08,534 --> 01:37:19,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think there's all kinds of questions that need to be asked within the scheme of where are we at with a number of different projects that this council and the administration want to move forward on.

1139
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:21,002
[SPEAKER_15]: And obviously, the administration is going

1140
01:37:21,504 --> 01:37:22,184
[SPEAKER_15]: take forefront.

1141
01:37:22,485 --> 01:37:39,916
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to, you know, obviously ruling authority is going to, you know, take place, but I just think we need to have some important—we need to be educated on it, and we need to know where we're going before we make money expenditures, whether it's $20,000 or a million and a half.

1142
01:37:40,076 --> 01:37:43,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I just feel like two lines is not enough.

1143
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:50,723
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just not enough, and I think whether it's 30 minutes or an hour, we need to be able to ask some questions and get to the bottom of the capital improvement plan.

1144
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:54,412
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1145
01:37:55,492 --> 01:37:55,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1146
01:37:55,913 --> 01:38:20,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to put my colleague Councilor Caraviello on the spot, but where he sits on the, um, uh, committee on the public library for the rehab of the public library, uh, in the best case scenario, if we were to get the grant money from the state after filing the application, are we looking at two years out before we possibly could get some funding and start

1147
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at an addition?

1148
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:23,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we looking at three years?

1149
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:24,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we?

1150
01:38:24,209 --> 01:38:26,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, um, you know, January is not that far away.

1151
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:44,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if we could, uh, I think if this, this, uh, holds us in the, into January, uh, I mean, like you said, you know, the funding is not going to come, you know, January 1st, you know, uh, applying for the funding space, you know, the first phase, um, we are, we're in the process of picking the architect right now and hopefully that'll be done by tomorrow.

1152
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:45,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's the goal.

1153
01:38:45,821 --> 01:38:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it done before the end of this week.

1154
01:38:47,862 --> 01:38:50,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so we can get that part,

1155
01:38:50,918 --> 01:38:56,101
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, the funding is not going to come immediately.

1156
01:38:56,481 --> 01:38:59,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And there'll be no putting a second floor on immediately.

1157
01:38:59,783 --> 01:39:02,264
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is something that is needed immediately.

1158
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:12,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're looking sometime, even if we were successful, you're looking at sometime well into next year, even on the good end.

1159
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, if we miss this round of funding, the next round doesn't come until 2022.

1160
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:23,384
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, you know, it's history.

1161
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this is a small amount of money to get us through this, to at least get us into January, and we'll know the direction of the library.

1162
01:39:34,492 --> 01:39:39,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say, I ask that we approve this tonight, so this can get started before the winter.

1163
01:39:40,177 --> 01:39:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, the contract is gonna be all, we're gonna end up being in the same predicament we got in with the sidewalks, we waited too long, and no one's gonna do the work.

1164
01:39:50,338 --> 01:40:01,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, Mr. Moki, it was about, uh, I don't know, maybe four months ago that, uh, there was an appropriation made, uh, for some repairs to the library roof.

1165
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:05,851
[SPEAKER_07]: They did some repointing, uh, around the top of the building.

1166
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:10,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, a major concern was the fact that no one was cleaning the drains.

1167
01:40:11,436 --> 01:40:18,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't have a lot of places where water was actually infiltrating through the roof, but people weren't cleaning the drains out in the top.

1168
01:40:19,009 --> 01:40:24,194
[SPEAKER_07]: that was creating pooling up there, and then water will find its way, you know, eventually.

1169
01:40:24,773 --> 01:40:28,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and that was a major repair from what I remember.

1170
01:40:28,716 --> 01:40:31,778
[SPEAKER_07]: The dollar amount was far less than $35,000 to $45,000.

1171
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:36,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the last four or five months, what have we found?

1172
01:40:37,303 --> 01:40:46,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we were told that they were going to fix the roof, not a complete roof because there were three options at the time, but fix the roof to stop the leaking.

1173
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought we did that.

1174
01:40:48,531 --> 01:40:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're saying that we're at $35,000 to $45,000 to

1175
01:40:54,088 --> 01:41:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: stop additional leaking now is this that's correct what we did this over this past winter as you just stated council was we were up there for a far less amount and we

1176
01:41:04,237 --> 01:41:07,760
[SPEAKER_06]: cleaned out some of the drains, and we patched whatever seams.

1177
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:14,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really a patching of a lot of seams that had been damaged over the years, some of the counter flashing, pulling away, things of that nature.

1178
01:41:15,066 --> 01:41:21,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But this study that was done by Russovar in August, it was a very comprehensive study of the roof condition itself.

1179
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:29,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things, to answer your question about what really changed, they found there's three layers of roofing up there, which

1180
01:41:30,898 --> 01:41:34,142
[SPEAKER_06]: is over 20 years old, so that has to all be stripped.

1181
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:48,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But also part of this, their recommendations to address exactly what you said, to flush, to use a jet stream of water, flush out all the drains, and put in new drain strainers at the top, the counter flashing,

1182
01:41:49,981 --> 01:41:58,209
[SPEAKER_06]: The counter flashing in several areas is really too low, and when you get to the flashing at the edges of the parapet walls up there, it's all pulling away.

1183
01:41:58,269 --> 01:42:06,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So this, more than just patch isolated areas that we saw before, they would also clean off the roof, power wash it, spray it down.

1184
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:17,546
[SPEAKER_06]: and walk the whole roof surface to just pinpoint and mark all the areas that are leaking and also put some type of hot welded seams there as opposed to just a cold pass.

1185
01:42:17,566 --> 01:42:31,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a much more elaborate repair than we did before, but it also goes into other areas of flashing and cleaning all the drains, because as you said, there's a lot of ponding up there and the drains just weren't working properly right now.

1186
01:42:32,885 --> 01:42:36,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you know, I, I agree with some of the comments in what council Longo said.

1187
01:42:36,407 --> 01:42:44,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I, and I think a meeting's definitely needed for this particular building because it's a much larger scope and the project's much larger.

1188
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:49,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but the library roof has been a bone of contention for a period of time now.

1189
01:42:49,934 --> 01:42:54,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's heavily used by our youngsters and residents of this community.

1190
01:42:54,796 --> 01:43:01,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think to at least give me a peace of mind and people working in the library and people that go, uh, frequent the library,

1191
01:43:02,684 --> 01:43:06,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a small amount to share up that particular roof.

1192
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:21,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would support this tonight, knowing that the study was done in August and that, you know, no matter what takes place with the building, we need to do something now, because I agree with you that we can't plan on a mild winter.

1193
01:43:21,933 --> 01:43:24,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, we have to plan for the worst.

1194
01:43:24,314 --> 01:43:27,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would support this tonight.

1195
01:43:29,416 --> 01:43:30,136
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor.

1196
01:43:30,756 --> 01:43:31,917
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Cavill, are you all set?

1197
01:43:33,037 --> 01:43:34,058
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1198
01:43:34,258 --> 01:43:36,060
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello.

1199
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,481
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1200
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I'll reserve my comments.

1201
01:43:40,163 --> 01:43:43,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're all understanding where we are right now and how we're going to vote.

1202
01:43:43,286 --> 01:43:46,549
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that point in time, I'd second Councilor Caraviello's move for approval.

1203
01:43:46,869 --> 01:43:49,511
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1204
01:43:49,551 --> 01:43:50,892
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco on that motion.

1205
01:43:51,913 --> 01:43:52,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1206
01:43:52,994 --> 01:43:56,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to also state, I think this is a project where time is of the essence.

1207
01:43:57,098 --> 01:43:58,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be done right away.

1208
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:01,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I think back to the winter where

1209
01:44:01,695 --> 01:44:04,177
[SPEAKER_03]: walking into the building, I felt like the ceiling was kind of like a sieve.

1210
01:44:04,317 --> 01:44:05,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the water was just coming in.

1211
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:08,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be repaired as soon as possible.

1212
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also would like to see this approved tonight.

1213
01:44:11,423 --> 01:44:12,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1214
01:44:12,423 --> 01:44:12,764
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1215
01:44:14,045 --> 01:44:15,866
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Locarno.

1216
01:44:15,886 --> 01:44:16,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1217
01:44:17,007 --> 01:44:24,453
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could ask just for an update in writing of exactly what the bid comes out at, the actual, whether that's $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, and what is actually going to be done.

1218
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:36,518
[SPEAKER_15]: and then just have an update at the completion of the project, so that we can better understand where the money was spent.

1219
01:44:37,899 --> 01:44:42,322
[SPEAKER_29]: As amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Mr. Kern, the motion for approval, I second it.

1220
01:44:42,803 --> 01:44:43,723

[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, sir.

1236
01:44:56,372 --> 01:44:57,893
[SPEAKER_29]: Seven in the positive, nine in the negative.

1237
01:44:57,913 --> 01:44:58,734

01:45:18,065 --> 01:45:18,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Your microphone.

1243
01:45:20,636 --> 01:45:23,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, for those at home that didn't hear.

1244
01:45:23,517 --> 01:45:31,061
[SPEAKER_07]: We had our first annual fundraiser for our dog park that's going to go on Riverbend, hopefully next year, behind the McGlynn School.

1245
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:34,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a fundraiser this Sunday, 11 to 3.

1246
01:45:35,443 --> 01:45:40,085
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a number of volunteers that came to the event.

1247
01:45:40,766 --> 01:45:41,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It was well attended.

1248
01:45:41,986 --> 01:45:45,708
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably washed anywhere from 70 to 85 dogs.

1249
01:45:46,408 --> 01:45:50,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me tell you, if you haven't washed a dog, it's a lot of work.

1250
01:45:50,643 --> 01:45:51,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of work.

1251
01:45:52,465 --> 01:45:59,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank the organizers, Mr. President, that have been with moving this dog park forward for the past two years.

1252
01:45:59,513 --> 01:46:07,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DeStefano, and Diane Gintner, the chicken and rice guys, sponsored the event.

1253
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:10,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So you came up, you got your dog wash, you got a plate of chicken and rice.

1254
01:46:10,839 --> 01:46:12,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a pet photographer there.

1255
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:23,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank the administration, the mayor's office for allowing us to use City Hall and allowing us for the event to go forward.

1256
01:46:24,402 --> 01:46:26,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I want to thank all the volunteers.

1257
01:46:27,662 --> 01:46:29,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very successful event.

1258
01:46:29,063 --> 01:46:35,664
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope to have more events and hopefully this will lead to first dog park in the community.

1259
01:46:35,704 --> 01:46:36,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1260
01:46:40,809 --> 01:46:42,390
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, Councilor Falco.

1261
01:46:44,051 --> 01:46:46,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I also would like to just to make a quick announcement.

1262
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that was that back in the spring, I offered a resolution to bring the monthly community police meetings, uh, into the neighborhoods.

1263
01:46:53,916 --> 01:47:01,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I've been working on that and, uh, happy to say that we have a few dates coming up where we're actually going to be bringing the community, uh, police meetings

1264
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:03,981
[SPEAKER_03]: into the various neighborhoods throughout our city.

1265
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore people can go to their, uh, just stay in the neighborhood and go to the meeting.

1266
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:09,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're bringing the meeting to them.

1267
01:47:10,423 --> 01:47:11,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yep.

1268
01:47:12,283 --> 01:47:12,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1269
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:16,345
[SPEAKER_03]: The first meeting is going to be October 5th at the Brooke school.

1270
01:47:17,485 --> 01:47:21,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the second meeting will be November 2nd at St.

[SPEAKER_03]: The third meeting will be on December 7th at the Andrews school.

1273
01:47:27,153 --> 01:47:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: and the fourth meeting will be in South Medford, I believe on January 4th, but I just have to confirm that, but I just wanted to let everybody know that those community meetings have been set up.

1274
01:47:37,239 --> 01:47:41,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked with the chief about that as well, so we're always looking forward to it.

1275
01:47:41,582 --> 01:47:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: They all start at 7 p.m., and if anyone has any questions, feel free to give me a call, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.

1276

1282
01:48:17,112 --> 01:48:23,236
[SPEAKER_29]: the contract to the lowest qualified bidder for the City Hall roof, parapet, and dome.

1283
01:48:23,757 --> 01:48:34,144
[SPEAKER_29]: An additional project, phase two, will be bid in the spring for internal work in the council chambers and external work such as front entrance, doors, et cetera.

1284
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:38,527
[SPEAKER_29]: As you are aware, this body authorized the study to be performed

1285
01:48:39,049 --> 01:48:41,111
[SPEAKER_29]: by Rousseau Bar in late spring.

1286
01:48:41,652 --> 01:48:48,440
[SPEAKER_29]: They prepared the specifications for this bid, and we are eager to get this project started before the winter settles in.

1287
01:48:49,181 --> 01:48:55,709
[SPEAKER_29]: As you will note, there is a loan order on the agenda to cover the project, as well as the estimate for phase two work.

1288
01:48:56,501 --> 01:48:59,402
[SPEAKER_29]: We hope that you will authorize both appropriations.

1289
01:48:59,902 --> 01:49:05,324
[SPEAKER_29]: And once the loan order takes three readings, we will submit a paper to rescind this vote.

1290
01:49:05,744 --> 01:49:11,106
[SPEAKER_29]: The balance and certified free cash prior to this vote is 8,187,775.

1291
01:49:12,406 --> 01:49:18,108
[SPEAKER_29]: The building commissioner, Paul Moki will be present to answer any questions you may have.

1292
01:49:18,508 --> 01:49:21,009
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Mr. Moki to explain this paper.

1293
01:49:34,019 --> 01:49:35,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1294
01:49:35,059 --> 01:49:54,992

01:51:02,327 --> 01:51:03,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank you.

1323
01:51:05,549 --> 01:51:06,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Rule 20 has been invoked.

1324
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:09,772
[SPEAKER_29]: Section four, which ends.

1325
01:51:09,792 --> 01:51:22,059
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1326
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:23,159
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight consults.

1327
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:23,880
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the rules.

1328
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:24,900
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the rule.

1329
01:51:25,441 --> 01:51:25,901
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the rule.

1330
01:51:30,087 --> 01:51:55,822
[SPEAKER_29]: On motion of council night to return to the regular order business all those in favor all those opposed motion carries 16-6 55 offered by council caraviello be resolved that Medford City Council requests the metric police increase the president presence in Medford Square and discuss possibility of putting on a foot or bicycle patrol officer council caviello Thank You mr. President mr. President I've been to

1331
01:51:56,827 --> 01:52:03,874
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple meetings about the improvements in Medford Square and making Medford Square more viable.

1332
01:52:04,795 --> 01:52:13,324
[SPEAKER_05]: During my mornings in the Square, in the afternoons in the Square, and late in the evening in the Square, there's a lot of loitering in the Square, people sitting around,

1333
01:52:14,788 --> 01:52:24,653
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Century Bank Garden there, smoking, using vulgar language, sleeping on the benches, same thing over where the bus area is.

1334
01:52:25,633 --> 01:52:36,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, people, as I say, people using vulgar language, again, sleeping on the benches there, and just littering the place.

1335
01:52:36,919 --> 01:52:39,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sunday, we're gonna open up the Peace Garden.

1336
01:52:40,528 --> 01:52:51,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope that that won't happen over there, because I've already heard concerns from many seniors that they're afraid that that's going to happen.

1337
01:52:51,951 --> 01:53:06,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the effort of trying to draw people to the square, having people sleeping on benches and doing those things is not the appeal that we're looking for, and that's not a way to get business or people into the square.

1338
01:53:06,955 --> 01:53:08,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I would ask that the chief

1339
01:53:10,028 --> 01:53:12,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was here, but he's left.

1340
01:53:15,194 --> 01:53:26,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Offer some kind of help with either a foot patrol officer during the day to get these vagrants out of there, to stop people from sleeping on the benches.

1341
01:53:27,727 --> 01:53:30,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's an ordinance about sleeping on the street.

1342
01:53:30,993 --> 01:53:37,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, police officers drive by these guys multiple times, and somebody's got to get them off there.

1343
01:53:37,177 --> 01:53:39,159
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look good for the merchants.

1344
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:47,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard from many merchants in the morning that they're coming from the rooming houses that we have in the Method Square area.

1345
01:53:47,764 --> 01:53:50,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, someone's got to keep these people moving on.

1346
01:53:52,134 --> 01:53:55,037
[SPEAKER_05]: to entice businesses to get there and not chase business away.

1347
01:53:55,578 --> 01:53:58,741
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1348
01:53:59,061 --> 01:53:59,782
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

1349
01:54:00,142 --> 01:54:00,723
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1350
01:54:01,223 --> 01:54:03,706
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1351
01:54:03,726 --> 01:54:05,387
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-656 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1352
01:54:05,808 --> 01:54:12,815
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council recommend to the police chief that no trucks be allowed on Harvard Avenue

1353
01:54:13,472 --> 01:54:20,217
[SPEAKER_29]: in efforts to increase public safety, be it further resolved that the crosswalk at Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road be repainted.

1354
01:54:20,277 --> 01:54:20,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Kavial.

1355
01:54:21,258 --> 01:54:22,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1356
01:54:22,378 --> 01:54:35,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, you know, a few weeks ago when they had the basketball tournament down at Duggar Park, when I was down there, I saw tanker trucks coming down Harvard Avenue.

1357
01:54:36,733 --> 01:54:42,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they're doing is, you know, they're trying to avoid High Street now with the traffic being the way it is.

1358
01:54:43,434 --> 01:54:50,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, Harvard Avenue is no way equipped to handle 18-wheel trucks on that road.

1359
01:54:51,576 --> 01:54:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a park there.

1360
01:54:53,496 --> 01:55:05,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's bad enough that road is narrow when there's cars parking on it, but to have oil tankers going down there on a regular basis, Mr. President, it's just not a thing to do.

1361
01:55:05,926 --> 01:55:12,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that the chief put up a no heavy trucking sign and maybe do a little bit of patrol there for the trucks.

1362
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:20,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Mr. President, the crosswalks on Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road have not been painted yet.

1363
01:55:20,614 --> 01:55:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a playground there, kids are crossing the street.

1364
01:55:23,415 --> 01:55:28,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And the unfortunate part is the DCR just paved that street.

1365
01:55:29,598 --> 01:55:34,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you pave the street, what happens is the Mystic River Road was paved by the DCR.

1366
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:42,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, they did an outstanding job, but when you pave the street, the cars go down there more and they go faster.

1367
01:55:43,577 --> 01:55:49,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, people just aren't stopping at those stop signs there on Harvard Ave or on Mystic River Street.

1368
01:55:49,802 --> 01:56:02,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the chief could put up a sign there and maybe put up a little bit more patrol over there to slow the cars down, and if the mayor could have the DPW paint the sidewalks, it'll be appreciated.

1369
01:56:02,995 --> 01:56:06,216
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion approved by Councilor Caraviello, Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1370
01:56:06,736 --> 01:56:09,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I was going to say a motion to refer the matter to the Traffic Commission for review.

1371
01:56:10,016 --> 01:56:11,536
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in support of it wholeheartedly.

1372
01:56:11,556 --> 01:56:14,217
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a great resolution and I thank Councilor Caraviello for putting it on.

1373
01:56:14,837 --> 01:56:17,237
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval, as amended, all those in favor?

1374
01:56:17,858 --> 01:56:18,578
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1375
01:56:18,998 --> 01:56:21,118
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1376
01:56:21,138 --> 01:56:22,758
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-657 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1377
01:56:22,778 --> 01:56:31,740
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the Building Department instruct the owners of the WEEI property on Commercial Street to install a

1378
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:39,463
[SPEAKER_29]: a six-foot fence from the adjoining property to the guardrail in an effort to stop the illegal dumping.

1379
01:56:39,884 --> 01:56:49,870
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it further resolved that the city install a no-dumping sign and look into the purchase of a poll camera to help apprehend the parties doing the illegal dumping.

1380
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:50,430
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor.

1381
01:56:50,890 --> 01:56:51,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:58,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I went by there about two weeks ago, and that area of Commercial Street

1383
01:56:59,278 --> 01:57:06,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I think had 16 television sets there that the DPW cleaned up along with all the building refuse.

1384
01:57:07,283 --> 01:57:12,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made a call to DPW, they came down, they were great, they picked it up.

1385
01:57:12,606 --> 01:57:15,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I went by the next day, there was rubbish there again.

1386
01:57:16,889 --> 01:57:21,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down and I spoke to John Bavuso about who owned the property.

1387
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:23,332
[SPEAKER_05]: He informed me that it's owned by WEI.

1388
01:57:24,743 --> 01:57:38,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked about if it would be possible for them to put a fence of six foot height from the adjoining property at least to the guardrail to curtail the dumping.

1389
01:57:38,787 --> 01:57:40,308
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that he didn't see a problem with that.

1390
01:57:42,128 --> 01:57:50,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than that, if the dump is gonna continue there and there's no fence there, let the owners of the property start picking up the tab for cleaning the property up.

1391
01:57:50,911 --> 01:57:56,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fair to those people down there, that when they go home, to see all that rubbish dumped on the side there.

1392
01:57:56,695 --> 01:58:01,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I know we had talked about putting a poll camera up there at some point.

1393
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where that went, I don't know if I think we approved it, but obviously it's not there, and there's no sign that says no dumping.

1394
01:58:11,806 --> 01:58:13,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we get a make-believe sign that says there's a camera there.

1395
01:58:15,709 --> 01:58:16,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Long overdue.

1396
01:58:17,871 --> 01:58:26,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe that were, but you know, these are small fixes, you know, to pick up the crib appeal of our city.

1397
01:58:27,055 --> 01:58:32,557
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't want to be riding down a business area and see, you know, 16 television sets dumped on the side of the road.

1398
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's not fair that DBW has to keep going down there and picking them up.

1399
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:43,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Either put up a fence or let the owner of the property start paying for the cleanup of the property himself.

1400
01:58:44,524 --> 01:58:49,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can send a letter to the owners, asking them, requesting that they put up a fence.

1401
01:58:50,647 --> 01:58:52,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I say, I did speak to Mr. Vavuso.

1402
01:58:53,208 --> 01:58:59,671
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought it was a good idea also, and he will await a motion for us about sending a letter to the owner of the property.

1403
01:59:00,112 --> 01:59:02,113
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello.

1404
01:59:02,133 --> 01:59:02,913
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

1405
01:59:03,433 --> 01:59:04,133
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1406
01:59:04,214 --> 01:59:05,994
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion passes.

1407
01:59:06,014 --> 01:59:12,437
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-658, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the temporary bus stop closure at Main and High Street be discussed.

1408
01:59:12,578 --> 01:59:13,158
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

1409
01:59:14,513 --> 01:59:15,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1410
01:59:15,814 --> 01:59:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the, uh, bus stop at the corner of, uh, main and high street was temporarily closed due to the, uh, construction of the credit bridge from August 31st to September 14th.

1411
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:35,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, I was contacted by a property owner in that direct area.

1412
01:59:36,687 --> 01:59:39,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said if they can close it for two weeks to help,

1413
01:59:39,577 --> 01:59:44,221
[SPEAKER_07]: with construction, why can't we leave it closed until the construction's over?

1414
01:59:45,022 --> 01:59:58,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And it made sense to me, Mr. President, that anything we can do to help the business area would be beneficial to not only the businesses, but also to the residents that traverse that area.

1415
01:59:58,875 --> 02:00:05,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would ask that the temporary closing, which took place August 31st to September 14th,

1416
02:00:06,789 --> 02:00:16,995
[SPEAKER_07]: remain in effect until the Craddock Bridge is fully operational, Mr. President, and then we can revert back to a stop being there.

1417
02:00:17,515 --> 02:00:31,102
[SPEAKER_07]: We received a report from MassDOT through Councilor Scarpelli's due diligence of several bus stops that we requested to be moved, and that does have a high ridership.

1418
02:00:31,602 --> 02:00:38,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I can appreciate that they're saying it services approximately 600 passengers a day on a number of bus routes.

1419
02:00:39,629 --> 02:00:55,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I know that's a heavy traveled area, but I would say that in due deference to the businesses in that particular location, that this be taken under advisement, Mr. President.

1420
02:00:58,384 --> 02:00:59,985
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

1421
02:01:00,615 --> 02:01:01,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you.

1422
02:01:01,616 --> 02:01:02,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1423
02:01:02,357 --> 02:01:06,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank my fellow council, Mr. Marks for bringing this to, uh, to the table tonight.

1424
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:16,448
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that I would have added to the agenda after talking to the dot, um, coordinator this afternoon or early this evening before we came on board here.

1425
02:01:17,129 --> 02:01:26,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, one thing they've told us is that this, it was still, still closed even past the September 14th date and their hope was it will be reopened this evening.

1426
02:01:28,015 --> 02:01:41,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I did, like I said in the past, I did talk to a few members of the Disability Commission and they're having a meeting on Wednesday evening.

1427
02:01:42,103 --> 02:01:47,906
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the biggest concerns I still have with this stop that wasn't addressed is the safety of

1428
02:01:48,833 --> 02:01:49,953
[SPEAKER_10]: the buses pulling up.

1429
02:01:50,334 --> 02:02:01,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that they've tried to in the past move the buses forward, but they're still sticking out and they're still staying in the lane and people are still crossing off the sidewalk onto the bus.

1430
02:02:01,237 --> 02:02:05,619
[SPEAKER_10]: So I still feel that because of the construction, it's very dangerous.

1431
02:02:05,839 --> 02:02:15,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but I did, um, I did promise, um, the, uh, disability commission that we would meet before we made anything final.

1432
02:02:15,562 --> 02:02:17,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I, I, I would,

1433
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:23,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I would concur with my fellow council that we ask to keep this, um, that stop closed.

1434
02:02:24,135 --> 02:02:28,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd call for a subcommittee meeting next Tuesday if we could.

1435
02:02:29,299 --> 02:02:34,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the, uh, um, I'm sorry.

1436
02:02:36,164 --> 02:02:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: We can, but if we can have a meeting that we can hold a meeting with the, uh, disability commission and at least until this side of the project, but this isn't, isn't, believe it or not, isn't very a long time.

1437
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:46,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

1438
02:02:48,605 --> 02:03:07,587
[SPEAKER_10]: further to go on that side is, um, I think if we can do that, that'd be greatly appreciated on my end that if we can ask to keep that closed for now until next week and then have a meeting with the disability commission in, uh, explaining in depth what this is with the, uh, department of transportation.

1439
02:03:08,053 --> 02:03:17,196
[SPEAKER_29]: So the motion is to keep that bus stop closed until consultation with the DOT and disability commission is completed.

1440
02:03:17,596 --> 02:03:19,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It's currently working now.

1441
02:03:19,357 --> 02:03:21,037
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying it will be reopened this evening.

1442
02:03:21,377 --> 02:03:24,758
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they told me tonight, this evening, this evening.

1443
02:03:24,798 --> 02:03:27,919
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying that everything will go back as, as it was in the past.

1444
02:03:27,979 --> 02:03:32,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but there was also supposed to be done September 14th and that hasn't stopped.

1445
02:03:32,341 --> 02:03:36,742
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and again, that leads to one of the questions we had that was, uh,

1446
02:03:38,037 --> 02:03:55,740
[SPEAKER_10]: a big fear of mine was the safety of that stop during the construction, because I know in pretty demanding and loud voices, the DOT and the T has told us that it's not

1447
02:03:56,235 --> 02:04:02,478
[SPEAKER_10]: the project's fault that the buses aren't pulling all the way up and getting close to the sidewalk, that there's plenty of space.

1448
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:03,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done that.

1449
02:04:03,878 --> 02:04:07,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I traverse that route every single day just for that purpose.

1450
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:17,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And because of the extra barrels and the opening of that gate, there is absolutely no way the bus can go to that full length of what's needed under their law.

1451
02:04:17,464 --> 02:04:21,686
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, that opens up, I think, a big safety issue.

1452
02:04:21,726 --> 02:04:23,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to, um,

1453
02:04:24,035 --> 02:04:45,102
[SPEAKER_10]: concur with my fellow colleague, and I hope the rest of our committee would agree, and then have a meeting as soon as possible with the Department of Transportation and the Disability Commission to look into this process of closing it until the end of that construction period on that side.

1454
02:04:45,122 --> 02:04:50,904
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like a motion for approval, Mr. President.

1455
02:04:55,785 --> 02:04:56,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1456
02:04:56,466 --> 02:05:05,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if we vote for approval tonight, if we could have the clerks send a letter to the TDC first thing in the morning, letting them know of our decision.

1457
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,643
[SPEAKER_29]: As amended by Councilor Caraviello.

1458
02:05:09,264 --> 02:05:10,005
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor.

1459
02:05:10,892 --> 02:05:11,572
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1460
02:05:11,873 --> 02:05:14,374
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1461
02:05:14,394 --> 02:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-659 offered by Councilor Falco.

1462
02:05:16,515 --> 02:05:37,825
[SPEAKER_29]: Whereas the guardrail on Russell Street and Crane Street is in disrepair, whereas the guardrail is overgrown with weeds and brush and impedes walking on the sidewalk, be it resolved that in the interest of public safety, the guardrail be replaced and the weeds and brush be removed as soon as possible.

1463
02:05:38,246 --> 02:05:38,986
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco.

1464
02:05:39,554 --> 02:05:40,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1465
02:05:40,375 --> 02:05:41,295
[SPEAKER_29]: A well-written motion.

1466
02:05:41,515 --> 02:05:42,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1467
02:05:43,497 --> 02:05:44,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1468
02:05:45,058 --> 02:05:53,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I received a number of calls from the residents on Russell Street regarding the guardrail that it's basically on Russell Street.

1469
02:05:53,384 --> 02:05:55,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And it stands between Russell Street and Crane Street.

1470
02:05:56,446 --> 02:05:59,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been in disrepair for quite some time now.

1471
02:05:59,949 --> 02:06:03,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also overgrown with lots of brush, and weeds, and trees, and whatnot.

1472
02:06:04,532 --> 02:06:07,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely a public safety concern.

1473
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a picture of it here if anybody wants to see it.

1474
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:19,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really tough to, if anybody had any type of disability wanted to get by in a wheelchair, it'd be really tough to navigate.

1475
02:06:19,885 --> 02:06:20,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really overgrown.

1476
02:06:21,346 --> 02:06:23,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The guide rail is in complete disrepair.

1477
02:06:23,827 --> 02:06:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be replaced.

1478
02:06:25,268 --> 02:06:27,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to see it replaced as soon as possible.

1479
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:37,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And if possible, at least if we could start by getting the DPW to trim the weeds and trim it back a bit just so people can,

1480
02:06:38,023 --> 02:06:39,144
[SPEAKER_03]: traverse that sidewalk.

1481
02:06:39,624 --> 02:06:51,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to make a motion to have this approved and actually if we could have the guide rail replaced and if we could have the DPW in the meantime before its replacement, if we could have them clean up the area, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1482
02:06:52,049 --> 02:06:53,490
[SPEAKER_29]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1483
02:06:53,710 --> 02:06:53,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1484
02:06:54,190 --> 02:06:54,871
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1485
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:55,611
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1486
02:06:55,631 --> 02:06:56,351
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-660, whereas

1487
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:16,174
[SPEAKER_29]: offered by Councilor Falco, whereas all neighborhoods throughout our city are negatively impacted by graffiti and tagging, be it resolved that the city ordinance section 62 to 94 be updated to impose a fine to property owners for non-removal of graffiti or tagging.

1488
02:07:16,654 --> 02:07:17,395
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco.

1489
02:07:18,536 --> 02:07:19,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1490
02:07:20,217 --> 02:07:22,919
[SPEAKER_03]: This here is an issue that

1491
02:07:23,487 --> 02:07:28,290
[SPEAKER_03]: impacts or has a negative effect on all of our communities, all of our neighborhoods throughout the city.

1492
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: As you drive around, you see graffiti, tagging on a lot of commercial property, it seems like.

1493
02:07:36,314 --> 02:07:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I did some research, I found that there's penalties and fines for the person that actually tags the property, but there's no, we have nothing in the ordinance to actually

1494
02:07:51,604 --> 02:07:53,745
[SPEAKER_03]: have the graffiti removed by the property owner.

1495
02:07:54,365 --> 02:08:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's unfortunate, but I mean, Councilor Caraviello had a great resolution earlier in the year where, you know, the Bigelow building on Forest Street, and that's a gateway to our square.

1496
02:08:05,989 --> 02:08:11,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You come down Forest Street, you know, if you go to a show at the Chevalier or you're heading to Method Square, what do you see?

1497
02:08:11,371 --> 02:08:14,732
[SPEAKER_03]: The building on the left and graffiti all over the side of the building.

1498
02:08:15,301 --> 02:08:20,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been there for months and there's no teeth in the ordinance to actually have it cleaned.

1499
02:08:20,986 --> 02:08:26,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can send out the code enforcement officer, but he really can't do anything about it because there's no teeth.

1500
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:27,571
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fine.

1501
02:08:27,591 --> 02:08:28,071
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing.

1502
02:08:28,852 --> 02:08:32,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I really feel that, you know, something needs to be done about this.

1503
02:08:32,855 --> 02:08:39,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, maybe this paper goes into subcommittee where we research it and see what they do in other cities and towns, but something needs to be done.

1504
02:08:39,841 --> 02:08:43,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, all over the city, I see graffiti and tagging and there's really,

1505
02:08:44,886 --> 02:08:46,106
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing being done about it.

1506
02:08:46,466 --> 02:08:48,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think something needs to be done.

1507
02:08:48,407 --> 02:08:53,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It sends a message to people when they come to our community and they see this, they say, what's going on here?

1508
02:08:53,148 --> 02:08:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's graffiti everywhere.

1509
02:08:54,808 --> 02:08:56,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it really sends a message.

1510
02:08:57,008 --> 02:09:00,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing with graffiti and tagging, if you don't take it down right away, it gets worse.

1511
02:09:01,569 --> 02:09:05,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And people add to it and it just multiplies and it gets out of control.

1512
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:10,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we're at a point now where, you know, you go to each corner of the city, there are buildings that have it.

1513
02:09:11,015 --> 02:09:12,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And something needs to be done about it.

1514
02:09:12,536 --> 02:09:17,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to offer this resolution, and I'd hope that everyone would support it.

1515
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:30,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that going to subcommittee is probably the proper approach to take, because I think we should research it with other cities and towns to see what other cities and towns do, just to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1516
02:09:31,086 --> 02:09:34,167
[SPEAKER_03]: but I would like the council's support on this, so thank you.

1517
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:34,607
[SPEAKER_29]: Very good.

1518
02:09:34,647 --> 02:09:38,488
[SPEAKER_29]: Zoning and ordinance would be the committee on that motion.

1519
02:09:38,548 --> 02:09:39,388
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Caraviello.

1520
02:09:39,508 --> 02:09:40,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1521
02:09:40,528 --> 02:09:43,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, again, thank Councilor Falco.

1522
02:09:43,309 --> 02:09:47,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I brought up the big old building and the building right beside it multiple times.

1523
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:49,290
[SPEAKER_05]: The graffiti is still there.

1524
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:56,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, you know, we have meetings, but we want to build up the square, build a community.

1525
02:09:56,191 --> 02:09:58,772
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes to the curb appeal of the city.

1526
02:09:59,223 --> 02:10:00,384
[SPEAKER_05]: or curb appeal is horrible.

1527
02:10:00,984 --> 02:10:19,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, you know, um, I, I don't know how to, uh, you know, put teeth into it, but you know, in the past, you know, the sheriff's department has come down and, uh, with the graffiti patrol and, uh, and, uh, and taking the graffiti down the past, maybe we can make it an appeal to a sheriff contusion, maybe come down again.

1528
02:10:19,099 --> 02:10:20,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they do private buildings.

1529
02:10:21,942 --> 02:10:24,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but again, uh, it's a, uh,

1530
02:10:25,245 --> 02:10:35,687
[SPEAKER_05]: The curb appeal in our city is horrible, and as long as people go around tagging, and they're tagging all parts of the city, it just negatively impacts everybody.

1531
02:10:36,307 --> 02:10:42,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I support this motion, and I've had similar motions in the past, but I'd say the pain is still there.

1532
02:10:46,189 --> 02:10:47,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1533
02:10:47,569 --> 02:10:54,010
[SPEAKER_22]: I certainly can appreciate the ordinance, and I think that back last session, Councilor Marks came up with actually

1534
02:10:55,049 --> 02:11:13,639
[SPEAKER_22]: an excellent idea on a way to combat graffiti in private residences by creating a revolving graffiti removal account and having a graffiti removal team that will go out and speak with property owners who have been affected by graffiti and then, with their permission and waiver liability, be allowed to go onto the private property and remove that graffiti.

1535
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:20,984
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that this is a great opportunity for us to explore further what options and opportunities we have to address this problem.

1536
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:23,265
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that, you know, one of the things

1537
02:11:24,016 --> 02:11:26,798
[SPEAKER_22]: that Councilor Marks put together was an actual team that will go out and do it.

1538
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:41,028
[SPEAKER_22]: And when we look at our DPW and some of the areas that we can improve on, I think that we might want to look at creating a permanent sign department that's responsible for the erecting of signs and the removal of graffiti in public and private places.

1539
02:11:41,088 --> 02:11:46,372
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that this would be a great, great place to start for us to have the discussion and to jump off on speaking on it.

1540
02:11:46,592 --> 02:11:51,476
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, Councilor Falco sits on the zoning and ordinance subcommittee with myself and Councilor Caraviello.

1541
02:11:51,536 --> 02:11:52,697
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know, I think that,

1542
02:11:53,875 --> 02:11:57,556
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a work product that shows that we've been able to get things done when we met and worked together.

1543
02:11:57,616 --> 02:12:00,557
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, with that being said, I wholeheartedly support the ordinance.

1544
02:12:00,597 --> 02:12:04,218
[SPEAKER_22]: I look forward to sitting down with my colleagues on the zoning subcommittee and addressing the issue.

1545
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:04,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

1546
02:12:07,999 --> 02:12:08,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1547
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:10,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, uh, console nights.

1548
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1549
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:20,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was about seven or eight months ago when console Caraviello offered his resolution about, uh, finding owners that leave graffiti up.

1550
02:12:20,863 --> 02:12:23,484
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, I, I don't have a problem if,

1551
02:12:23,991 --> 02:12:34,617
[SPEAKER_07]: The city approaches a business, and in this case, it could be a homeowner too, because we're saying business could be a homeowner, and after many attempts, the homeowner of the business says, you know what?

1552
02:12:35,077 --> 02:12:36,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to clean that off.

1553
02:12:36,618 --> 02:12:40,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I think there should be teeth that you can go after the business or the homeowner.

1554
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:46,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The concern I have is I, as a homeowner, someone comes up Halloween night and spray paints the front of my house.

1555
02:12:48,257 --> 02:12:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the ordinance reads, within 10 days, 14 days, I have to remove it.

1556
02:12:52,203 --> 02:12:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: That adds insult to injury.

1557
02:12:54,005 --> 02:12:57,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just got my house spray painted.

1558
02:12:57,330 --> 02:13:00,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably going to cost me hundreds of dollars, if not $1,000 or $2,000 to remove it.

1559
02:13:03,419 --> 02:13:07,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I have the city saying, if you don't remove it within X number of days, we're going to fine you.

1560
02:13:08,405 --> 02:13:11,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, you know, it's a little too much.

1561
02:13:11,928 --> 02:13:13,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see people that are leaving it up.

1562
02:13:13,810 --> 02:13:22,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the business that we refer to on Forest Street, that was cleaned off a number of times, and the tagging went back a number of times.

1563
02:13:23,164 --> 02:13:29,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't, you know, there may be some new stuff or some older stuff still up there, but I think we have to be very careful.

1564
02:13:30,187 --> 02:13:33,108
[SPEAKER_07]: The City of Somerville has a great program.

1565
02:13:33,588 --> 02:13:38,010
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, on their website, they have a place where you can report graffiti.

1566
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:42,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, they have, what Councilor Knight was saying, they have an agreement.

1567
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Removal of Graffiti Agreement and Release of Liability.

1568
02:13:47,225 --> 02:14:06,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They will go to anyone's home, they will go to any business, if the business owner signs the liability form, and Councilor Scarpelli can probably speak better than this than I can, and the liability form waives any type of liability that the city of Somerville may have in the process of cleaning this up.

1569
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:10,630
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a great alternative to offer to people that were just wronged.

1570
02:14:11,031 --> 02:14:16,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, most people, you know, don't ask to get their house graffitied or their garage graffitied or whatever it might be.

1571
02:14:17,432 --> 02:14:19,233
[SPEAKER_07]: this is something that's done by vandals.

1572
02:14:19,953 --> 02:14:24,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think to offer a service is a great suggestion.

1573
02:14:25,215 --> 02:14:29,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you offer a service and someone doesn't want to take you up on it, then maybe we should have teeth.

1574
02:14:30,376 --> 02:14:32,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have a clean it or lean it ordinance.

1575
02:14:32,777 --> 02:14:36,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And the clean it or lean it ordinance, in my opinion, would apply to graffiti also.

1576
02:14:37,099 --> 02:14:38,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And that calls for a penalty.

1577
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:44,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe we can enforce the clean it or lean it on graffiti if need be.

1578
02:14:44,563 --> 02:14:49,345
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this city is very lax when it comes to any type of enforcement.

1579
02:14:50,266 --> 02:14:52,226
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like what Somerville does.

1580
02:14:52,527 --> 02:14:53,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a great idea.

1581
02:14:53,827 --> 02:14:57,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to penalize business owners or

1582
02:14:57,789 --> 02:15:05,811
[SPEAKER_07]: residents that may have been tagged and saying, well, you better get that off or we're not going to only tag you, we're going to send you a bill on top of it.

1583
02:15:06,531 --> 02:15:07,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a problem with that.

1584
02:15:07,892 --> 02:15:15,134
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we can craft something that makes sense and possibly look at, like Councilor Knight mentioned, about having

1585
02:15:16,012 --> 02:15:22,093
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a dedicated office that will go out and do some graffiti removal in this community.

1586
02:15:23,093 --> 02:15:29,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I had someone drop off today to my house because they saw this on the agenda, a bottle.

1587
02:15:30,455 --> 02:15:41,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm glad they didn't put it in a briefcase or some other bag because it dropped off a bottle of, it's called clarinet.

1588
02:15:42,865 --> 02:15:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a substance that a lot of municipalities use.

1589
02:15:46,848 --> 02:15:48,330
[SPEAKER_07]: You spray it on any new cement.

1590
02:15:48,730 --> 02:15:59,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we did the Fast 14 project, you spray it on the cement that's holding up the bridges, and it makes it 100 times easier to remove graffiti.

1591
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:04,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, it's a cost-effective way of, at least the city doing it.

1592
02:16:05,004 --> 02:16:11,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't recommend people spraying their homes with this, but I think it's an effective way for municipalities

1593
02:16:11,732 --> 02:16:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: and in locations that are prone to, to, uh, graffiti, uh, to use this substance, uh, Mr. President.

1594
02:16:18,858 --> 02:16:24,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, there's a lengthy, um, uh, material safety data sheet that came with it.

1595
02:16:25,403 --> 02:16:30,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the city administration is interested, I'd be more than happy to pass this on.

1596
02:16:31,248 --> 02:16:38,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I won't leave it at city hall because I don't want them thinking I'm leaving something around that, uh, could be construed as something else.

1597
02:16:38,934 --> 02:16:39,395
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um,

1598
02:16:40,975 --> 02:16:44,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with this resolution, and I thank my council colleague for offering it.

1599
02:16:45,996 --> 02:16:46,717
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Campbell.

1600
02:16:46,817 --> 02:16:47,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1601
02:16:47,657 --> 02:16:54,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think it was Councilor Marks who offered the resolution for the city to go out and buy some equipment to do this.

1602
02:16:54,519 --> 02:16:59,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's only a pressure washer, a high-end pressure washer.

1603
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:07,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, not very expensive, and it's kind of a simple fix that could be done.

1604
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:11,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of people have them in their homes.

1605
02:17:11,911 --> 02:17:15,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But I say, I don't know why, I'm sure our city has one.

1606
02:17:16,014 --> 02:17:17,255
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't have one, we should have one.

1607
02:17:17,936 --> 02:17:25,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, and if we did have one, but the people would sign the agreement.

1608
02:17:25,742 --> 02:17:27,523
[SPEAKER_05]: The DPW could help these people out also.

1609
02:17:27,883 --> 02:17:31,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I support Councilor Falco's motion there.

1610
02:17:33,728 --> 02:17:34,388
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco.

1611
02:17:34,609 --> 02:17:35,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1612
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:43,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my council colleagues for their suggestions because I think, you know, this at least starts the discussion as to what we can do.

1613
02:17:44,029 --> 02:17:51,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some great suggestions came from Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks, Councilor Caraviello with regard to actually maybe bringing on a team or having a department that does that.

1614
02:17:52,355 --> 02:17:56,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe incorporated with some teeth if someone refuses, you know, that's something we can look at.

1615
02:17:56,898 --> 02:17:59,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But the discussion begins and I think that's the important piece.

1616
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to thank my colleagues for their support.

1617
02:18:02,802 --> 02:18:03,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1618
02:18:03,122 --> 02:18:03,463
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1619
02:18:03,483 --> 02:18:06,505
[SPEAKER_29]: So on the motion for approval, citizen wishes to speak.

1620
02:18:08,999 --> 02:18:10,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1621
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:20,143
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 281 Park Street, and I saw this item on the agenda, and in the past couple of months, I've posted a couple of graffiti incidents that happened at the Roberts School.

1622
02:18:22,124 --> 02:18:27,026
[SPEAKER_23]: So I posted for two months, someone had written on the side of the school, and the complaint wasn't acknowledged.

1623
02:18:27,546 --> 02:18:37,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Finally, this past week, a private citizen messaged me and told me that they had gone down to the school with a bucket and water and a scrub brush and cleaned the graffiti off the school.

1624
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,663
[SPEAKER_23]: which thank you very much for cleaning the school.

1625
02:18:42,264 --> 02:18:44,747
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think he should have had to but I appreciate that he did that.

1626
02:18:45,148 --> 02:18:52,198
[SPEAKER_23]: There's also a pedestrian crossing sign at the school that has had graffiti on it and the bottom rivet is not connected and that's been there for about two years.

1627
02:18:52,696 --> 02:18:55,199
[SPEAKER_23]: I know several parents have called and complained about that.

1628
02:18:55,759 --> 02:19:01,285
[SPEAKER_23]: So our DPW, I know, is short-staffed and they really are not able to handle this overflow.

1629
02:19:01,345 --> 02:19:04,408
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think the graffiti issue in the city is probably more of a symptom.

1630
02:19:05,569 --> 02:19:08,132
[SPEAKER_23]: I can also cite an example of businesses on Spring Street.

1631
02:19:08,653 --> 02:19:14,559
[SPEAKER_23]: I drove down Spring Street and there was someone had written their name about 40 or 50 times on one building on Spring Street.

1632
02:19:15,988 --> 02:19:23,732
[SPEAKER_23]: And I drove down less than a week later, and the owner had painted over all of it, but that person had graffitied over what he had already painted.

1633
02:19:24,232 --> 02:19:29,414
[SPEAKER_23]: So in the span of a week, he had already painted the entire building.

1634
02:19:29,434 --> 02:19:31,395
[SPEAKER_23]: They wrapped around the entire side of the building.

1635
02:19:31,455 --> 02:19:33,997
[SPEAKER_23]: It was about a foot high, about 40 times.

1636
02:19:34,217 --> 02:19:36,938
[SPEAKER_23]: He signed his name, maybe

1637
02:19:37,513 --> 02:19:38,273
[SPEAKER_23]: We can find him.

1638
02:19:38,453 --> 02:19:40,294
[SPEAKER_23]: His name's on the building.

1639
02:19:40,754 --> 02:19:48,437
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's pretty upsetting that the owner was out there that quickly and repaired the damage and then it was done to him again.

1640
02:19:48,897 --> 02:19:50,998
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, this is probably a symptom of a larger issue.

1641
02:19:51,038 --> 02:19:55,899
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that the police force is down, density is up, and there's less patrol.

1642
02:19:55,959 --> 02:19:59,480
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a symptom and something that we really need to think about.

1643
02:19:59,941 --> 02:20:01,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we need more DPW?

1644
02:20:01,281 --> 02:20:02,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we need more police?

1645
02:20:04,674 --> 02:20:07,595
[SPEAKER_23]: is just a small level crime, but it is something to think about.

1646
02:20:07,615 --> 02:20:09,155
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1647
02:20:10,335 --> 02:20:10,695
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1648
02:20:10,835 --> 02:20:16,917
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor, all those opposed, motion carries.

1649
02:20:16,937 --> 02:20:32,660
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-661 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the Medford City Council is required to review and vote on the city budget each year, be it resolved that the city administration provide the Medford City Council budget versus actual budget information on a monthly basis.

1650
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:33,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor?

1651
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:35,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1652
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:38,701
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an issue that came up right around budget time.

1653
02:20:39,041 --> 02:20:41,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that I believe in.

1654
02:20:41,642 --> 02:20:47,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that, you know, it's one of our most important responsibilities is to pass the city budget each year.

1655
02:20:48,424 --> 02:20:50,365
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we're in the range of $162 million.

1656
02:20:50,625 --> 02:20:56,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but the budget process shouldn't be just in May and June.

1657
02:20:56,787 --> 02:20:58,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be continuous throughout the year.

1658
02:20:58,227 --> 02:21:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: We should know what's going on with the individual accounts, you know, where we stand, you know, after X amount of months.

1659
02:21:04,574 --> 02:21:08,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So the request is basically to get budget to actual details.

1660
02:21:09,016 --> 02:21:14,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I had asked for this in a previous meeting, and the administration said we were going to get it.

1661
02:21:14,679 --> 02:21:22,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't received it yet, but I did talk to, I said the chief of staff when I came into the meeting tonight, she told me that we will have it at the next meeting.

1662
02:21:23,104 --> 02:21:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's important, you know, one of our most important responsibilities is the budget.

1663
02:21:28,447 --> 02:21:32,689
[SPEAKER_03]: The budget should be an ongoing process where we're looking at it each month to see where we are.

1664
02:21:33,417 --> 02:21:40,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it's important to us that we keep an eye on the numbers each month and move for approval.

1665
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:43,811
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion approved by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1666
02:21:43,831 --> 02:21:44,091
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

1667
02:21:44,411 --> 02:21:46,692
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1668
02:21:46,912 --> 02:21:48,373
[SPEAKER_29]: The motion carries.

1669
02:21:48,393 --> 02:21:50,815
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-662, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1670
02:21:50,835 --> 02:22:02,561
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved that the administration update the Medford City Council with regard to what has been done over the last nine months to make City Hall more business friendly.

1671
02:22:03,342 --> 02:22:05,263
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1672
02:22:05,563 --> 02:22:06,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1673
02:22:07,304 --> 02:22:10,226
[SPEAKER_15]: This came up about six to nine months ago when

1674
02:22:11,903 --> 02:22:21,607
[SPEAKER_15]: The chicken and rice guys, I know they're one business that had posted with regards to it taking them nine to 12 months to obtain all their permits and their inspections.

1675
02:22:22,468 --> 02:22:28,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was a 12-month period that they had to go through within City Hall to make sure they were able to open business.

1676
02:22:29,771 --> 02:22:40,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And this city council voted that we, and I believe the mayor during campaigning also found this to be an issue, and the city council voted

1677
02:22:41,345 --> 02:22:48,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe six to nine months ago that we work better, work harder to make sure that it's easier to open a business.

1678
02:22:48,129 --> 02:23:03,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to know if we could get an update from the administration and the building department to see if anything's been done and a list of things that maybe have been done to make sure it's easier and we're being a little bit more business friendly than we had been with the prior administration.

1679
02:23:03,297 --> 02:23:08,500
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could just get a written update from both the building commissioner and the mayor's office.

1680
02:23:09,017 --> 02:23:11,960
[SPEAKER_15]: As to what's been done, they'll be helpful.

1681
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:15,103
[SPEAKER_29]: On that motion, Councilor Knight.

1682
02:23:15,683 --> 02:23:30,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, in our packets this evening, we have a letter dated September 20th, 2016 to the President and members of the Medford City Council from Stephanie M. Burke-Meyer regarding Resolution 16-662, Update on Enhancements to Communications and Relations with Business.

1683
02:23:31,192 --> 02:23:43,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, in response to Resolution 1662, I would like to update the Council on the actions that have been taken to improve relations and communications between the new and existing Medford businesses and City Hall.

1684
02:23:44,101 --> 02:23:59,112
[SPEAKER_22]: In January of 2016, I created the position of Business and Cultural Liaison to ensure that a dedicated staff member in the Mayor's Office is always equipped and available to work directly with businesses on any and all issues brought to our attention, as well as to spearhead important initiatives that will strengthen our relationship

1685
02:23:59,618 --> 02:24:02,720
[SPEAKER_22]: with and promote economic development within our business community.

1686
02:24:04,282 --> 02:24:13,729
[SPEAKER_22]: The first priority of this position, currently held by Ali Fisk, was to immediately open a line of communication between the city and the business associations in Medford, including the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

1687
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:27,720
[SPEAKER_22]: By attending numerous Chamber of Commerce government affairs meetings, as well as important membership meetings, Ali has gathered vital feedback from the businesses in an effort to elevate and evaluate business needs and ascertain ways that the city of Medford can better serve the business community.

1688
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:36,864
[SPEAKER_22]: This month, my office will be releasing the Medford Business Guide, an online and print booklet designed to guide individuals through the process of opening a new business in Medford.

1689
02:24:37,444 --> 02:24:46,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Depending on the type of business, this guide directs individuals to appropriate departments at City Hall, describes permitting processes, and provides individuals with links to online applications and other web resources.

1690
02:24:47,608 --> 02:24:55,992
[SPEAKER_22]: In February and March of 2016, the Business Economic Development Transition Team conducted community meetings in Medford's five key business districts,

1691
02:24:57,837 --> 02:25:03,938
[SPEAKER_22]: and engaged over 250 participants who contributed ideas about desired changes, upgrades, and initiatives in these regions.

1692
02:25:04,798 --> 02:25:15,821
[SPEAKER_22]: The report, entitled Shaping Medford Community Conversations to Guide Our Economic Future, breaks down suggested improvements by individual business square and makes suggestions for ways the city of Medford can support economic development.

1693
02:25:17,061 --> 02:25:26,243
[SPEAKER_22]: In September and October, I'll return to these squares with members of the transition team to meet with businesses and constituents and underscore some of the important findings and suggestions specific to individual business districts.

1694
02:25:26,954 --> 02:25:32,475
[SPEAKER_22]: This will be an opportunity to further engage in a deeper dialogue with the businesses and stakeholders in the region about other important initiatives.

1695
02:25:34,756 --> 02:25:46,978
[SPEAKER_22]: In an effort to improve customer service at City Hall for both businesses as well as for residents, all City Hall employees have attended a mandatory customer service training, which engaged employees in important dialogue and guidance regarding best practices in customer service.

1696
02:25:47,578 --> 02:25:54,920
[SPEAKER_22]: We're in the process of contracting for a new phone system, which will be implemented in four to six weeks, and it will include voicemail, an efficient intercom system,

1697
02:25:55,358 --> 02:25:59,081
[SPEAKER_22]: and will allow City Hall to streamline its communications and better respond to important inquiries.

1698
02:26:01,383 --> 02:26:08,229
[SPEAKER_22]: This fall, we will be relaunching the senior work off abatement program, which will match the skills of seniors living in Medford with the needs of departments in City Hall.

1699
02:26:08,489 --> 02:26:15,515
[SPEAKER_22]: These individuals will provide essential support to the departments and improve the staff's ability to provide adequate customer service in a timely manner as required.

1700
02:26:16,056 --> 02:26:19,679
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the many job positions will be a greeter at City Hall to assist all who enter.

1701
02:26:20,761 --> 02:26:25,244
[SPEAKER_22]: maintaining a strong and testing relationship with the business community is of the utmost importance to my administration.

1702
02:26:25,605 --> 02:26:29,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this letter outlines the important strides that have been taken to build these relationships over the next few months.

1703
02:26:29,968 --> 02:26:38,975
[SPEAKER_22]: We will continue to roll out other initiatives, maintain an open dialogue between my administration and business businesses and improve upon customer service systems that are in place here in city hall.

1704
02:26:39,695 --> 02:26:40,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Sincerely, mayor Stephanie and Burke.

1705
02:26:42,057 --> 02:26:42,377
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1706
02:26:42,417 --> 02:26:44,659
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor on the motion for approval.

1707
02:26:44,859 --> 02:26:45,680
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam vice president.

1708
02:26:46,219 --> 02:26:46,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1709
02:26:46,599 --> 02:26:47,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, no, I didn't see this.

1710
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:57,044
[SPEAKER_15]: We just received this today, but I thank the council for reading the letter from the mayor, and I thank the mayor for updating the council in advance of my resolution.

1711
02:26:57,084 --> 02:26:57,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

1712
02:26:58,005 --> 02:27:15,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I think all the initiatives are great, especially my resolution points to the Medford Business Guide, and I think that's the important part of it, not only having a guide for individuals who want to start a business and open a business in Medford, but also create a plan to make sure that

1713
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:19,422
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, when they do need inspections, they're done in a timely manner.

1714
02:27:19,883 --> 02:27:30,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank the mayor for this report and also just ask for an update from our building department with regards to timeliness of inspections upon request.

1715
02:27:30,630 --> 02:27:44,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we doing better than we used to do with regards to time frame and when inspectors are able to get out and, you know, fulfill requests for inspections just so that we know we can not only

1716
02:27:45,082 --> 02:27:49,924
[SPEAKER_15]: businesses getting the guy, but they're also getting, um, the inspections in a timely manner.

1717
02:27:50,084 --> 02:27:53,385
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think once we do that, we're more in a great path.

1718
02:27:54,946 --> 02:28:14,493
[SPEAKER_29]: And the motion for approval by vice president Lugo current, all those in favor of those opposed motion carries 16-six, uh, 63 offered by vice president Lugo current, uh, be resolved that the health director update that Medford city council with regards to where the city is at with inspections, as we were told in June,

1719
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:17,221
[SPEAKER_29]: that there was months behind.

1720
02:28:18,322 --> 02:28:19,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1721
02:28:19,663 --> 02:28:22,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I just move approval for this resolution.

1722
02:28:22,084 --> 02:28:32,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Back in June, during our budget hearings, we had met with the interim director of health or the health department, and I know he was trying to do the best he could.

1723
02:28:32,770 --> 02:28:35,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think they're working really hard on the health department.

1724
02:28:35,252 --> 02:28:40,695
[SPEAKER_15]: But one thing that did concern me was the fact that the city of Medford is behind on inspections.

1725
02:28:42,092 --> 02:28:42,372
[SPEAKER_15]: months.

1726
02:28:42,572 --> 02:28:44,292
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was months that was quoted to us.

1727
02:28:44,332 --> 02:28:55,774
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to make sure that, I mean, when we talk about, you know, the sanitary and health situations in the city of Medford, we just want to make sure inspections are, are done timely.

1728
02:28:55,994 --> 02:29:00,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, obviously all businesses are operating, um, up to code.

1729
02:29:00,795 --> 02:29:09,377
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get an update with regards to where we are with inspections and see how far behind we are, um, hopefully we're, we're catching out up from where we were in June.

1730
02:29:09,537 --> 02:29:10,377
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be appreciated.

1731
02:29:11,094 --> 02:29:13,015
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, it looks like everything's coming up roses.

1732
02:29:13,435 --> 02:29:15,616
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a new Director of the Board of Health.

1733
02:29:17,016 --> 02:29:17,416
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

1734
02:29:17,556 --> 02:29:19,717
[SPEAKER_29]: Please introduce yourself to the Medford City Council.

1735
02:29:19,977 --> 02:29:20,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1736
02:29:20,457 --> 02:29:20,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1737
02:29:20,957 --> 02:29:21,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Pleasure to be here.

1738
02:29:21,858 --> 02:29:25,639
[SPEAKER_13]: My name's Marian O'Connor and I'm your new Director of the Board of Health.

1739
02:29:26,349 --> 02:29:28,170
[SPEAKER_13]: been here just completed four weeks.

1740
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:30,491
[SPEAKER_13]: So getting to know my way around.

1741
02:29:30,812 --> 02:29:32,433
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I'm really happy to be here.

1742
02:29:32,493 --> 02:29:37,055
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly one of my priorities is to make sure that inspections are done in a timely manner.

1743
02:29:37,655 --> 02:29:39,637
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know there has been some backlog.

1744
02:29:40,457 --> 02:29:43,359
[SPEAKER_13]: I had actually asked our food inspector for an update last week.

1745
02:29:43,919 --> 02:29:48,081
[SPEAKER_13]: And according to what she's been able to provide for me so far, it looks like we're pretty close.

1746
02:29:48,121 --> 02:29:53,344
[SPEAKER_13]: We're over halfway there as far as catching up is needed since June.

1747
02:29:53,425 --> 02:29:54,705
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a good sign.

1748
02:29:54,785 --> 02:29:55,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And also we're looking

1749
02:29:56,437 --> 02:30:05,982
[SPEAKER_13]: to actually implement an automated system, so it'd be easy to track, easy to know what's outstanding, what's not getting done, and how quickly we're responding.

1750
02:30:06,282 --> 02:30:13,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, it's a little more difficult with the paper system and such to really, to stay on top of things, so we're really looking to kind of

1751
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:15,091
[SPEAKER_13]: to move things along here.

1752
02:30:15,192 --> 02:30:17,594
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, pleasure to see you.

1753
02:30:17,915 --> 02:30:18,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1754
02:30:18,696 --> 02:30:19,056
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1755
02:30:19,417 --> 02:30:20,278
[SPEAKER_29]: And welcome.

1756
02:30:20,298 --> 02:30:21,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Vice President.

1757
02:30:21,199 --> 02:30:21,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1758
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:27,166
[SPEAKER_15]: When you say an online system, is that going to be open to the public to see what you're doing in the department?

1759
02:30:27,226 --> 02:30:29,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Or can I, as a Councilor, log on?

1760
02:30:29,769 --> 02:30:30,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Will it be on the website?

1761
02:30:32,012 --> 02:30:32,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Not right now.

1762
02:30:33,127 --> 02:30:33,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Not right now.

1763
02:30:33,707 --> 02:30:40,351
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an internal system I'll have access to, that my inspectors will have access to, so I'll have better reporting available to me.

1764
02:30:40,711 --> 02:30:41,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly that would be a goal.

1765
02:30:42,532 --> 02:30:47,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And something we're looking at, it's just a pricing factor and a costing factor right now.

1766
02:30:47,414 --> 02:30:48,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be for all inspections.

1767
02:30:49,095 --> 02:30:51,176
[SPEAKER_13]: The first system we're getting is strictly for restaurants.

1768
02:30:53,037 --> 02:30:56,139
[SPEAKER_15]: And you said we're about halfway caught up from where we were behind.

1769
02:30:56,219 --> 02:30:59,481
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're still behind, but when are we looking to maybe... Still behind.

1770
02:30:59,521 --> 02:31:01,782
[SPEAKER_13]: We're about 90 inspections behind.

1771
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:06,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm figuring we can hopefully do four to five inspections a day.

1772
02:31:06,322 --> 02:31:08,723
[SPEAKER_13]: We should be able to get those out pretty quickly.

1773
02:31:08,743 --> 02:31:12,285
[SPEAKER_13]: If all staff are healthy and not on vacation.

1774
02:31:12,365 --> 02:31:15,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at about two to four months?

1775
02:31:15,907 --> 02:31:17,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully two months, hopefully not four.

1776
02:31:19,389 --> 02:31:20,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you for coming tonight.

1777
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:21,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the update.

1778
02:31:21,911 --> 02:31:22,171
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1779
02:31:22,551 --> 02:31:24,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

1780
02:31:24,832 --> 02:31:28,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought this issue up several months back regarding the outstanding

1781
02:31:31,223 --> 02:31:33,865
[SPEAKER_07]: number of renewals that were out there.

1782
02:31:34,926 --> 02:31:35,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said there's roughly 90?

1783
02:31:36,087 --> 02:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it looks like there were, there's a total of 259 that were needed to be done, and it looks like they've been able to complete 163, so 91 are still outstanding.

1784
02:31:48,157 --> 02:31:50,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And that runs by calendar year, correct?

1785
02:31:50,139 --> 02:31:51,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's by calendar year, right.

1786
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:55,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So from January to present, we were able to do what, a little over 100?

1787
02:31:56,264 --> 02:31:56,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks like 163, yeah.

1788
02:31:58,987 --> 02:32:01,369
[SPEAKER_13]: 163.

1789
02:31:59,007 --> 02:32:01,369
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one food inspector we have, right?

1790
02:32:02,289 --> 02:32:04,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And prior to that, we had multiple food inspectors?

1791
02:32:05,251 --> 02:32:08,232
[SPEAKER_13]: There was also one food inspector prior to that.

1792
02:32:08,512 --> 02:32:11,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there was a vacancy for a while, I think, in between food inspectors.

1793
02:32:12,314 --> 02:32:14,836
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a little bit of a vacancy within the last year.

1794
02:32:16,837 --> 02:32:18,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So just fill me in.

1795
02:32:18,978 --> 02:32:26,102
[SPEAKER_07]: When one of your inspectors go out and do an inspection, it's a thorough inspection of the premises, the kitchen,

1796
02:32:27,171 --> 02:32:27,651
[SPEAKER_07]: and so forth.

1797
02:32:27,812 --> 02:32:29,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, for a food inspection, it's different.

1798
02:32:29,753 --> 02:32:31,234
[SPEAKER_13]: We do what's called risk-based.

1799
02:32:31,875 --> 02:32:36,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, there's a requirement by the state that all restaurants are done twice a year.

1800
02:32:36,978 --> 02:32:39,080
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you go risk-based, you can change that.

1801
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:46,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So your gas station that sells candy bars and Coca-Cola, you can call that a type one risk.

1802
02:32:46,265 --> 02:32:48,247
[SPEAKER_13]: So that only requires one inspection a year.

1803
02:32:48,707 --> 02:32:49,708
[SPEAKER_13]: But then you go from there.

1804
02:32:50,168 --> 02:32:53,611
[SPEAKER_13]: So your retail food, like your pizza place and stuff, they'd be a type two.

1805
02:32:53,631 --> 02:32:55,432
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to have to get to them at least twice a year.

1806
02:32:56,966 --> 02:33:03,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Retail foods like full-blown restaurants, sushi, more elaborate kitchens, they'd require three inspections a year.

1807
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:09,914
[SPEAKER_13]: And then your most at-risk populations, like nursing homes, hospitals, those types of folks, they'd be what's called a type four.

1808
02:33:10,454 --> 02:33:12,296
[SPEAKER_13]: So they require four inspections a year.

1809
02:33:12,956 --> 02:33:16,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So the number outstanding now, is it a combination of all those different?

1810
02:33:16,338 --> 02:33:17,979
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a combination of all of those, right.

1811
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:24,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do we say to consumers that are going out into these establishments that haven't been inspected?

1812
02:33:24,964 --> 02:33:25,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.

1813
02:33:25,974 --> 02:33:27,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Something that's certainly going to get on top of.

1814
02:33:28,095 --> 02:33:32,717
[SPEAKER_13]: From what I can tell, all these establishments have been inspected at least once, if not twice.

1815
02:33:33,057 --> 02:33:37,398
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your higher risk-based ones that we've done actually the better job on.

1816
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:41,280
[SPEAKER_13]: So the higher ones that are outstanding are your type ones.

1817
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:45,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's 40 out of the 91, 44 are type ones that are outstanding.

1818
02:33:46,302 --> 02:33:51,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's your prepackaged foods, your Coca-Colas, very low risk of foodborne illness.

1819
02:33:51,344 --> 02:33:52,684
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what these types are.

1820
02:33:52,764 --> 02:33:54,245
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your risk of foodborne illness.

1821
02:33:54,942 --> 02:34:00,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Your type threes and your type fours are where you'll have more exposure or more possibility of being exposed for foodborne illness.

1822
02:34:01,303 --> 02:34:04,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Type ones, minimal exposure because they're not preparing food.

1823
02:34:04,944 --> 02:34:05,904
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not touching food.

1824
02:34:05,944 --> 02:34:07,044
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all prepackaged.

1825
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:10,645
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a matter of making sure it's cleanly and that type of thing.

1826
02:34:10,705 --> 02:34:12,705
[SPEAKER_13]: But your risk is a lot lower.

1827
02:34:13,606 --> 02:34:21,167
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so we're looking to, uh, so we've, we've really concentrated on the type from what I can see on the type threes and the type fours, which is good, good news.

1828
02:34:21,530 --> 02:34:25,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so, uh, on the council agenda tonight, we're looking to implement a food trucks.

1829
02:34:26,572 --> 02:34:31,976
[SPEAKER_07]: which is gonna add possibly another 20, 30, 40 different trucks throughout the community.

1830
02:34:32,717 --> 02:34:38,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, you don't even have the capability of completing what we have currently in the brick and mortar establishments.

1831
02:34:39,923 --> 02:34:43,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there a recommendation to add a staff person to your office?

1832
02:34:43,966 --> 02:34:48,009
[SPEAKER_13]: There has been, and I've actually had discussions with the mayor's office already.

1833
02:34:48,050 --> 02:34:55,916
[SPEAKER_13]: In my form, the interim director, Richard Marino, that was one of his suggestions as he left, was that we really needed an additional inspector.

1834
02:34:57,950 --> 02:35:00,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is the fee to a business for the inspection?

1835
02:35:01,493 --> 02:35:03,595
[SPEAKER_13]: It varies on how many permits they have.

1836
02:35:03,655 --> 02:35:04,816
[SPEAKER_13]: There's different permit fees.

1837
02:35:04,836 --> 02:35:05,316
[SPEAKER_13]: There's milk.

1838
02:35:05,396 --> 02:35:06,397
[SPEAKER_13]: There's full-blown.

1839
02:35:06,477 --> 02:35:08,279
[SPEAKER_13]: So it varies.

1840
02:35:08,539 --> 02:35:09,019
[SPEAKER_13]: An average?

1841
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:09,019
100, 100.

1842
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:11,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Could be 100 to 150, I believe.

1843
02:35:12,322 --> 02:35:14,824
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you go out, do you prorate it?

1844
02:35:14,884 --> 02:35:17,406
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're there six months late, do you prorate the fee?

1845
02:35:18,067 --> 02:35:19,168
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the permit's for a year.

1846
02:35:19,268 --> 02:35:21,490
[SPEAKER_13]: So you operate the permit even without the inspection.

1847
02:35:21,530 --> 02:35:24,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they should have an inspection, obviously, if they're a new business.

1848
02:35:24,712 --> 02:35:26,834
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get a permit based on the inspection, right?

1849
02:35:27,525 --> 02:35:32,186
[SPEAKER_13]: You come in and file for a permit, then your inspection is scheduled, so.

1850
02:35:32,826 --> 02:35:36,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but ideally it's supposed to happen pretty close to each other, right?

1851
02:35:36,427 --> 02:35:37,548
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be ideal, yes.

1852
02:35:38,388 --> 02:35:45,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're charging business owners that are six months into their year a permit that wasn't really inspected.

1853
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:49,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the city of Medford didn't give a proper inspection.

1854
02:35:50,491 --> 02:35:51,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see a problem with that?

1855
02:35:52,032 --> 02:35:53,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, I do, yes.

1856
02:35:54,382 --> 02:35:56,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully that's what we're here to fix.

1857
02:35:56,943 --> 02:35:59,164
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been uncovering quite a bit.

1858
02:35:59,224 --> 02:36:01,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen it this bad, to be quite honest.

1859
02:36:01,864 --> 02:36:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been around the council a number of years.

1860
02:36:03,565 --> 02:36:04,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen it this bad.

1861
02:36:04,965 --> 02:36:07,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I was pretty surprised at what I walked into, yes.

1862
02:36:08,066 --> 02:36:10,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to admit, yes.

1863
02:36:10,607 --> 02:36:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've had business owners contact me and say it's been five months, I don't have my permit yet.

1864
02:36:16,509 --> 02:36:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have people reaching?

1865
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:19,290
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have their permit?

1866
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:19,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Their inspection.

1867
02:36:20,965 --> 02:36:24,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have people, the inspection's a separate certificate, right?

1868
02:36:25,608 --> 02:36:26,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and most people put that up.

1869
02:36:26,849 --> 02:36:27,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You're required to put it up, aren't you?

1870
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:28,691
[SPEAKER_13]: You're required to put that up, yes.

1871
02:36:28,711 --> 02:36:32,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so have you had business owners reach out to you and say, hey, what's going on?

1872
02:36:32,954 --> 02:36:35,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm worried that I'm not in compliance.

1873
02:36:36,396 --> 02:36:36,556
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1874
02:36:37,397 --> 02:36:38,438
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just call the council?

1875
02:36:38,478 --> 02:36:39,478
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't call the Board of Health?

1876
02:36:39,719 --> 02:36:43,962
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as I know, we don't have people asking to be inspected.

1877
02:36:45,622 --> 02:36:53,885
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have people that are concerned that have been around a long time know that there's inspections that take place and the city is nowhere to be found.

1878
02:36:55,106 --> 02:36:56,766
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's a concern.

1879
02:36:56,886 --> 02:36:58,547
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big concern.

1880
02:36:58,627 --> 02:37:08,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we bring on a temporary food inspector to assist in this rather than saying, well, it might be another two months because too much, you know, is three months, four months.

1881
02:37:08,651 --> 02:37:11,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it gets around the holidays and doesn't move as quick.

1882
02:37:12,358 --> 02:37:12,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love that.

1883
02:37:12,818 --> 02:37:15,280
[SPEAKER_13]: That's certainly something I will explore with the mayor's office.

1884
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:25,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'd ask that we make a recommendation as a council on behalf of not only the businesses, but every resident in this community that frequents a restaurant in this community.

1885
02:37:26,048 --> 02:37:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that, uh, you know, the board of health's doing their job.

1886
02:37:29,471 --> 02:37:38,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and, and here we go tonight, uh, saying that we may introduce food trucks in the community, which requires the same scrutiny.

1887
02:37:39,338 --> 02:37:41,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we don't have the manpower to cover what we have.

1888
02:37:42,640 --> 02:38:00,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would ask that the administration, Mr. President, we saw in the papers tonight we have $8 million in surplus money that they hire a temporary food enforcement officer to assist the Board of Health until we can get this number down to where it should be, Mr. President.

1889
02:38:00,644 --> 02:38:02,284
[SPEAKER_29]: So that would be my recommendation.

1890
02:38:02,324 --> 02:38:05,505
[SPEAKER_29]: The motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilor Marks.

1891
02:38:06,845 --> 02:38:08,765
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

1892
02:38:09,265 --> 02:38:10,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1893
02:38:10,806 --> 02:38:12,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That was going to be my recommendation.

1894
02:38:14,274 --> 02:38:16,876
[SPEAKER_05]: bring in someone temporary to at least get you by.

1895
02:38:18,037 --> 02:38:21,500
[SPEAKER_05]: The other inspectors in the office, they're not certified to do food?

1896
02:38:22,341 --> 02:38:28,066
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one other inspector in the office and she's pretty tied up with complaints and sanitary issues and housing.

1897
02:38:28,086 --> 02:38:30,748
[SPEAKER_13]: She also does the housing inspections as well.

1898
02:38:32,069 --> 02:38:36,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So she can cover if necessary, but she's got a pretty heavy workload herself.

1899
02:38:37,534 --> 02:38:39,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would assume at budget time you're going to be looking for

1900
02:38:40,558 --> 02:38:41,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Some additional staff?

1901
02:38:41,599 --> 02:38:43,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly will, yes.

1902
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:49,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I would support Councilor Marks' motion that the city bring on a temporary inspector to get you through these times right now.

1903
02:38:50,144 --> 02:38:50,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1904
02:38:51,665 --> 02:38:53,446
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Kurt.

1905
02:38:54,427 --> 02:38:54,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1906
02:38:55,067 --> 02:38:56,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one more amendment.

1907
02:38:56,909 --> 02:38:57,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1908
02:38:57,089 --> 02:39:01,572
[SPEAKER_15]: O'Connor, if you could give us an update in two months just to see where we're at, a detailed update.

1909
02:39:02,052 --> 02:39:02,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1910
02:39:02,432 --> 02:39:02,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1911
02:39:02,953 --> 02:39:03,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1912
02:39:04,178 --> 02:39:11,206
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilors Mox and Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Marks?

1913
02:39:11,947 --> 02:39:18,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a current listing with the outstanding permit, whether it's permit 1, 2, 3 that you were describing.

1914
02:39:19,171 --> 02:39:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And this wasn't reflect.

1915
02:39:20,772 --> 02:39:25,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize you've only been here four weeks, but there's a frustration that's been going on for a lot of months now.

1916
02:39:25,894 --> 02:39:26,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand.

1917
02:39:26,815 --> 02:39:29,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly as the Board of Health, we're very frustrated as well.

1918
02:39:29,696 --> 02:39:30,557
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that we want.

1919
02:39:30,797 --> 02:39:31,677
[SPEAKER_07]: These are important issues.

1920
02:39:31,737 --> 02:39:34,899
[SPEAKER_29]: Updated listing on the outstanding inspections.

1921
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:39,782
[SPEAKER_07]: The type of outstanding that the business itself won the last time it was inspected.

1922
02:39:40,802 --> 02:39:42,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have just paper reporting.

1923
02:39:43,824 --> 02:39:49,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the automated system right now, it's mixed, so it's a little bit harder to determine.

1924
02:39:52,394 --> 02:40:00,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not all paper, but my understanding is it's not always reliable, the software that we currently have, so we're working with trying to figure that out as well.

1925
02:40:00,443 --> 02:40:03,487
[SPEAKER_13]: But the new software will make reporting much easier.

1926
02:40:03,718 --> 02:40:06,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and plus you're gonna be getting voicemail pretty soon, too.

1927
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:06,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1928
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:09,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something brand new.

1929
02:40:09,762 --> 02:40:10,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Voicemail just came out.

1930
02:40:11,643 --> 02:40:13,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're gonna be getting that at City Hall, too.

1931
02:40:13,464 --> 02:40:16,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're updating the paper files, you can have your voicemail.

1932
02:40:16,446 --> 02:40:16,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1933
02:40:17,067 --> 02:40:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're moving forward.

1934
02:40:18,888 --> 02:40:20,989
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval as amended.

1935
02:40:21,109 --> 02:40:21,970
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

1936
02:40:22,630 --> 02:40:23,331
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1937
02:40:23,391 --> 02:40:24,071
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1938
02:40:24,471 --> 02:40:27,313
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much and welcome.

1939
02:40:27,333 --> 02:40:29,795
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-664 offered by Vice President Luggo-Kern.

1940
02:40:30,395 --> 02:40:33,217
[SPEAKER_29]: Be resolved that due to the last quarterly Massport meeting

1941
02:40:33,651 --> 02:40:42,817
[SPEAKER_29]: being canceled and postponed, be it resolved that Medford's appointee to that committee be invited to update the council at our council meeting on October 4th.

1942
02:40:43,398 --> 02:40:44,298
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Vice President.

1943
02:40:44,699 --> 02:40:46,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1944
02:40:46,340 --> 02:40:58,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I did draft my resolution to hope that the representative would be here tonight, but then I spoke to the city clerk, who thankfully called me, to let me know that the meeting, Massport meeting, was canceled.

1945
02:40:58,968 --> 02:41:01,330
[SPEAKER_15]: It was supposed to take place, I believe, the beginning of September.

1946
02:41:01,937 --> 02:41:03,858
[SPEAKER_15]: so there really wasn't much of an update.

1947
02:41:05,038 --> 02:41:15,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I just think this is an extremely important issue and I want it on the agenda because repeatedly, I don't know, I'm sure the rest of the council is getting calls as well, if not hearing the airplanes themselves.

1948
02:41:17,483 --> 02:41:31,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Numerous complaints, repeated complaints coming in with regards to, it's not every night, but when you have a night that they're flying on that certain lane, I don't have all my paperwork with me, flying on that certain lane,

1949
02:41:31,839 --> 02:41:35,220
[SPEAKER_15]: It is every few minutes, and it is disturbing.

1950
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:38,941
[SPEAKER_15]: I know people who have migraines from it.

1951
02:41:39,561 --> 02:41:40,781
[SPEAKER_15]: It's woken me up at night.

1952
02:41:40,841 --> 02:41:42,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm up in the side of the heights.

1953
02:41:42,561 --> 02:41:51,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really, if you're affected, if your home or your area is affected, you are affected all night long, every three minutes.

1954
02:41:51,603 --> 02:41:56,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are a little higher than others, but there's some that shake your house.

1955
02:41:56,605 --> 02:41:58,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's really important to get

1956
02:41:59,682 --> 02:42:00,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Attorney Glaiona here.

1957
02:42:00,943 --> 02:42:04,145
[SPEAKER_15]: He's Medford's representative to this Massport.

1958
02:42:04,805 --> 02:42:14,590
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I know that last meeting when I spoke about this, Mr. Glaiona was in touch with the state delegation and was also attending this meeting.

1959
02:42:14,691 --> 02:42:16,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So this council needs an update.

1960
02:42:16,592 --> 02:42:27,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we've had residents here explaining that no more than the council does, explaining what we should do as a city and how we need to complain more to Massport because the complaints are going to be calculated when they review.

1961
02:42:28,485 --> 02:42:47,554
[SPEAKER_15]: the city of Medford and how the airplanes are affecting us, which I think is supposed to take place in the spring possibly, but to have a resident say it and to have a representative that has been to these meetings to let us know what can be done and what we as a council and as a city can do to try to alleviate this.

1962
02:42:47,754 --> 02:42:49,174
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it kind of dies down.

1963
02:42:49,214 --> 02:42:53,056
[SPEAKER_15]: The complaints will die down over the winter because everybody's windows will definitely be closed.

1964
02:42:53,096 --> 02:42:55,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody will be in their backyards barbecuing.

1965
02:42:55,485 --> 02:42:58,447
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, this affects people still, even when the windows are closed.

1966
02:42:58,507 --> 02:43:00,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's an extremely important issue.

1967
02:43:00,468 --> 02:43:03,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And we need to do something.

1968
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:06,152
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to make sure that administration is on it.

1969
02:43:06,292 --> 02:43:11,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And please, if we could get this representative here, first meeting in October would be very helpful.

1970
02:43:11,755 --> 02:43:15,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's something that we've been promising the people for months now.

1971
02:43:15,498 --> 02:43:17,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, people have dealt with this all summer long.

1972
02:43:18,139 --> 02:43:19,440
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we're into fall.

1973
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:21,822
[SPEAKER_15]: And just an update would be great.

1974
02:43:22,122 --> 02:43:22,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1975
02:43:22,923 --> 02:43:26,986
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

1976
02:43:27,486 --> 02:43:28,227
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

1977
02:43:28,327 --> 02:43:29,027
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

1978
02:43:30,188 --> 02:43:34,211
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved, 16-665 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1979
02:43:34,812 --> 02:43:44,358
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it resolved that the administration update Medford City Council as to what has been done by the city to ensure that the Malden Hospital site is not overdeveloped.

1980
02:43:44,759 --> 02:43:45,659
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Vice President.

1981
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:48,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1982
02:43:48,762 --> 02:43:49,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I put this on

1983
02:43:51,112 --> 02:43:56,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one, there is a meeting, and I think everybody should be apprised of it, the council and the public as well.

1984
02:43:57,357 --> 02:44:06,984
[SPEAKER_15]: This area, the Malden Hospital site, it affects, I mean, the Heights, North Medford, but it also, I mean, traffic's gonna linger into our whole community.

1985
02:44:07,324 --> 02:44:13,549
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole city of Medford's gonna be affected by the multiple unit development that is being proposed at that location.

1986
02:44:14,309 --> 02:44:20,934
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a meeting, I believe the developer, and I could be corrected, but the developer is having a meeting at the Malden Hospital site, on site,

1987
02:44:21,207 --> 02:44:25,049
[SPEAKER_15]: this Thursday night, September 22nd at 6 p.m.

1988
02:44:25,989 --> 02:44:48,639
[SPEAKER_15]: And from what I understand, and I know we have representatives from the Felsmere group who's been working very hard to downsize this project and create a plan that will better suit the residents and the area and the traffic and the redevelopment, can definitely explain it better, but I believe there's a moratorium on building

1989
02:44:49,568 --> 02:44:54,352
[SPEAKER_15]: in Malden, and that moratorium is up within the next couple months.

1990
02:44:54,552 --> 02:44:57,234
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're looking at possible permits being issued.

1991
02:44:57,654 --> 02:45:04,259
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what type of variance, where they are in the stage, but we're looking at possible approval of a project.

1992
02:45:04,939 --> 02:45:15,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the development was downsized minimally, minimally, and I say it lightly, not enough in the last, by the developer, and I think that's what's gonna be proposed on Thursday night.

1993
02:45:17,022 --> 02:45:30,629
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to know from the administration standpoint, I know that myself and Lauren DiLorenzo, Office of Community Development, was at a meeting or two at the BB School in Malden back a year ago with a number of Medford residents.

1994
02:45:31,050 --> 02:45:35,452
[SPEAKER_15]: But what else has the city done to ensure and to safeguard?

1995
02:45:35,532 --> 02:45:42,596
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we only have three, I believe three acres of the 18 is on Medford property and all the building will be on Malden.

1996
02:45:42,656 --> 02:45:44,197
[SPEAKER_15]: So what are we doing to make sure

1997
02:45:44,671 --> 02:45:50,133
[SPEAKER_15]: that our two mayors are discussing this and trying to work together and what else can be done.

1998
02:45:50,293 --> 02:46:07,639
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to see where we're at, what has the office, so if we could get an update from the administration and the Office of Community Development to see where we're at and if the Office of Community Development has been in talks with Malden and what's been done to ensure and try to push this project to be downsized even more.

1999
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:12,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously the traffic, you can not get down Fulton Street some mornings.

2000
02:46:13,932 --> 02:46:19,235
[SPEAKER_15]: 25 minutes, you know, that's obviously my neighborhood, but I'm trying to get down Fulton Street.

2001
02:46:19,896 --> 02:46:22,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't believe I'm gonna be late for school and it should take me three minutes.

2002
02:46:23,398 --> 02:46:27,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Nevermind, you know, Elm Street, trying to get on 93, forget about it.

2003
02:46:28,961 --> 02:46:41,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Murray Hill Road, and those Murray Hill Road residents are the ones that were at our ad hoc meeting for the Malden redevelopment anyway, so we are having some serious, you know,

2004
02:46:42,518 --> 02:46:44,319
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have some serious traffic problems.

2005
02:46:44,419 --> 02:46:50,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's what our ad hoc meeting discussed months ago, and we do have to schedule another one.

2006
02:46:50,742 --> 02:47:07,831
[SPEAKER_15]: But before we do so, I just want to get an update from the administration, because I know we have to make some changes if this is going to go forward with our roads, whether it be making one-way streets or making sure the road is continued to be blocked off.

2007
02:47:07,891 --> 02:47:10,272
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's things that we need to do, and I think it's

2008
02:47:10,712 --> 02:47:12,913
[SPEAKER_15]: much larger than a city council's job.

2009
02:47:12,953 --> 02:47:15,034
[SPEAKER_15]: So what is the city as a whole doing?

2010
02:47:15,114 --> 02:47:37,485
[SPEAKER_29]: What is our office of community develop doing to, to work on this and make sure they're apprised of what's going on on the motion for approval by vice president level current, all those in favor, all those opposed motion carries 16-six, six, six offered by vice president Lungo-Koehn be resolved that the Medford city council discuss a moratorium

2011
02:47:38,087 --> 02:47:47,549
[SPEAKER_29]: on building until a well-thought-out plan can be put in place with input from the residents on how to proceed with smart development.

2012
02:47:47,569 --> 02:47:48,610
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam Vice President.

2013
02:47:49,230 --> 02:47:50,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

2014
02:47:51,210 --> 02:47:55,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I put this on to create a discussion with regards to building in our community.

2015
02:47:55,731 --> 02:47:59,292
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a number of different projects that have taken place already.

2016
02:47:59,412 --> 02:48:03,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are in the works, some are waiting for their permits, some are

2017
02:48:04,105 --> 02:48:08,566
[SPEAKER_15]: getting ready to go for the planning board and eventually the zoning board of appeals.

2018
02:48:09,126 --> 02:48:15,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think this is an issue that needs some community input.

2019
02:48:17,027 --> 02:48:21,228
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Luminaire that went in, we have Middlesex Ave that's underway.

2020
02:48:21,248 --> 02:48:27,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're talking hundreds of units, apartments and condos being put into the community.

2021
02:48:27,729 --> 02:48:33,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like people are on top of it now and people obviously are very concerned about

2022
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:38,222
[SPEAKER_15]: our infrastructure, the traffic, our school system.

2023
02:48:39,962 --> 02:48:52,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe there's any room left at the Robertson McGlynn with regards to classroom size to add additional classrooms, yet we have hundreds and hundreds of units being proposed or currently in the works.

2024
02:48:52,648 --> 02:48:59,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's time we sit back and decide, with the help of the community, what are we looking for?

2025
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:03,072
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the big plan of the city, and where do we see it going?

2026
02:49:03,526 --> 02:49:17,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Because right now we're looking, I mean, we're heading towards looking more like Boston, maybe even New York City with the amount of construction and units going in with the amount of traffic that we already have.

2027
02:49:17,977 --> 02:49:29,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a well thought out plan with smart development needs to be put in place so that the administration and the city council and the board of appeals and the residents are all on the same page.

2028
02:49:30,617 --> 02:49:32,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now, I don't think that's where we're at.

2029
02:49:32,698 --> 02:49:45,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the administration wants high density, yet we have these, you know, when we talked about one of the last projects, we had 100 people in this room not wanting high density in their neighborhoods.

2030
02:49:46,265 --> 02:49:48,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're kind of all over the place.

2031
02:49:48,966 --> 02:49:56,630
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the Canal Street project with 30-unit proposal where the Board of Appeals voted to deny that project, asking them to downsize.

2032
02:49:57,107 --> 02:50:04,731
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have other projects like Lumineer with 165 units that were given variances, as many variances as they wanted.

2033
02:50:04,851 --> 02:50:09,954
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, where are we at, and where are we looking to bring this whole city with regards to development?

2034
02:50:10,814 --> 02:50:20,019
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether that's a moratorium, like I just discussed, Malden had to put in place, whether that's a group meeting, something needs to be done.

2035
02:50:20,719 --> 02:50:24,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the people are outraged, and I think it's time that the council

2036
02:50:24,566 --> 02:50:25,646
[SPEAKER_15]: really think about it.

2037
02:50:25,866 --> 02:50:35,109
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even asking to take a vote necessarily tonight, but what can be done to make sure that we don't have what we had a couple months ago happen again?

2038
02:50:43,031 --> 02:50:44,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2039
02:50:45,131 --> 02:50:51,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I certainly think that we've all had discussions here behind this rail about development in the city of Medford, what direction the city of Medford's going in.

2040
02:50:53,895 --> 02:51:09,346
[SPEAKER_22]: what we'd like to see happen in our community, whether or not we want to remain a bedroom community, whether or not we want to be a hybrid bedroom community and a place with vibrant downtowns, or whether we want to be a full-blown extension of Somerville, really, is what it's coming into, Mr. President.

2041
02:51:10,407 --> 02:51:18,773
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that being said, I think that there are a number of questions that need to be answered, and I think that this would be a perfect measure to further examine and discuss at the subcommittee level.

2042
02:51:19,544 --> 02:51:26,828
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to hear from the Office of Economic Development to see what concerns they have about issuing a moratorium on building development would be.

2043
02:51:27,228 --> 02:51:34,332
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to hear from the Community Assistance Unit from the Department of Housing and Community Development at the state level to see if they can provide us with technical assistance.

2044
02:51:34,492 --> 02:51:43,917
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've already been working hand-in-hand with the MAPC in terms of our Safe Streets Program and some other matters that we're discussing, like the revitalization of Medford Square, Mr. President.

2045
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:55,568
[SPEAKER_22]: So I certainly feel as though further discussion is warranted on this topic, and I feel as though further discussion is warranted at the subcommittee level in the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee, and I'd like to amend the motion to refer them out of there.

2046
02:51:58,230 --> 02:52:05,655
[SPEAKER_29]: On the main motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli.

2047
02:52:06,435 --> 02:52:06,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2048
02:52:08,175 --> 02:52:11,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Kern and I appreciate that.

2049
02:52:11,456 --> 02:52:28,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, um, you know, I, I, when we were having discussions, deep, uh, discussions with our zoning and our ordinances and our building, I know that I made the motion that we asked the mayor, uh, about looking into the metropolitan planning board.

2050
02:52:28,122 --> 02:52:34,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we were doing that with Medford square, but they, they, you know, to, to add to that as part of a committee, the whole meeting,

2051
02:52:35,738 --> 02:52:44,722
[SPEAKER_10]: would be to investigate or bring someone in from the MPB to discuss looking into zoning and ordinances.

2052
02:52:45,422 --> 02:53:02,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I know that I believe Councilor Falco mentioned to come in and do a whole study on that, but we have an opportunity on the money that we've already paid them to come in and do that study for us and to look at

2053
02:53:04,645 --> 02:53:06,267
[SPEAKER_10]: all of these issues as well as a whole.

2054
02:53:06,367 --> 02:53:20,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would, if we can amend that to also, um, ask the mayor to look into the metropolitan planning board to, um, join us in that committee, the whole meeting and help us guide a plan, uh, set a plan.

2055
02:53:20,861 --> 02:53:21,341
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

2056
02:53:25,265 --> 02:53:25,605
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2057
02:53:25,665 --> 02:53:28,348
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Scarpelli chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

2058
02:53:29,767 --> 02:53:35,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to echo the comments that Councilor Scarpelli just stated.

2059
02:53:36,730 --> 02:53:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Councilor Scarpelli several months back that asked for a moratorium that it be looked at, and the Metropolitan Planning Board, I think, is a great suggestion.

2060
02:53:49,575 --> 02:53:53,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Councilor Falco mentioned about possibly bringing on a consultant,

2061
02:53:53,937 --> 02:53:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Metropolitan Planning Board can at least assist us.

2062
02:53:57,820 --> 02:54:01,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the most important functions of this council is zoning.

2063
02:54:02,283 --> 02:54:05,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And zoning is the lifeblood of the community.

2064
02:54:05,585 --> 02:54:09,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could talk about what the city is going to look like, the future, this and that.

2065
02:54:09,955 --> 02:54:12,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the zoning that lays the foundation.

2066
02:54:12,678 --> 02:54:25,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really this council that needs to sit down, sit down with the Metropolitan Planning Board, maybe a consultant, whoever it might be, and start the process of reviewing our zoning ordinance.

2067
02:54:25,650 --> 02:54:32,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go up and down Salem Street, for instance, and there may be seven different zoning districts on Salem Street alone.

2068
02:54:33,256 --> 02:54:43,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the things I think that we as a council have to say, okay, we want to know what the direction's going to be, but we also have to lay out a framework.

2069
02:54:44,104 --> 02:54:46,406
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to lay out a framework by the Meadow Glen Mall.

2070
02:54:46,846 --> 02:54:47,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it housing?

2071
02:54:47,987 --> 02:54:48,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it commercial?

2072
02:54:49,348 --> 02:54:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: What is industrial what what what are our thoughts mystic F?

2073
02:54:53,411 --> 02:54:54,792
[SPEAKER_07]: What are our thoughts on mystic F?

2074
02:54:55,172 --> 02:55:06,601
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the things I think honestly and it's a difficult subject to broach But these are the things we have to just Scott and and and hey I've been on the council probably one of the longest and This council's been neglecting doing it

2075
02:55:07,239 --> 02:55:10,224
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not revisited our zoning in years.

2076
02:55:10,966 --> 02:55:18,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last really zoning substance was when Councilor Panter-Mayocco did the zoning for Station Landing, and that was back some years ago.

2077
02:55:20,265 --> 02:55:44,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So really there hasn't been any meaningful dialogue, so I think committee the whole is fine, but I think the zoning Subcommittee has to get together and we do need some I'm not an expert in it by any stretch I think we need some advice and some you know someone to lead us in the process So I agree with councillor Scarpelli that I think that's a good way of moving forward and if the mayor doesn't see fit to

2078
02:55:44,553 --> 02:55:49,836
[SPEAKER_07]: move forward, we're the council, we're the legislative body, we're in charge of zoning.

2079
02:55:50,136 --> 02:55:51,397
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need to wait for the mayor.

2080
02:55:52,638 --> 02:55:55,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll drive the bus and the mayor will be a passenger.

2081
02:55:55,859 --> 02:55:56,680
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll drive the bus.

2082
02:55:57,740 --> 02:55:58,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2083
02:56:02,223 --> 02:56:03,263
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

2084
02:56:03,624 --> 02:56:05,345
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

2085
02:56:05,605 --> 02:56:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2086
02:56:07,286 --> 02:56:09,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to say I agree with my council colleagues.

2087
02:56:10,065 --> 02:56:13,228
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, zoning is one of our most important responsibilities.

2088
02:56:13,248 --> 02:56:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be looked at.

2089
02:56:14,368 --> 02:56:16,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be looked at sooner than later.

2090
02:56:16,110 --> 02:56:26,118
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we, it seems like, you know, month after month, we keep hearing about developers that want to come in and build and build and build, and they're seeking all kinds of variances.

2091
02:56:26,758 --> 02:56:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so we need to jump on top of this.

2092
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:30,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And Council Member Mox is right.

2093
02:56:30,561 --> 02:56:32,663
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of our most important responsibilities.

2094
02:56:32,943 --> 02:56:35,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to get on top of this sooner than later.

2095
02:56:35,285 --> 02:56:37,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's correct.

2096
02:56:37,647 --> 02:56:39,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoning has not been looked at.

2097
02:56:39,798 --> 02:56:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: in this city for close to probably, I mean, with the exception of the stations landing area, I talked to someone the other day and they said it was probably close to 40, if not 50 years.

2098
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:50,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it has been a very long time.

2099
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:53,580
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take a look at the zoning maps, they're very dated.

2100
02:56:54,060 --> 02:56:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be looked at and it needs to be looked at now.

2101
02:56:56,981 --> 02:57:00,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanna go on the record of saying, you know, I support my colleagues.

2102
02:57:00,182 --> 02:57:02,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something we need to look at sooner than later.

2103
02:57:03,302 --> 02:57:08,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I look forward to working with the subcommittee that's gonna work on that, the zoning subcommittee.

2104
02:57:09,465 --> 02:57:11,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we will be looking at that soon.

2105
02:57:11,186 --> 02:57:22,192
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you Thank You council Falco chair recognizes the citizen at the podium Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

2106
02:57:22,292 --> 02:57:36,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 281 Park Street and I encourage a moratorium on building because sorry right now there are over 800 units that are approved and either under construction or or pending permits and

2107
02:57:37,382 --> 02:57:41,403
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're all on the side of the city where the McGlynn and the Roberts are.

2108
02:57:42,044 --> 02:57:45,285
[SPEAKER_23]: The McGlynn and the Roberts are the most highly populated schools in the city.

2109
02:57:45,785 --> 02:57:47,986
[SPEAKER_23]: I met with the principal at the Roberts on Friday.

2110
02:57:48,246 --> 02:57:50,387
[SPEAKER_23]: The numbers that he had given to the school committee were 547.

2111
02:57:50,427 --> 02:57:54,148
[SPEAKER_23]: He's now, as of Friday, he was up to 555.

2112
02:57:56,149 --> 02:57:58,589
[SPEAKER_23]: He gets new students almost daily.

2113
02:57:59,070 --> 02:58:00,290
[SPEAKER_23]: That school is very full.

2114
02:58:01,317 --> 02:58:02,418
[SPEAKER_23]: The McGlynn School is at 495.

2115
02:58:03,699 --> 02:58:07,942
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go across town, you'll see the Columbus is at 401, the Brooks is at 449.

2116
02:58:08,643 --> 02:58:13,667
[SPEAKER_23]: So the school populations do need to be considered in approving building projects.

2117
02:58:14,107 --> 02:58:22,393
[SPEAKER_23]: If 10% of these new units have one child, that's 80 new children, that will go to the Roberts or the Brooks.

2118
02:58:23,294 --> 02:58:25,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Schools that, I mean the Roberts or the McGlynn.

2119
02:58:25,356 --> 02:58:28,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Schools that are already having a challenge

2120
02:58:29,131 --> 02:58:30,172
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the last school committee.

2121
02:58:30,192 --> 02:58:42,582
[SPEAKER_23]: We have you know a second grade class at the Roberts that has 24 students in it So that this these are things that are not considered when the zoning board approves things they don't contact the school department and I

2122
02:58:44,518 --> 02:58:51,241
[SPEAKER_23]: We're all have hanging over our head Locust Street, which is 490 units being built on six and a half acres.

2123
02:58:51,582 --> 02:59:02,427
[SPEAKER_23]: If you look at every city that surrounds Medford that is opposing a building project right now, those projects are all on 12, 14, 18 acres of land and slightly over 300.

2124
02:59:02,507 --> 02:59:05,089
[SPEAKER_23]: They were all denied as too dense.

2125
02:59:05,509 --> 02:59:13,213
[SPEAKER_23]: But we approved 490 units on six and a half acres with residents standing up and screaming no.

2126
02:59:14,982 --> 02:59:33,185
[SPEAKER_23]: They just pulled the Salem Street development, which he wants 25 units on 18,000 square feet, which is, I think, 100 feet from the Roberts Elementary School, and he wants to put 27 parking spaces, but he's withdrawing because he's waiting because we all heard about the possibility of 40R.

2127
02:59:33,865 --> 02:59:43,227
[SPEAKER_23]: I just got the schedule for the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting next week, and someone on Main Street wants to tear down, it's either a one or a two-family house, and put up 12 units.

2128
02:59:44,498 --> 02:59:51,083
[SPEAKER_23]: The meeting that I attended in June, they had someone who wanted to tear down a single-family house and put up a seven-family.

2129
02:59:51,584 --> 03:00:01,992
[SPEAKER_23]: So even if you put a moratorium on 25, taking one family and turning it into seven or 10 or 12 is exploding our population.

2130
03:00:03,153 --> 03:00:08,778
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to the Traffic Commission meeting last week, and the people are in saying, you know, I live next door to a two-family house.

2131
03:00:08,838 --> 03:00:10,079
[SPEAKER_23]: They have 15 cars.

2132
03:00:10,479 --> 03:00:11,460
[SPEAKER_23]: They have no parking.

2133
03:00:11,776 --> 03:00:12,637
[SPEAKER_23]: They're all in the street.

2134
03:00:12,797 --> 03:00:14,378
[SPEAKER_23]: I think they're running a rooming house.

2135
03:00:14,718 --> 03:00:27,186
[SPEAKER_23]: So density is being increased constantly, and this is something that we need to consider as we're approving things like turning a one family into a two, turning a one family into a seven, building another unit.

2136
03:00:27,526 --> 03:00:35,572
[SPEAKER_23]: So we really need to stop, because whatever zoning laws are in place, they're not being followed.

2137
03:00:35,632 --> 03:00:39,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Variances are being given out very easily.

2138
03:00:41,829 --> 03:00:43,389
[SPEAKER_23]: save the city, save the schools.

2139
03:00:43,749 --> 03:00:44,110
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2140
03:00:44,390 --> 03:00:44,770
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2141
03:00:46,650 --> 03:00:48,891
[SPEAKER_29]: And the citizen from East Smetford would like to speak.

2142
03:00:49,531 --> 03:00:51,031
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2143
03:00:51,051 --> 03:00:55,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, Councilor, President, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

2144
03:00:56,912 --> 03:01:00,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Smart new growth is a wonderful thing, most of the time.

2145
03:01:01,593 --> 03:01:09,655
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was a kid, before Marada did any of his huge projects, I reiterate, living on Mystic Avenue, of all places,

2146
03:01:10,426 --> 03:01:15,691
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial the old highway to Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960, I believe.

2147
03:01:18,113 --> 03:01:31,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I said many times I would have taken all of Mystic Ave on one side only, by eminent domain, when we had the muscle and it was affordable, even if there was an EPA problem at the junkyard.

2148
03:01:33,167 --> 03:01:34,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have put a ring road next to 93.

2149
03:01:36,295 --> 03:01:43,659
[SPEAKER_09]: and keep them off Main Street, unless they really want to go to deeper squalor in those days, and build 20 stories high.

2150
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:45,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2151
03:01:47,081 --> 03:01:48,981
[SPEAKER_09]: If you worked here, you'd be at work now.

2152
03:01:50,242 --> 03:01:58,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Sloan took my idea 10 years ago on his billboard, 1.5 in the community to the left, on the major highway, of course.

2153
03:02:00,147 --> 03:02:05,650
[SPEAKER_09]: However, that's near the end of the act, because no one would listen to me then, and I'm not even sure about today.

2154
03:02:06,897 --> 03:02:16,923
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would have taken a lot of the property tax heat off mama and papa in those days, if it was done properly.

2155
03:02:17,383 --> 03:02:20,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not being done properly as of today, still.

2156
03:02:20,946 --> 03:02:22,066
[SPEAKER_09]: As we know, Prop 2.5.

2157
03:02:22,206 --> 03:02:26,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank Barbara Anderson, rest her soul.

2158
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:36,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year, you can only raise it 200 percent on your so-called tax levy, which is approximately very close to $100 million this past budget.

2159
03:02:36,907 --> 03:02:40,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 2.5% maximum unless you apply for an override.

2160
03:02:41,708 --> 03:02:44,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 2.5 million on top of the 100 million.

2161
03:02:45,609 --> 03:02:47,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And they never go to 2.5.

2162
03:02:49,050 --> 03:02:57,213
[SPEAKER_09]: They seem to go to 2.49% right on the money, very efficiently close to the max.

2163
03:02:59,013 --> 03:03:04,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So this smart new growth is wonderful, especially the Roman Empire way.

2164
03:03:05,628 --> 03:03:07,089
[SPEAKER_09]: which is like Assembly Road.

2165
03:03:07,650 --> 03:03:11,093
[SPEAKER_09]: If you lived, worked, and played here, you wouldn't even need a bicycle.

2166
03:03:12,254 --> 03:03:13,395
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very smart.

2167
03:03:13,715 --> 03:03:14,456
[SPEAKER_09]: That is smart.

2168
03:03:18,199 --> 03:03:29,690
[SPEAKER_09]: My major point is when you have more children attending schools, it costs money for the schools to fire the police.

2169
03:03:31,771 --> 03:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And the problem is the new growth is hurting the existing real estate taxpayers.

2170
03:03:38,652 --> 03:03:39,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's killing us.

2171
03:03:40,493 --> 03:03:40,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

2172
03:03:41,013 --> 03:03:41,933
[SPEAKER_09]: It's common sense.

2173
03:03:45,274 --> 03:03:57,036
[SPEAKER_09]: If you use the new growth and applied it to that 2.49% increase on a yearly basis, like clockwork for the past many decades I've been around, fine.

2174
03:03:57,416 --> 03:03:58,117
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't.

2175
03:03:59,117 --> 03:04:00,077
[SPEAKER_09]: The city does not.

2176
03:04:02,255 --> 03:04:16,297
[SPEAKER_09]: They take the $100 million and they tax it 2.5% increase, $2.5 million, and they do not deduct that new growth, which was approximately $1.5 to $2 million last year.

2177
03:04:16,718 --> 03:04:23,859
[SPEAKER_09]: If they did that first, then the increase wouldn't be $2.5 million.

2178
03:04:24,139 --> 03:04:26,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be more like $1 million increase.

2179
03:04:27,019 --> 03:04:29,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of my two-family house going up at a rate of 8%,

2180
03:04:31,390 --> 03:04:32,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So what about Prop 2 1⁄2?

2181
03:04:32,571 --> 03:04:33,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, forget about it.

2182
03:04:34,132 --> 03:04:35,153
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to explain it.

2183
03:04:35,874 --> 03:04:36,735
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fallacy.

2184
03:04:38,316 --> 03:04:43,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So my 2 feet under goes up $400 a year in the past 2 years consecutively.

2185
03:04:43,921 --> 03:04:45,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And before that, who knows?

2186
03:04:48,304 --> 03:04:52,628
[SPEAKER_09]: But they don't apply the new growth to the Prop 2 1⁄2 increase.

2187
03:04:54,430 --> 03:04:55,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's a problem.

2188
03:04:56,431 --> 03:04:57,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I rest my case.

2189
03:04:59,352 --> 03:04:59,672
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2190
03:04:59,732 --> 03:05:04,574
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of Vice President Langley-Kern, as amended by Councilors Knight and Scarpelli.

2191
03:05:05,114 --> 03:05:05,974
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

2192
03:05:05,994 --> 03:05:10,696
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry.

2193
03:05:10,976 --> 03:05:24,460
[SPEAKER_29]: Subcommittee on... It's going to... Let's do it on zoning, in ordinance.

2194
03:05:26,881 --> 03:05:27,641
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor?

2195
03:05:28,442 --> 03:05:29,142
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

2196
03:05:30,075 --> 03:05:33,816
[SPEAKER_29]: The ayes have it, motion passes.

2197
03:05:33,836 --> 03:05:35,737
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-667 offered by Councilor Knight.

2198
03:05:36,477 --> 03:05:48,381
[SPEAKER_29]: Whereas, after a decade of consistent decreases in tobacco use by teenagers, the National Youth Tobacco Survey reports that in 2014, overall use of tobacco among youth arose.

2199
03:05:49,029 --> 03:05:50,670
[SPEAKER_29]: exposing dangerous new trends.

2200
03:05:51,371 --> 03:06:02,619
[SPEAKER_29]: And whereas in March of 2015, the Institute of Medicine released a seminal report detailing the potential public health benefits of enacting a nationwide tobacco 21 policy.

2201
03:06:04,945 --> 03:06:24,690
[SPEAKER_29]: concluding a 25% drop in youth smoking initiation, a 12% drop in overall smoking rates, and 16,000 cases of preteen birth and low birth weight averted in the first five years of the policy.

2202
03:06:25,350 --> 03:06:39,420
[SPEAKER_29]: And whereas in July of 2015, the Centers for Disease Control released a study concluding that an astounding 75% of adults favor raising tobacco age to 21, including 70% of current smokers and 65% of those aged 18 to 24.

2203
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:42,062
[SPEAKER_29]: And whereas from January 2009 to December 2015, 402 smokers from Medford

2204
03:06:52,138 --> 03:07:03,046
[SPEAKER_29]: were referred to smoking cessation programs through Massachusetts Smoking Helpline, yet only 140 of these individuals completed an intake to quit smoking.

2205
03:07:03,847 --> 03:07:18,058
[SPEAKER_29]: Be it so ordered, the legal age for the retail purchase of tobacco products in the City of Medford be raised to the age of 21 years by striking Municipal Ordinance 58-45B1 and replacing it with the following language.

2206
03:07:21,909 --> 03:07:23,310
[SPEAKER_29]: Conditions of permits.

2207
03:07:23,950 --> 03:07:26,032
[SPEAKER_29]: Conditions of permits are as follows.

2208
03:07:26,632 --> 03:07:50,608
[SPEAKER_29]: One, no entity may sell any tobacco products in any of its forms to any person under the age of 21 years or not being his parent or guardian may give any tobacco products in any of its form to any person under the age of 21 years unless said person is 18 years of age and in possession

2209
03:07:51,109 --> 03:07:53,570
[SPEAKER_29]: of a valid military identification card.

2210
03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:56,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

2211
03:07:56,990 --> 03:07:58,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2212
03:07:58,390 --> 03:08:00,351
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate you reading through that.

2213
03:08:00,391 --> 03:08:02,571
[SPEAKER_22]: It was rather long, but thank you very much.

2214
03:08:03,051 --> 03:08:05,232
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this ordinance change speaks for itself.

2215
03:08:05,532 --> 03:08:20,635
[SPEAKER_22]: The intention of this ordinance change would be to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products in the city of Medford from 18 to 21 years of age, unless that individual is 18 years of age and in possession of a valid military identification card, a member of our armed services, Mr. President.

2216
03:08:21,957 --> 03:08:28,979
[SPEAKER_22]: 130 of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have adopted a measure raising the legal age to purchase tobacco from 18 to 21.

2217
03:08:30,019 --> 03:08:36,180
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the equivalent to about 37 percent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2218
03:08:36,260 --> 03:08:42,742
[SPEAKER_22]: 180 municipalities across the United States of America have adopted a measure raising the age to purchase tobacco products to 21.

2219
03:08:44,205 --> 03:08:56,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Massachusetts is obviously a leader with 130 of those communities laying here in our great state, but there are 50 other communities as of August 1st that have adopted this, including New York City, Kansas City, Cleveland, and even Boston, Mr. President.

2220
03:08:57,056 --> 03:09:05,122
[SPEAKER_22]: Two states in the union have also adopted a measure making it a statewide requirement that the legal age to purchase tobacco products would be raised from 18 to 21.

2221
03:09:05,482 --> 03:09:08,284
[SPEAKER_22]: Those two states are California and Hawaii, Mr. President.

2222
03:09:08,344 --> 03:09:11,307
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the largest states in our union, California, has taken this measure.

2223
03:09:11,867 --> 03:09:12,888
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a public safety issue.

2224
03:09:14,263 --> 03:09:34,515
[SPEAKER_22]: In 1986, in Philip Morris' annual report, Mr. President, you could read the report, and it would indicate that raising the legal minimum age for cigarette purchase to 21 could gut our key young adult market from age 17 to 20, where we sell about 25 billion cigarettes annually and enjoy a 70% market share.

2225
03:09:35,596 --> 03:09:43,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, data will also say that 90% of all smokers started smoking before the age of 21, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

2226
03:09:43,717 --> 03:09:44,698
[SPEAKER_22]: released in 2011.

2227
03:09:45,718 --> 03:09:53,343
[SPEAKER_22]: And 99 percent of all smokers started smoking before age 26, according to the Surgeon General report of 2012, Mr. President.

2228
03:09:54,163 --> 03:09:59,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm putting this measure forward as an ordinance change in the interest of public safety, and I'd ask my colleagues to support it here at the City Council.

2229
03:10:01,267 --> 03:10:02,908
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

2230
03:10:03,208 --> 03:10:03,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2231
03:10:04,489 --> 03:10:06,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, nobody supports this more than me.

2232
03:10:06,671 --> 03:10:10,933
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother passed away from smoking, and I don't think you should.

2233
03:10:11,514 --> 03:10:15,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Nate, are you including the vaping products in this too?

2234
03:10:16,137 --> 03:10:16,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Say that again?

2235
03:10:16,677 --> 03:10:19,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you including the vaping products?

2236
03:10:19,059 --> 03:10:23,262
[SPEAKER_22]: At this point in time, Councilor Caraviello, I believe the vaping products have been addressed by way of a regulation.

2237
03:10:23,902 --> 03:10:28,905
[SPEAKER_22]: The Board of Health issued a vaping product regulation, and I believe that that regulation speaks to the vaping products.

2238
03:10:29,085 --> 03:10:30,606
[SPEAKER_22]: City ordinance does not at this point in time.

2239
03:10:32,668 --> 03:10:32,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2240
03:10:32,968 --> 03:10:36,850
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I say that I'm in full support of this.

2241
03:10:37,851 --> 03:10:39,252
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, Mr. President, I'd like to add that

2242
03:10:40,102 --> 03:10:45,866
[SPEAKER_22]: of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 communities in the Mystic Valley area that is part of the task force.

2243
03:10:46,486 --> 03:10:49,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford is one of the remaining communities that has not adopted this measure.

2244
03:10:49,768 --> 03:10:59,435
[SPEAKER_22]: So while surrounding communities have adopted this measure, we're actually the weak link in the chain at this point in time, where individuals in other communities that have a legal age of 21 can come to Medford and purchase the cigarettes.

2245
03:11:00,335 --> 03:11:06,459
[SPEAKER_22]: So in an effort to work with our colleagues and our counterparts in the communities beside us, I think that this is a great initiative.

2246
03:11:07,840 --> 03:11:09,161
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

2247
03:11:09,432 --> 03:11:10,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2248
03:11:10,212 --> 03:11:13,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward tonight.

2249
03:11:14,754 --> 03:11:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, I support wholeheartedly.

2250
03:11:17,495 --> 03:11:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes complete sense.

2251
03:11:19,275 --> 03:11:20,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking is so dangerous.

2252
03:11:20,696 --> 03:11:29,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing when, back in my years in the school committee, we would get yearly reports about, you know, tobacco trends and alcohol trends and drug trends and whatnot.

2253
03:11:29,859 --> 03:11:36,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's so hard to believe, even knowing the dangers of cigarettes, that, you know, young people would still smoke.

2254
03:11:37,595 --> 03:11:39,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But I support this 100%.

2255
03:11:39,116 --> 03:11:41,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you for a council night for bringing it forward.

2256
03:11:41,758 --> 03:11:45,861
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great resolution and I'm happy he brought it forward.

2257
03:11:45,881 --> 03:11:46,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

2258
03:11:46,421 --> 03:11:48,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, if I may.

2259
03:11:49,783 --> 03:11:59,690
[SPEAKER_22]: In terms of the military exemption that's included in the language here, that was something that I put in there based on feedback from individual constituents that I had spoken about that had served in the armed forces and that spoke a little bit about

2260
03:12:00,445 --> 03:12:09,897
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, how they started smoking at a young age in the military and how they felt as though if they were of the legal age to vote and fight that they should be old enough to make a decision to purchase cigarettes.

2261
03:12:10,658 --> 03:12:13,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Since that time and since some of my discussions with Ms.

2262
03:12:13,121 --> 03:12:16,605
[SPEAKER_22]: Busby from the task force over in the city of Melrose who helps us here in Medford,

2263
03:12:17,182 --> 03:12:25,469
[SPEAKER_22]: She's provided me with a number of articles and a number of documents saying that the military actually is looking to curb tobacco use among military members.

2264
03:12:25,509 --> 03:12:43,765
[SPEAKER_22]: They've put out a number of reports saying that those soldiers that actually smoke on a daily basis, it's having an effect on their military readiness and it's also obviously, Mr. President, having an effect on their longevity in the community after their obligations to the service of enlistment are over.

2265
03:12:45,602 --> 03:12:53,084
[SPEAKER_22]: With that being said, I have no problem with the language in there as it is, but if individuals have a problem with that particular portion of the language, I have no problem striking it.

2266
03:12:53,624 --> 03:13:04,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I think ultimately it's a public safety bill, and what we want to do here is be sure that the youth in the city of Medford aren't exposed to tobacco products at a young age so that we have a better opportunity of keeping them out of the nicotine habit.

2267
03:13:05,408 --> 03:13:15,371
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I personally don't have any problem striking that language, and it's really a matter that I'd rely on my council colleagues to provide further input.

2268
03:13:15,804 --> 03:13:22,805
[SPEAKER_22]: I have had some preliminary conversations with the administration, and Mayor Burke said that that was an exemption that she was certainly opposed to.

2269
03:13:23,585 --> 03:13:32,507
[SPEAKER_22]: She feels as though it provides an enforcement issue, and she feels as though it's kind of counterintuitive to the actual context of the resolution.

2270
03:13:32,607 --> 03:13:34,908
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I have no problem striking it.

2271
03:13:35,228 --> 03:13:39,008
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel as though it might be an item that comes down to being vetoed anyway.

2272
03:13:39,088 --> 03:13:42,949
[SPEAKER_22]: So at this point in time, Mr. President, I think it might be in our best interest to strike the military exemption.

2273
03:13:43,442 --> 03:13:54,610
[SPEAKER_22]: send it over to the president to get passed, send it over to the administration to get passed if that's the wishes of the council, and then if we get some feedback from individuals that are over 18 years of age that are active and in the military, we can take another look at the ordinance.

2274
03:13:54,690 --> 03:14:04,878
[SPEAKER_22]: But the intent and purpose is a public health ordinance, and I think that putting that exemption in there based upon the materials that were submitted to me from the task force would prove to be counterintuitive and counterproductive, Mr. President.

2275
03:14:06,439 --> 03:14:07,199
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor.

2276
03:14:07,419 --> 03:14:08,860
[SPEAKER_29]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

2277
03:14:09,501 --> 03:14:10,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2278
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:12,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Knight read my mind.

2279
03:14:12,821 --> 03:14:16,244
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one issue I had with this particular resolution.

2280
03:14:16,284 --> 03:14:19,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you're willing to strike that, I could support it.

2281
03:14:19,708 --> 03:14:27,775
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that to run for the House of Representatives, the U.S.

2282
03:14:27,795 --> 03:14:30,057
[SPEAKER_07]: House of Representatives, you have to be 25 years old.

2283
03:14:30,558 --> 03:14:31,439
[SPEAKER_07]: To run for the U.S.

2284
03:14:31,479 --> 03:14:33,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Senate, you have to be 30 years old.

2285
03:14:34,582 --> 03:14:35,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's amazing.

2286
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:36,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You can vote at 21.

2287
03:14:37,554 --> 03:14:42,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't run for office until you're 25 and until you're 30 on that level.

2288
03:14:42,296 --> 03:14:54,300
[SPEAKER_07]: But getting back to this, I support this whole hotly with the removal of the military identification card and the veterans exemption.

2289
03:14:56,581 --> 03:15:00,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I'd move to amend the paper by striking the following language.

2290
03:15:02,963 --> 03:15:07,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless said person is 18 years of age and in possession of a valid military identification card.

2291
03:15:07,513 --> 03:15:12,316
[SPEAKER_29]: So it will lend to any person under the age of 21 years period.

2292
03:15:12,716 --> 03:15:13,077
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, sir.

2293
03:15:14,338 --> 03:15:14,738
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2294
03:15:15,798 --> 03:15:18,440
[SPEAKER_29]: So person at the podium wishes to address the council.

2295
03:15:19,061 --> 03:15:19,461
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

2296
03:15:19,501 --> 03:15:21,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2297
03:15:21,903 --> 03:15:22,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

2298
03:15:22,643 --> 03:15:23,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2299
03:15:23,043 --> 03:15:24,384
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Maureen Busby.

2300
03:15:24,424 --> 03:15:28,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I live in Melrose, Massachusetts, and I happen to be your tobacco program coordinator.

2301
03:15:29,390 --> 03:15:32,971
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank Councilor Wright for this resolution.

2302
03:15:34,071 --> 03:15:36,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I obviously support it wholeheartedly.

2303
03:15:36,251 --> 03:15:42,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I was very glad to hear all of the support and especially the support for the military exemption.

2304
03:15:43,392 --> 03:15:57,555
[SPEAKER_14]: While I too, you know, I have passion for the fact that, or I should say sympathy for the fact that, and I hear it all the time in all the communities that I've worked in who have already raised the legal age to 21, that we send our young people to war

2305
03:15:58,098 --> 03:16:00,380
[SPEAKER_14]: at age 18, but they can't buy a pack of cigarettes.

2306
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:09,768
[SPEAKER_14]: And thankfully, Councilor Wright has done his research and found out that the military is working very, very hard to eliminate smoking in the military.

2307
03:16:09,888 --> 03:16:11,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And I actually came prepared.

2308
03:16:11,649 --> 03:16:17,975
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can leave these for you, but with some packets of articles that address this situation.

2309
03:16:17,995 --> 03:16:25,001
[SPEAKER_29]: The city messenger will take them from you and distribute them to other houses.

2310
03:16:25,021 --> 03:16:26,242
[SPEAKER_29]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2311
03:16:26,711 --> 03:16:29,213
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to take credit where credit isn't due.

2312
03:16:29,834 --> 03:16:29,974
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

2313
03:16:30,014 --> 03:16:30,995
[SPEAKER_22]: Busby did all the research.

2314
03:16:31,535 --> 03:16:34,878
[SPEAKER_22]: I just read what she sent me in terms of the military exemption.

2315
03:16:34,918 --> 03:16:35,499
[SPEAKER_14]: But you read it.

2316
03:16:35,519 --> 03:16:36,220
[SPEAKER_22]: I did.

2317
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:37,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your help.

2318
03:16:37,180 --> 03:16:38,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

2319
03:16:38,301 --> 03:16:39,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

2320
03:16:40,063 --> 03:16:50,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to point out that that military exemption isn't in any of the other 135 communities in Massachusetts that have already raised the legal age to 31.

2321
03:16:50,772 --> 03:16:53,355
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, I had other remarks.

2322
03:16:54,791 --> 03:16:59,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Among Councilor Wright and the other Councilors, you already covered everything else that I would have said this evening.

2323
03:17:00,057 --> 03:17:01,819
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, thank you very much.

2324
03:17:02,379 --> 03:17:02,780
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2325
03:17:03,641 --> 03:17:07,385
[SPEAKER_29]: So we have the Madam Director.

2326
03:17:09,427 --> 03:17:10,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening again.

2327
03:17:10,288 --> 03:17:11,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank you.

2328
03:17:12,868 --> 03:17:30,178
[SPEAKER_13]: let you know that I had my first Board of Health meeting today with the city of Medford, and Board of Health is very happy that you're moving forward with this resolution, and also now very happy that you're striking the military exemption, because that was one thing the board wanted me to convey, that they really wish would happen.

2329
03:17:30,218 --> 03:17:32,079
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for moving this forward.

2330
03:17:32,119 --> 03:17:36,042
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a huge public health issue, and I appreciate and applaud you.

2331
03:17:36,362 --> 03:17:36,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2332
03:17:40,910 --> 03:17:49,533
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, we will commence our first reading by a roll call vote.

2333
03:17:51,654 --> 03:17:52,274
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Marks.

2334
03:17:52,954 --> 03:17:56,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Mrs. Busby, is it Busby?

2335
03:17:58,116 --> 03:17:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Busby.

2336
03:17:58,956 --> 03:18:09,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you participate when they do the stings within the community for convenience stores that are selling to minors?

2337
03:18:09,079 --> 03:18:09,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2338
03:18:09,840 --> 03:18:10,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you participate with that?

2339
03:18:12,524 --> 03:18:13,964
[SPEAKER_14]: You mean do the compliance checks?

2340
03:18:14,304 --> 03:18:21,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I take a trained youth to all retail stores in Medford that have a tobacco permit at least twice a year.

2341
03:18:22,546 --> 03:18:26,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you just briefly give us an update on how we compare to other communities?

2342
03:18:26,967 --> 03:18:29,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Are our businesses selling in general to minors?

2343
03:18:30,908 --> 03:18:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Will this help raising the age even though they may be selling to minors no matter what?

2344
03:18:36,429 --> 03:18:38,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so a couple of clarifications.

2345
03:18:40,068 --> 03:18:52,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford stores are probably, I have seven communities that I do directly, and Medford stores are probably, compliance-wise, in the bottom half of the seven stores.

2346
03:18:52,273 --> 03:18:56,195
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could use some improvement in compliance.

2347
03:18:56,715 --> 03:19:05,079
[SPEAKER_14]: However, this particular region, the Mystic Valley region that I work, has much higher compliance than most of the other regions in the state.

2348
03:19:05,499 --> 03:19:07,580
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do very, very well in this region,

2349
03:19:08,401 --> 03:19:10,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford could use a little improvement.

2350
03:19:11,042 --> 03:19:17,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, currently, I use a 16 or a 17-year-old youth to do what we call under age 18 checks.

2351
03:19:18,405 --> 03:19:28,089
[SPEAKER_14]: In my other communities where they've raised the minimum legal sales age to 21, I do a third check in addition to the two state-required checks.

2352
03:19:28,489 --> 03:19:31,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I do a third check, and I use a 19 or 20-year-old, and I call that the age 21 check.

2353
03:19:35,752 --> 03:19:45,375
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason that I do it is because I've noticed in my other communities that when I use a 16 or 17-year-old, I seldom get a sale, which is a good thing.

2354
03:19:46,216 --> 03:19:52,218
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I use a 19 or 20-year-old, I'm more apt to get sales, or, you know, the youth is more apt to get a sale.

2355
03:19:52,738 --> 03:20:00,641
[SPEAKER_14]: So the hope that I would have in Medford would be if you pass this resolution,

2356
03:20:01,149 --> 03:20:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: that also money would be provided to do compliance checks using a 19 or 20 year old because the state only provides funding for me to do compliance checks for the under age 18, meaning I use a 16 or 17 year old.

2357
03:20:16,076 --> 03:20:30,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's really important when you do, if you pass this resolution, to do an additional check with a 19 or 20 year old so that you're closer to that legal age, that minimum legal age, and you're getting a truer compliance check.

2358
03:20:30,610 --> 03:20:36,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if you're using 16 years old with a 21 minimum age, you have a five years difference.

2359
03:20:37,336 --> 03:20:38,257
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's important.

2360
03:20:38,597 --> 03:20:53,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I would estimate that it would be around $300 in expenses, my time, youth time, and the purchases, if the city were to fund an additional compliance check out of its own pocket.

2361
03:20:54,307 --> 03:20:56,169
[SPEAKER_07]: if you did this resolution.

2362
03:20:56,429 --> 03:21:03,715
[SPEAKER_07]: The violations that are handed out, are they state violations or local ordinances?

2363
03:21:04,996 --> 03:21:06,237
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit of a hybrid.

2364
03:21:06,457 --> 03:21:17,886
[SPEAKER_14]: The state has a legal age of 18, and so there are state regulations around the selling of tobacco, where the tobacco products have to be placed behind the counter.

2365
03:21:17,906 --> 03:21:19,267
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some state regulations.

2366
03:21:19,688 --> 03:21:22,650
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to that, the city of Medford has some regulations

2367
03:21:23,678 --> 03:21:33,443
[SPEAKER_14]: a pharmacy ban for instance, but the legal age would be, for the 18, the under age 18 sale, is a state regulation.

2368
03:21:33,804 --> 03:21:42,988
[SPEAKER_14]: But the city of Medford authorizes me to do compliance checks, and I write a city of Medford ticket for the violation.

2369
03:21:43,589 --> 03:21:45,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much is that for the first offense?

2370
03:21:45,490 --> 03:21:51,873
[SPEAKER_14]: $100 for the first violation, $200 for the second violation with a seven day suspension of the tobacco permit,

2371
03:21:52,578 --> 03:22:00,343
[SPEAKER_14]: and a $300 fine for the third, oh wait, I think in Medford you don't do, I'm sorry, in Medford you don't do, I'm sorry, you don't do suspensions.

2372
03:22:00,363 --> 03:22:01,483
[SPEAKER_14]: $100 fine, $200 fine, $300 fine.

2373
03:22:01,643 --> 03:22:05,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And who issues the tobacco permit, the Board of Health, our Board of Health?

2374
03:22:05,786 --> 03:22:06,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Board of Health, yep.

2375
03:22:07,527 --> 03:22:12,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't, it's not built into the ordinance that we could do a suspension of the license, the tobacco license?

2376
03:22:13,770 --> 03:22:15,391
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, okay, I'm sorry.

2377
03:22:15,411 --> 03:22:20,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I have seven communities and I didn't, I didn't check this before I came, which I should have.

2378
03:22:23,056 --> 03:22:29,278
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a seven-day suspension, and a 14-day suspension, and then a 30-day suspension for the third offense.

2379
03:22:29,298 --> 03:22:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2380
03:22:30,219 --> 03:22:34,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the fourth offense, you can issue a license revoke.

2381
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:35,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2382
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:37,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So, would we issue a ticket?

2383
03:22:39,241 --> 03:22:41,522
[SPEAKER_07]: That revenue goes back to the city office.

2384
03:22:41,682 --> 03:22:42,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2385
03:22:43,083 --> 03:22:50,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you have any reporting on the number of tickets issued and the number of violations per business?

2386
03:22:51,300 --> 03:22:52,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't bring it with me.

2387
03:22:52,260 --> 03:22:54,602
[SPEAKER_14]: We can produce that.

2388
03:22:54,642 --> 03:22:56,062

03:23:06,928 --> 03:23:14,872

2395
03:23:14,992 --> 03:23:17,613
[SPEAKER_22]: And they can because the other inspections are.

2491
03:31:38,406 --> 03:31:39,026
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

2492
03:31:39,166 --> 03:31:48,793
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, Mr. President, as we noted earlier in the meeting, uh, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances made up of myself along with Councilor Falco and Councilor carrot yellow.

2493
03:31:50,274 --> 03:31:52,255
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, we've met on a number of times.

2494
03:31:52,495 --> 03:31:54,397
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, we've met at a number of meetings, Mr. President.

2495
03:31:54,497 --> 03:31:54,657
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh,

2496
03:31:56,973 --> 03:32:05,456
[SPEAKER_22]: 512, 523, 81912, to take a look at the proposed safe zoning, the zoning amendment for the safe access to medicinal marijuana, Mr. President.

2497
03:32:05,877 --> 03:32:10,559
[SPEAKER_22]: And we made a series of recommendations for this committee of the whole to further entertain.

2498
03:32:11,199 --> 03:32:18,062
[SPEAKER_22]: The motion that came out of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances was that the committee of the whole would further entertain this for further deliberation and discussion.

2499
03:32:18,840 --> 03:32:43,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, recommendations include, uh, vesting the special permit granting authority with the board of health, um, expanding the maximum allowable gross square footage of a facility to prevent lines from building outside, increasing the permitting fee and using the, uh, portion of the permitting fee for the programming and related materials to meet the mission of the substance abuse and outreach coordinator, um, requiring the filing of the floor plan with the city clerk, um,

2500
03:32:44,217 --> 03:32:51,340
[SPEAKER_22]: We examined the inclusion of C1 and C2 districts, Mr. President, but would recommend that we only allow it in industrially zoned areas.

2501
03:32:52,160 --> 03:33:00,163
[SPEAKER_22]: We looked at developing an overlay district versus a zoning amendment, and we figured that the zoning amendment was the way to go as opposed to establishing an overlay district.

2502
03:33:00,984 --> 03:33:09,567
[SPEAKER_22]: We discussed limiting the number of licenses for sale here in the community with the recreational bill coming on the ballot in November.

2503
03:33:10,251 --> 03:33:16,253
[SPEAKER_22]: There might be some issue with limiting the number of licenses issued for medicinal or other uses here in the community.

2504
03:33:17,453 --> 03:33:24,936
[SPEAKER_22]: We examined buffer zone provisions, residential buffer zone provisions from locating a facility near a residentially zoned district.

2505
03:33:26,376 --> 03:33:33,379
[SPEAKER_22]: We discussed banning or regulating marijuana-infused products, regulating the potency in packaging versus an outright ban.

2506
03:33:34,919 --> 03:33:37,420
[SPEAKER_22]: We also discussed allowing the

2507
03:33:38,138 --> 03:33:50,724
[SPEAKER_22]: administration as the contract negotiating authority here in the community to have the sole authority to sign a letter of non-opposition for a marijuana dispensary for medicinal purposes to come into our community.

2508
03:33:51,624 --> 03:33:56,386
[SPEAKER_22]: We made a recommendation of limiting the hours and days of operation from Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.

2509
03:33:56,406 --> 03:33:58,487
[SPEAKER_22]: to 6 p.m., not often on the weekends.

2510
03:34:00,680 --> 03:34:08,003
[SPEAKER_22]: We also recommend that we enable the Board of Health to be empowered to establish rules and regulations to implement the ordinance that's before us.

2511
03:34:08,803 --> 03:34:26,770
[SPEAKER_22]: And most importantly, that we'd hold a public information and input session out in the community so that we could receive some feedback from the residents that reside in this community as to what their thoughts and feelings are based upon the proposal that was put before us and the recommended changes that the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinance has made and what recommendations the Committee as a whole will make thereafter.

2512
03:34:27,470 --> 03:34:30,111
[SPEAKER_29]: So your recommendation is that this be sent to the Committee of the Whole?

2513
03:34:30,131 --> 03:34:30,711
[SPEAKER_29]: That is correct, sir.

2514
03:34:31,031 --> 03:34:33,512
[SPEAKER_29]: So on that recommendation, all those in favor?

2515
03:34:34,092 --> 03:34:34,792
[SPEAKER_29]: All those opposed?

2516
03:34:34,872 --> 03:34:35,552
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion carries.

2517
03:34:35,993 --> 03:34:45,836
[SPEAKER_29]: And then 1678, Subcommittee on Licensing has done a ton of work as well, chaired by Councilor Caraviello with Councilors Knight and Falco.

2518
03:34:47,816 --> 03:34:57,059
[SPEAKER_29]: We had some work on licensing of mobile food trucks and also a revision for ordinances on cars

2519
03:34:57,617 --> 03:34:59,698
[SPEAKER_29]: for higher Hackney carriages.

2520
03:35:01,978 --> 03:35:02,819
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Caraviello.

2521
03:35:03,659 --> 03:35:04,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2522
03:35:04,639 --> 03:35:17,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, we sided with the food trucks, with the pilot program that was recommended by the mayor, and it was the agreement that we adopt that ordinance

2523
03:35:18,538 --> 03:35:27,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We suggested that we use possibly the city of Boston's permitting process, which is probably one of the most stringent in the areas.

2524
03:35:29,182 --> 03:35:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We did allow some food trucks to come in for, I think, a few events up until, I think, sometime in October, November.

2525
03:35:40,927 --> 03:35:43,748
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, all food trucks coming into the city

2526
03:35:44,371 --> 03:35:52,454
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to adhere to the same ordinances and regulations that any brick and mortar restaurant has to adhere to also, Mr. President.

2527
03:35:52,794 --> 03:36:04,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did say that it would be a one-year pilot program from the date of implementation.

2528
03:36:06,219 --> 03:36:10,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll say at this point, it's been recommended for approval.

2529
03:36:11,541 --> 03:36:13,202
[SPEAKER_29]: So recommended for approval.

2530
03:36:13,811 --> 03:36:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Or for discussion in the Committee of the Whole.

2531
03:36:15,673 --> 03:36:16,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussion, excuse me, I'm sorry.

2532
03:36:16,754 --> 03:36:17,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussion of the Committee of the Whole.

2533
03:36:18,155 --> 03:36:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

2534
03:36:18,676 --> 03:36:20,017
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as the taxi cab.

2535
03:36:20,037 --> 03:36:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: The taxi cabs, we did a lot of work on that also.

2536
03:36:23,060 --> 03:36:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been some issues that we've changed.

2537
03:36:28,926 --> 03:36:38,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to be recommended to the Committee of the Whole also with the intent on turning it over to the Chief of Police for him to take the program over.

2538
03:36:38,965 --> 03:36:42,526
[SPEAKER_29]: Very good, so on the motion to send this to Committee of the Whole, all those in favor?

2539
03:36:42,546 --> 03:36:43,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

2540
03:36:44,066 --> 03:36:48,588
[SPEAKER_29]: Very good, leave your Tuesday and Wednesday nights open in the coming months.

2541
03:36:51,669 --> 03:36:55,490
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Citizen, you wanted to speak on a matter.

2542
03:36:56,030 --> 03:37:02,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, if I may, I didn't want to interrupt your moment of silence from my old neighbor, Jack McGlynn, Sr.

2543
03:37:03,012 --> 03:37:07,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be amiss not to say, read this short three paragraphs,

2544
03:37:08,249 --> 03:37:08,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

2545
03:37:08,549 --> 03:37:09,769
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, please, thank you.

2546
03:37:12,350 --> 03:37:18,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to say some kind words about my old neighbor, Mr. John Jake, Jack Sr.

2547
03:37:18,672 --> 03:37:19,072
[SPEAKER_09]: McGlynn.

2548
03:37:19,612 --> 03:37:29,095
[SPEAKER_09]: But first off, if I may, I'd like to commend you, Councilor President Dello Russo, for doing an outstanding job on Jack's stately funeral.

2549
03:37:30,115 --> 03:37:31,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. McGlynn Sr.

2550
03:37:31,735 --> 03:37:33,636
[SPEAKER_09]: may have been the consummate politician

2551
03:37:34,480 --> 03:37:47,448
[SPEAKER_09]: But more importantly, he was and still is, as he is reunited with his wonderful wife, Helen Lennox, the consummate gentleman, a kind and gentle man all the time.

2552
03:37:47,929 --> 03:37:54,753
[SPEAKER_09]: May God bless him and all of us to emulate his character while we are still here on Earth.

2553
03:37:55,954 --> 03:38:00,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'd like to share a little known fact about Jack Sr.

2554
03:38:02,922 --> 03:38:13,710
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1980, I knocked on his door to introduce myself as his new neighbor, and he surprised me by speaking in a fluent Southern Italian dialect.

2555
03:38:15,091 --> 03:38:23,296
[SPEAKER_09]: This blew my mind, but later on I surmised he must have learned it as a child, as I did, my Northern Italian dialect.

2556
03:38:24,497 --> 03:38:31,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he learned it from the Perica or the Catino, but I believe it's the Perica side of the family.

2557
03:38:32,688 --> 03:38:35,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I know he also spoke Latin.

2558
03:38:36,791 --> 03:38:41,715
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots more good stories from the past 36 years, but I'll keep it very brief.

2559
03:38:43,556 --> 03:38:45,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll just say one more.

2560
03:38:46,278 --> 03:38:49,601
[SPEAKER_09]: About 20 years ago, my son knocked on his door for Halloween.

2561
03:38:50,521 --> 03:38:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack come running down the stairs from the second floor.

2562
03:38:55,605 --> 03:39:00,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Put some candy in his bag, I guess, and then when he came back down, my son,

2563
03:39:00,937 --> 03:39:02,637
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, Andrew, is that your boy?

2564
03:39:02,717 --> 03:39:03,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, yes.

2565
03:39:04,758 --> 03:39:05,858
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, send him back.

2566
03:39:05,898 --> 03:39:09,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, he started to deposit some more treats in his bag.

2567
03:39:09,619 --> 03:39:11,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like US currency.

2568
03:39:14,820 --> 03:39:15,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet guy.

2569
03:39:15,980 --> 03:39:22,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Furthermore, can you imagine how many wakes the man attended to?

2570
03:39:24,262 --> 03:39:25,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Including both my parents.

2571
03:39:26,463 --> 03:39:27,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't have to do these things.

2572
03:39:29,045 --> 03:39:32,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The man was and will always be a class act.

2573
03:39:33,128 --> 03:39:36,210
[SPEAKER_09]: He truly is one of the greats of the greatest generation.

2574
03:39:36,991 --> 03:39:39,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack will be sorely missed, but not forgotten.

2575
03:39:40,153 --> 03:39:41,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening.

2576
03:39:45,717 --> 03:39:48,979
[SPEAKER_29]: Presentations and similar matters.

2577
03:39:48,999 --> 03:39:56,124
[SPEAKER_29]: 16-672 petitioned by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street in Metrod, Mass., to address the council about a monument in honor of first responders.

2578
03:39:57,016 --> 03:39:57,876
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome, Ms.

2579
03:39:57,896 --> 03:39:58,236
[SPEAKER_29]: Martin.

2580
03:39:58,476 --> 03:39:58,836
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2581
03:39:58,856 --> 03:40:00,177
[SPEAKER_29]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2582
03:40:00,397 --> 03:40:03,118
[SPEAKER_32]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and you saved the best for last.

2583
03:40:05,198 --> 03:40:16,581
[SPEAKER_32]: Our emergency workers are so much more to us today than they were prior to September 11, 2001, and we as a city need to recognize them as the exceptional people they are.

2584
03:40:18,181 --> 03:40:23,563
[SPEAKER_32]: Their sacrifice has not been recognized by the city in deed or material.

2585
03:40:24,063 --> 03:40:24,983
[SPEAKER_32]: This needs to change.

2586
03:40:25,862 --> 03:40:35,127
[SPEAKER_32]: Starting with September 11, 2001, 411 emergency workers were killed trying to save the lives of those in the Trade Center.

2587
03:40:35,888 --> 03:40:41,191
[SPEAKER_32]: This included 343 firefighters, of whom two were paramedics.

2588
03:40:42,291 --> 03:40:45,493
[SPEAKER_32]: Of those who were killed, seven firefighters were black men.

2589
03:40:46,093 --> 03:40:49,015
[SPEAKER_32]: And yes, this needs to be pointed out, race matters.

2590
03:40:50,096 --> 03:40:54,318
[SPEAKER_32]: Thirty-seven police officers of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

2591
03:40:55,637 --> 03:41:03,723
[SPEAKER_32]: 23 police officers of the New York Police Department, and eight emergency medical technicians in private emergency medical services.

2592
03:41:04,564 --> 03:41:10,268
[SPEAKER_32]: Of all police officers killed on September 11, 2001, 11 were women.

2593
03:41:10,908 --> 03:41:13,850
[SPEAKER_32]: And of those women, four women were of color.

2594
03:41:15,111 --> 03:41:16,773
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, this needs to be pointed out.

2595
03:41:17,293 --> 03:41:18,494
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, gender matters.

2596
03:41:19,555 --> 03:41:22,817
[SPEAKER_32]: Also of note, 12 police officers were men of color.

2597
03:41:24,118 --> 03:41:37,841
[SPEAKER_32]: The National Guard, whose job it once was to defend the homeland, are now being deployed to the current wars in Iraq and Syria through Operation Inherent Resolve, and in Afghanistan through Operation Freedom Sentinel.

2598
03:41:38,842 --> 03:41:48,504
[SPEAKER_32]: Using the National Guard more as the reserves in regular army has forced our police departments to become literally the front line of our national defense.

2599
03:41:49,964 --> 03:41:52,545
[SPEAKER_32]: They have been used to stop terrorists in their tracks

2600
03:41:53,045 --> 03:42:06,776
[SPEAKER_32]: whether it be Little Rock, Arkansas in June 2009 at a recruiting station where one soldier was killed and another wounded, or whether it was Fort Hood where 13 soldiers were killed and 31 others were wounded.

2601
03:42:07,497 --> 03:42:12,961
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, the cop who stopped the rampage was a female and took a bullet to her hand from the shooter.

2602
03:42:14,863 --> 03:42:18,546
[SPEAKER_32]: Or April 15, 2013, a day Boston will never forget.

2603
03:42:19,897 --> 03:42:28,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Or whether it be July 16, 2015, in San Bernardino, where 14 people were killed.

2604
03:42:29,625 --> 03:42:35,670
[SPEAKER_32]: Or Orlando, on June 12, 2016, where 49 were killed and 53 were wounded.

2605
03:42:37,531 --> 03:42:42,695
[SPEAKER_32]: Or this weekend, in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, where 29 people were injured.

2606
03:42:43,776 --> 03:42:46,939
[SPEAKER_32]: The first called to the scene are our police personnel.

2607
03:42:47,788 --> 03:42:50,009
[SPEAKER_32]: and they literally put their lives on the line for us.

2608
03:42:50,810 --> 03:42:54,592
[SPEAKER_32]: And we need to recognize them for their new role and appreciate them for it.

2609
03:42:55,993 --> 03:43:04,859
[SPEAKER_32]: The fire department has played the first responder role as the medical team, very much the way the Army medic traditionally has during a battle.

2610
03:43:06,180 --> 03:43:08,101
[SPEAKER_32]: They are the triage unit.

2611
03:43:08,921 --> 03:43:12,804
[SPEAKER_32]: They are saving lives by being on the front line during an active mass event.

2612
03:43:13,604 --> 03:43:16,346
[SPEAKER_32]: I would also include EMS workers with these two groups.

2613
03:43:17,890 --> 03:43:23,293
[SPEAKER_32]: They are under-respected for their service and sacrifice by this city in policy and material.

2614
03:43:24,514 --> 03:43:29,356
[SPEAKER_32]: While there are many ways to thank you, one is with a statue or a monument.

2615
03:43:31,628 --> 03:43:38,954
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm gonna suggest the statue of my dreams, but I know we don't have the money for it, but I'm gonna, then I'll tell you what I really want.

2616
03:43:39,614 --> 03:43:44,438
[SPEAKER_32]: But if I had my druthers, I would, that's right, that's right.

2617
03:43:45,178 --> 03:43:59,009
[SPEAKER_32]: If I could, and indulge me in this, I would knock down the dance hall outside, I'd pay for it and knock it down, put a green grass area up there, and I would have life-size monuments of a police officer,

2618
03:43:59,428 --> 03:44:07,871
[SPEAKER_32]: saluting a flag with a flagpole standing nearby, and a firefighter doing the firefighter's carry of a civilian.

2619
03:44:08,272 --> 03:44:09,392
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that would be cool.

2620
03:44:09,472 --> 03:44:16,675
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would put a park bench near there, and I would have that so that civilians can sit there and contemplate those that protect us.

2621
03:44:17,755 --> 03:44:18,756
[SPEAKER_32]: But we don't have the money for that.

2622
03:44:19,156 --> 03:44:24,018
[SPEAKER_32]: So in lieu of that, I would settle for a large boulder with a brass plaque.

2623
03:44:24,078 --> 03:44:27,980
[SPEAKER_32]: But it needs to be centered someplace very special.

2624
03:44:29,300 --> 03:44:35,084
[SPEAKER_32]: It needs to be in an area that's very well kept and a boulder with a brass plaque.

2625
03:44:35,404 --> 03:44:39,067
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know it costs money, but I don't care if we have to have a bake sale for it.

2626
03:44:39,767 --> 03:44:44,510
[SPEAKER_32]: We know that we're not going to do a whole lot of other things in the near future.

2627
03:44:44,590 --> 03:44:49,974
[SPEAKER_32]: We know, unfortunately, I don't see any building going to be put up for a new station.

2628
03:44:50,294 --> 03:44:54,257
[SPEAKER_32]: We can talk about it, but we know that's not going to happen in the next two years, sadly enough.

2629
03:44:54,913 --> 03:44:59,556
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's a small token of I would love to see more training.

2630
03:44:59,616 --> 03:45:03,939
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love to see the detailed whole system gone.

2631
03:45:04,379 --> 03:45:06,841
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to see a lot of things, and I'll talk about those later on in the year.

2632
03:45:06,961 --> 03:45:07,862
[SPEAKER_32]: You know you'll hear from me.

2633
03:45:08,402 --> 03:45:16,428
[SPEAKER_32]: But one thing that we could do, because I don't think that there's a plaque for the police and for the fire in the city of Medford.

2634
03:45:16,468 --> 03:45:18,309
[SPEAKER_32]: And I've seen them in other communities.

2635
03:45:18,449 --> 03:45:22,312
[SPEAKER_32]: I saw one in Plymouth, Mass, and it was really nice.

2636
03:45:22,672 --> 03:45:24,013
[SPEAKER_32]: And it was just along the walkway,

2637
03:45:25,069 --> 03:45:26,889
[SPEAKER_32]: It was in a special place along the ocean.

2638
03:45:27,350 --> 03:45:30,610
[SPEAKER_32]: And it was a place that was, it has to be a very nice place.

2639
03:45:30,670 --> 03:45:37,652
[SPEAKER_32]: If you're only going to give them a boulder with a brass plaque, don't put it in between two parked cars.

2640
03:45:37,692 --> 03:45:38,112
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what I mean?

2641
03:45:38,852 --> 03:45:40,112
[SPEAKER_32]: It has to be in a very special place.

2642
03:45:40,492 --> 03:45:43,953
[SPEAKER_32]: And so that's what I would recommend to whoever the people are in charge of that.

2643
03:45:45,073 --> 03:45:52,615
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's not asking too much, because our police and our fire are taking it on the chin.

2644
03:45:53,078 --> 03:45:57,000
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to prepare them for mass events, because they are literally the front line.

2645
03:45:57,460 --> 03:46:00,162
[SPEAKER_32]: The National Guard has been depleted, and they're overseas.

2646
03:46:00,742 --> 03:46:04,924
[SPEAKER_32]: So when you call for help, the people coming are going to be the police and the fire.

2647
03:46:05,445 --> 03:46:11,428
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just want to point that out, and hopefully we can get them some kind of recognition.

2648
03:46:11,508 --> 03:46:11,768
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2649
03:46:14,456 --> 03:46:14,896
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Ms.

2650
03:46:14,916 --> 03:46:15,236
[SPEAKER_29]: Martin.

2651
03:46:15,317 --> 03:46:18,038
[SPEAKER_29]: On the motion of council night to receive and place on file.

2652
03:46:18,058 --> 03:46:20,720
[SPEAKER_29]: All those in favor of those opposed motion carries.

2653
03:46:21,760 --> 03:46:25,602
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, on the motion of Councilor, uh, care of yellow to table 16-six 73.

2654
03:46:26,002 --> 03:46:30,625
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, all those in favor, all those opposed motion carries.

2655
03:46:32,046 --> 03:46:37,429
[SPEAKER_29]: And we took the reports of the committees, which I didn't see on that back page.

2656
03:46:38,469 --> 03:46:39,410
