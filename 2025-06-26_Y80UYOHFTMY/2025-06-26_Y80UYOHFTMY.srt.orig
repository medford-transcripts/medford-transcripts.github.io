6
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:14,388

7
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call the meeting to order.

[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the call?

26
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,552
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on mute, Danielle.

27
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I remember to do that.

28
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just me tonight.

29
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:53,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Danielle Evans, senior planner from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

30
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

31
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:06,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, before I continue, do you want to make any introductory comments about this?

32
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:16,972
[SPEAKER_07]: The first item, which is 1 Cabot Road, the first and only proposal we have before us this evening is 1 Cabot Road is for a special permit and a site plan review.

33
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:34,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so, um, tonight, the Community Development Board is the referral board City Council is the special permit granting authority and the site plan review authority for a medical office use in the office zoning district.

34
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:49,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So it needs a special permit, and it's subject to site plan review because it qualifies as a major project, because it's a change in use over 10,000 square feet.

35
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a technicality.

36
00:02:53,613 --> 00:03:00,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not constructing a new building, but the size of the re-tenanting and fit-out triggers that review.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what is before you tonight.

38
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:06,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

39
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:15,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm just going to go right in and have the applicant please introduce yourselves and you can go right into presenting the proposal from there.

40
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair and Danielle.

41
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:24,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Will I have magical sharing powers through Zoom?

42
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I can make you a co-host.

43
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

44
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:30,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Promise to behave.

45
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.

46
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Andrew Fuqua.

47
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:41,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the general counsel of Cambridge Health Alliance.

48
00:03:42,590 --> 00:04:07,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And joining me from Cambridge Health Alliance tonight is our Alison Brisson, our Vice President of Facilities and Support Services, David Farmer, our Senior Director of Facilities Design and Construction, Tom Leslie, our Director of Real Estate, and our outside counsel, Paul Feldman of Davis Mom.

49
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,176
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, also attending are

50
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:24,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason Badricchi of the Davis Companies, the property owner for the proposed development project, and Chris Anglici of E4H Architecture.

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now going to attempt to present the screen.

52
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to go here and share.

53
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And am I successfully sharing?

54
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:44,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

55
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

56
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:55,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.

57
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,165
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the introductory slide.

58
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:12,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to start with just a brief introduction and explanation of Cambridge Health Alliance for those of you who may not be familiar with CHA.

59
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Cambridge Health Alliance is a public health care system that was created

60
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:19,892
[SPEAKER_04]: by special act of the Massachusetts legislature in 1996.

61
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:37,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It was formed from the spinoff of the then Cambridge City Hospital and merging into or with Somerville Hospital and it later acquired Witten Hospital at the request of the state in 2001.

62
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:49,174
[SPEAKER_04]: The mission of CHA as a safety net organization is to improve the health of our communities.

63
00:05:49,334 --> 00:06:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And our primary service area are the communities of Medford, Malden, Chelsea, Revere, Somerville, and Cambridge.

64
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:06,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And we specialize in and our focus is in the care of underserved populations.

65
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: We operate two, as I mentioned, two inpatient acute care hospital campuses, one in Cambridge and one in Everett.

66
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:30,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Somerville campus now is an inpatient psychiatry facility for youth, children and adolescents.

67
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:44,644
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, and the real core of CHA's business, is that we operate 15 ambulatory clinics throughout our service area, including four school-based health centers.

68
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are throughout Revere, Everett, Malden, Somerville, and Cambridge, and hopefully Medford.

69
00:06:53,612 --> 00:07:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And we provide a varying mix of services in each of these sites, from primary care to behavioral health to medical specialty services.

70
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:10,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Our primary care panel is approximately 128,000 patients.

71
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:10,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So we provide a

72
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:25,194
[SPEAKER_04]: services to a large segment of the population, but as far as hospitals in the state go, we are relatively small.

73
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: What brings us before the board this evening?

74
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:50,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently operate, or CJA currently operates a care center in Assembly Square, more or less across the parking lot from the Home Depot, for those of you who are familiar with the Home Depot.

75
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:58,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a 26,000 square foot site, but we're being,

76
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:15,738
[SPEAKER_04]: required to, even though the site has worked wonderfully in an office building, we're being required to vacate that space because the building is going to be torn down and replaced with lab space.

77
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will need to vacate by September, end of September in 2025.

78
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we were looking for

79
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:50,920
[SPEAKER_04]: replacement space for the Assembly Square Care Center, the Davis companies reached out to us and we found that OneCabit presented just a fantastic relocation opportunity for the services that CHA is going to be providing to the patients we serve.

80
00:08:53,249 --> 00:09:01,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Among other things, it's a great location, very accessible, and it was very important for us also to

81
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:08,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to be in Medford, it's one thing to say that one serves the Medford community.

82
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:13,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another to actually be within a community that one serves.

83
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:27,702
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have signed up a 15-year lease with the Davis companies for about 56,000 rentable square feet on the second floor of the building at 1 Cabot Road.

84
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: As I noted is a very accessible location and it's actually we find that it's closer to public transportation than the assembly square site and it's also closer to many of the patients that we serve.

85
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to reach and it has.

86
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:49,896
[SPEAKER_04]: plenty of parking.

87
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:55,319
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, that was really one of the key factors in considering the location.

88
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:09,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And under the lease, we have 3.25 spaces per 1,000 square feet under the lease, which is much greater than the zoning requirement of less than one.

89
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,874
[SPEAKER_04]: The timetable for the project is that we would open up the clinic in late summer of 2025.

90
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as a reminder, um, or a refresher on the building, because, um, I'm not sure.

91
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:34,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how long all the members of the board have been on the board.

92
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:37,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, 1 cab at road is located within a.

93
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: the office zoning district, all of its existing property improvements fully complied with all zoning dimensional requirements.

94
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:57,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The building itself is approximately 300,000 square feet, and the building coverage is less than 24% of the lot.

95
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It has 941 parking spaces available.

96
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumping back to what CHA will be doing within the space, all services that we'll be providing will be outpatient services.

97
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,259
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no inpatient services.

98
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,960
[SPEAKER_04]: These will be primary care services, will be the major service that we're offering there.

99
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:32,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also provide orthopedics and rehab services there.

100
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be limited on-site outpatient laboratory services so that patients don't need to travel for various draws that may be required.

101
00:11:45,161 --> 00:12:00,975
[SPEAKER_04]: some procedure suites for non-surgical ambulatory procedures that can be done in a doctor's office, a pharmacy for our patients so that they can pick up drug, their medications while on site.

102
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:09,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also will house our occupational employee and employee health services in this location.

103
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a rendering of the overall plan for the clinic.

104
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:27,322
[SPEAKER_04]: This has got a lot of small, small, indecipherable colors and words on it.

105
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a breakdown.

106
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:34,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back, we're starting here near the entrance.

107
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,709
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll enter in the elevator lobby here.

108
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:49,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Up near the top of the screen where the cursor is, is our main lobby and central registration area.

109
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: To the left is where the procedure suite will be built.

110
00:12:56,076 --> 00:13:00,998
[SPEAKER_04]: To the right is the outpatient lab and x-ray for patients.

111
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:11,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Down at the bottom is the pharmacy and where our occupational health services will be provided.

112
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: The meat of the clinic is on the next slide.

113
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:25,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And this here, we will have primary care exam rooms and services at the top.

114
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:38,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll have our orthopedics, podiatry and physiatry services offered in these exam rooms in the middle where I'm circling the cursor.

115
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:50,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way that these exam rooms are designed is there will be some ability to flex back and forth between services to meet patient need and demand.

116
00:13:52,578 --> 00:14:04,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, down at the bottom is where we will have our physical therapy and rehab area, which then brings us back out to the main entrance.

117
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:12,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That concludes the presentation portion.

118
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:18,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, Madam Chair, we are willing to entertain

119
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,961
[SPEAKER_04]: any questions that the board may have.

120
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

121
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:29,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney Fuqua?

122
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuqua or Fuqua, either way.

123
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:33,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

124
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for your presentation.

125
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:36,932
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

126
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:44,858
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, I'm going to, before I open it up to the board, I want to know if, Danielle, do you have any questions?

127
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:48,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Or did you have anything you wanted to point out?

128
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:57,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a few clarifying questions myself and I will open it up to the board, but I didn't know if you had any on behalf of the city.

129
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:06,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask if the team had reviewed the comments from our director of traffic and transportation on any of the.

130
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:21,504
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations, particularly around additional EV parking, additional bike parking, bike racks outside, and the recommendation for restriping a bicycle lane.

131
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:36,348
[SPEAKER_06]: There are, you know, as there is, you know, substantial parking in the lot, but, and the use will generate quite a few more trips than the existing use, so we're trying to, you know, shift

132
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,972
[SPEAKER_06]: more of those vehicle trips to bike and pedestrian trips if possible.

133
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:47,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And those would help in that regard.

134
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:59,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And just wondering if there were any objections to those recommendations, if we were, if the board was to add them as recommended conditions tonight.

135
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I can, Andy, I'd like to introduce myself.

136
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:06,975
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Paul Feldman.

137
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an attorney at Davis Bomb.

138
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I represent CHA.

139
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:17,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of entitlement work, a lot of zoning work in the various cities and towns in the Commonwealth.

140
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have appeared before a hundred different cities and towns, but I don't have a recollection of when the last time I was in Memphis.

141
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:28,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some time ago.

142
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad I'm glad to be back.

143
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:39,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could walk through what Danielle was just asking about.

144
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:42,048
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, with regard to parking,

145
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:54,172
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the important things that CHA looks at when it's doing its due diligence regarding the appropriateness of a site is adequacy of parking.

146
00:16:54,492 --> 00:17:02,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things it negotiates into its lease is knowing that it'll have parking available to meet its needs.

147
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,981
[SPEAKER_03]: In this particular case,

148
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:14,570
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 182 spaces that are potentially available to CHA.

149
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:22,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is actually, in the lease, and maybe we can bring it up in handy, I would ask you if you could share your screen again.

150
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:26,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We took the Ulta plan and we marked it up a little bit.

151
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:32,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There is going to be a dedicated patient parking area of 75 cars.

152
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:39,515
[SPEAKER_03]: that will be

153
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:43,339
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated to the CHA patients.

154
00:17:44,240 --> 00:18:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look at the operation of the facility in, when it's at full capacity, we expect 75 cars to be about, have a 15% excess capacity of what we expect our need to be.

155
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:07,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And CHA has tremendous amount of statistics as it pays attention to its operations at all its facilities.

156
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So the parking area that's designated in the lease in the upper right-hand corner says patient parking 75 spaces.

157
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:24,322
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 74 spaces that are designated in the garage on lot 7.

158
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That is predominantly going to be used for employee parking.

159
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,265
[SPEAKER_03]: doctors and nurses.

160
00:18:38,686 --> 00:19:00,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Again CHA has a program where its employees that are using their car participate in parking permit programming within the hospital system and they know from their other facilities that again 74 spaces were more than a

161
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,451
[SPEAKER_03]: accommodate that demand.

162
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:11,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's an additional 33 spaces that's in the office garage itself and a couple of entrances are designated.

163
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:23,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to answer the question, you know, will there be, you know, dedicated parking area for patients so that repeat patients will know where they should go and park?

164
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:24,283
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is yes.

165
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:28,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is laid out in our lease and it's presented on this exhibit plan.

166
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, there are, uh, existing, uh, 30 interior bike racks.

167
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,552
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 5 exterior bike racks.

168
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Davis company advises us that.

169
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an enormous amount of capacity in their interior bike rack room when we.

170
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:59,108
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three or four bikes are regularly using that room so there's plenty of capacity for additional users.

171
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither the property owner and upon our investigation feel a need to increase

172
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:28,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Bike racks, we appreciated the comment by the transportation director because it actually had us look into it for preparation for tonight to make sure that there's adequate room for biking needs.

173
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:34,783
[SPEAKER_03]: The director of traffic made a comment about adding some EV spaces.

174
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,684
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked into that with the property owner.

175
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:44,816
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four spaces right now on site that have charging capability.

176
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:54,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't find them on ChargePoint, even though if somebody is a member of ChargePoint, that's how they use the

177
00:20:55,563 --> 00:21:03,669
[SPEAKER_03]: The spaces, you don't find them on charge point because they're for the tenants of the building.

178
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:10,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not intended to create public charging.

179
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:17,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, to try to figure out that there was adequate capacity, we talked to the property owner.

180
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:32,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I could turn it over to the property owner, but the bottom line is they have statistics that they get from ChargePoint about how much those spaces are used on an hourly basis in a year.

181
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:40,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that not even two spaces out of the four are being fully utilized.

182
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:53,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I could turn it over to Jason from the Davis companies, but he advises that the Davis company is very proactive in meeting tenant need and in tenant demand.

183
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:54,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it.

184
00:21:55,493 --> 00:22:02,977
[SPEAKER_03]: If the demand increases over time, they voluntarily installed the four spaces that are at the property now.

185
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time this building was constructed and was originally approved, electric cars were type dream for all of us.

186
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:20,207
[SPEAKER_03]: They voluntarily installed the systems to respond to tenant interest and

187
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:25,890
[SPEAKER_03]: As the need grows, they're prepared to address that.

188
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:40,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we thank the parking director for having us look into it, but we completely satisfied ourselves that there's excess capacity at the moment for charging of electric vehicles at the site.

189
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:50,479
[SPEAKER_03]: There's questions about encouraging use of alternative means of transportation and that's something that

190
00:22:52,197 --> 00:22:53,778
[SPEAKER_03]: PHA is prepared to do.

191
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:10,633
[SPEAKER_03]: As our traffic assessment indicates, you know, we'll provide a welcome packet to new employees and we provide a transit subsidy, TPAS subsidy to our employees.

192
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:18,100
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the traffic assessment report that was submitted by Van Ness at the end of the report,

193
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:38,776
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a series of recommendations that are made by the traffic consultant for purposes of trying to mitigate car demand and reduce vehicle traffic trips and if the

194
00:23:39,383 --> 00:24:08,327
[SPEAKER_03]: planning if the community development board wanted to recommend that the project be conditioned to comply with those recommendations of our traffic consultant that is absolutely acceptable uh to to the applicant to to cha um the other comment is regarding uh um striping of public ways that that's really beyond the capability of the applicant it's cha has never been asked to

195
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:19,377
[SPEAKER_03]: To do that, um, we would we would hope that, um, because the board has the access card on this property that with the substantial.

196
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Tax revenue that's generated by this property owner that.

197
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully would be DPW would have the resources to.

198
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:33,356
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary in this city.

199
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not something that CHA feels comfortable that it can take on or would want to take on, particularly on public rights of way.

200
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:54,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that hits all of the items, Danielle, that Todd Blake set forth in his comment letter.

201
00:24:56,604 --> 00:25:02,932
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's any follow-up, we're happy to respond further.

202
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, may I respond?

203
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:04,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

204
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:11,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, I'm very, I guess, dismayed about the

205
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: the existing tenants and their EV charging use.

206
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the planning department alone, there's four of us that own EVs, and we only have two charging stations at City Hall, and we're always battling it out for those spaces.

207
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:34,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And the provision of the EV chargers at our workplace was actually a large reason why

208
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:41,124
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a decision that we even bought them because you can charge at work.

209
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:53,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And also when I choose to patronize different businesses, the availability of EV charging is a consideration for me as well.

210
00:25:53,211 --> 00:26:05,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I was a patient coming to CHA and you're there for a good, usually like an hour, two hours, that's the perfect time to kind of like top off your car in the patient area.

211
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:25,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the EV chargers are now are on the complete opposite side of the building, and so are not a convenient space for patients or visitors to use, though they would be a great spot for, you know, employees and staff who would know that they're there or in the garage.

212
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I would

213
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:35,382
[SPEAKER_06]: recommend that CHA consider adding at least one charging station in the

214
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:54,296
[SPEAKER_06]: patient parking area, as well as exterior bike racks near the entrance so that folks can actually bike there and secure their bicycle and then go into the building.

215
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's two user groups.

216
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There's staff and employees that are there all day.

217
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:09,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the folks that are coming to the medical office, which is the, I would defer to your traffic engineer or to

218
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:22,380
[SPEAKER_06]: our board member Peter Calvis, which is driving the increased vehicle trips, and we want to convert as many of those to non-vehicle trips if possible.

219
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:24,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

220
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:27,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me respond by saying this.

221
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We're certainly open to talking with the landlord about adding a

222
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:43,372
[SPEAKER_03]: another post with two charges, so to activate another two spots.

223
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:55,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be challenging, and I wouldn't want to overcommit CHA to locate that in the patient parking area because, again, I don't know where the electrical supply is coming from.

224
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:59,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be an extraordinarily expensive

225
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:11,547
[SPEAKER_03]: retrofit in this situation that would not be a good resource, a use of resources for CHA, you know, as a public hospital.

226
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:18,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does, and its resources are not nearly as much as its need.

227
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:21,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very conscientious about its budget.

228
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:33,504
[SPEAKER_03]: But having said that, we could talk to the landlord and work to the landlord about adding or being able to activate 2 additional spaces.

229
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:41,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I would suspect it would be in the proximity of where the current EV is just because of electric use, but I don't know that for sure.

230
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:55,478
[SPEAKER_03]: If the building owner says, no, we could tie into an electric conduit that's proximate and do it at a reasonable cost, we're not ready to that location.

231
00:28:55,538 --> 00:29:07,524
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason why I'm commenting it and not wanting to create an expectation about the parking patient area is it's a little bit away from the front of the building.

232
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to walk over to it.

233
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:18,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to resist that that's what it's going to take adding a couple of EV spots.

234
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to respond that way.

235
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if there's another set of bike racks that the board thinks is appropriate that should be added, if the property owner is going to give us a spot to be able to do that, and I assume the property owner will help us find something, we'll get another set of bike racks out there as well.

236
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:52,209
[SPEAKER_03]: The final comment I'll make is that Jeff Durk, when he wrote the traffic assessment report, was careful to say that all the numbers he presented to the board here does not include any reduction.

237
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,308
[SPEAKER_03]: because of public transportation use or other alternative means of transportation other than vehicle trips.

238
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:14,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did that purposely because he wanted to analyze whether or not the traffic situation could handle the complete worst case.

239
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does, and he indicated that it does.

240
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But the practical reality is CHA knows that from its patient population that many, many of its users, most of its users use public transportation and the proximity of the Wellington stop is really makes this particular facility accessible.

241
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:45,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of the staff of CHA use carpooling and other means.

242
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So while

243
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Turk was careful to say, look, I'm not reducing these traffic numbers.

244
00:30:54,908 --> 00:31:00,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The practical reality is that they overstate the demand.

245
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:06,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just trying to give the community board a sense of how many additional vehicle trips we might expect.

246
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:10,059
[SPEAKER_03]: from a medical office use instead of a generic office use.

247
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:25,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And even under those circumstances, the adjacent road network is adequate to accommodate additional traffic without creating any unnecessary or additional queuing delays or other traffic delays.

248
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:32,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Feldman.

249
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:34,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate your responses.

250
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:43,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things, the onus now is on the board to pretty much weigh what's reasonable and what we can recommend to the city council at this point.

251
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:53,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And with it being a site plan, as Daniel has already laid out, it's not really triggering all the comments from the city department as outside of transportation.

252
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:58,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And with it being a special use, a special permit with the change of use,

253
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:08,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, our due diligence is making sure that, um, we are trying to, um, abide by the reform standards and zoning ordinances as set forth.

254
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:21,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so in saying that I'm going to, I believe that you have, uh, successfully answered my responses, but I'm going to open it up to the rest of the board to see if there's anything that they want to, um, add.

255
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that Peter has his hand raised.

256
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:31,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, go ahead.

257
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:34,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

258
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question was regarding the, let me look at it, it's in Director Blake's comments, regarding the,

259
00:32:54,908 --> 00:33:01,413
[SPEAKER_02]: reallocation of current employee parking for visitor parking.

260
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, I'm not really sure who this is a question for, whether this is a question for the applicant or the landlord or maybe attorney Foucault, if you can help me understand this.

261
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:22,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks to me from the parking layout that you submitted that there will be some reallocation of that parking.

262
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:35,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that kind of addresses that concern somewhat because obviously you don't have as much employee parking when it's not solely an office.

263
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:45,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some of Director Blake's concern with regards to parking is going to be addressed for the patient parking.

264
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:57,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, not to cut you off and not to speak for the applicant, but I believe that's when they presented 182 spaces available to CHA and 75 will be for patients.

265
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct in saying that?

266
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that addresses... Yes.

267
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

268
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:04,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

269
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:05,212
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

270
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:09,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at a lot of numbers and I just wanted to get some clarification on that.

271
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, uh, uh,

272
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, one of the recommendations that I wanted to speak in favor of is wayfinding, because I do believe that, I do agree with Tony Feldman that a lot of the users of this facility will be accessing it from the Wellington stop, and as someone who lives near the Wellington stop, I certainly know that area and that routing, and I would encourage

273
00:34:42,613 --> 00:35:02,509
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought would be to encourage between the property owner and CHA to have some kind of wayfinding to direct people who are coming from Wellington to the CHA facility, especially because it will be a new facility.

274
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:09,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will have people who presumably are coming to the area who haven't been around that area before and to make sure they know how to get there.

275
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:12,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good point.

276
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:18,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason, who you see on the screen is a from the Davis companies.

277
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:38,523
[SPEAKER_03]: When we saw that, I mean, I forgot to mention this from from Todd Blake, we followed up with him and he pointed out that a couple of years ago, and Jason, maybe you could speak to this signage and a lot of improvements were made to direct people correctly to one cabinet.

278
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:39,544
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jason, you

279
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,526
[SPEAKER_03]: You know those details better than I do.

280
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:48,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the, the improvements to the pedestrian walkway under route 16 were done when that when the bridge was redone.

281
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:54,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the actual actual way finding getting to our building.

282
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:59,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you get off the T, you can see, you can see the sign that we have on the building at the top that says 1 cabin road.

283
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:14,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would be able to put any signage on the MBTA's land, but I can certainly, you know, at the corner of our lot where our sidewalk begins, you know, look at adding a sign there to get them onto our sidewalk and, you know, to our entrance.

284
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:21,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would, I think, be good because I know

285
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not always sure where the entrance is for one cabin.

286
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I walked past it to get home from work early today.

287
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two of them.

288
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:39,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a rear entrance, which is where you would end up going if you came from the T. You'd end up coming in the back.

289
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:48,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so another thing to note is we do also run a shuttle during rush hour from our front entrance to Wellington.

290
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:57,572
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a couple hundred yards away, but for people who can't get around, we run that three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

291
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:03,236
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all just like EV charging and just like bike racks, we're monitoring usage.

292
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:05,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there was demand, we'd look at altering it.

293
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:06,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

294
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:15,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you both.

295
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:20,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just echo to what Peter said that I think that was my only additional question.

296
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:22,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was pretty much wayfinding.

297
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:28,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was how do you get people to navigate between those multimodal options that we've been discussing?

298
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:34,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do you get them from driving, biking, walking, transit, so forth within the property itself?

299
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:39,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Peter, for bringing that up.

300
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:41,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions from the board?

301
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so this is a public hearing.

302
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:53,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So hearing none, I am actually going to open it up for public hearing.

303
00:37:57,187 --> 00:38:01,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

304
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

305
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:10,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

306
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:16,720
[SPEAKER_07]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

307
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:23,525
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat for myself and staff.

308
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can you manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters about this item?

309
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:47,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do not see any participants with raised hands looking to speak, and I have not received any written comment or emails about this project.

310
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

311
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:59,369
[SPEAKER_07]: then I will close the public comment period until this meeting and we'll reopen if there are additional materials to consider going forward.

312
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:05,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So bring it back to the board.

313
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to take this time to read.

314
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:23,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to evaluate whether to bring a special permit that we must consider whether all the criteria under 9411.62 of the zoning ordinance and then the performance standards, which is section 6.4.

315
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have that backwards, I apologize.

316
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, can you please put them both up on the screen?

317
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happens when you try to move the lines, yeah.

318
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:36,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Can folks see my screen?

319
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:38,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

320
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:39,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

321
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:47,226
[SPEAKER_07]: So 11.7.10 of the zoning ordinance and the 94-11.62 special permit criteria.

322
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:59,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so when considering whether to grant a special permit, the board needs to consider the

323
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: those six criteria and whether any adverse effects of the proposed use will outweigh its beneficial impacts.

324
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:24,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't find that any of those are met or would need conditions in order to be met, that's when you would do that.

325
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:27,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So like traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading,

326
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:40,645
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to add any of the traffic conditions in order for number two to be met, it would satisfy that criteria.

327
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:50,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this point for the traffic, I believe that the applicant has fully satisfied the questions.

328
00:40:52,150 --> 00:41:01,292
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as adding additional EV, we wanna make sure that we are doing it reasonably as well as economically without providing undue economic hardship onto the proponent.

329
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:11,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And in saying that, I think I'll get a temperature feel from the rest of the board about the stipulation for adding the EV charging stations.

330
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:18,188
[SPEAKER_07]: additional EV charging stations, if you wanted to make that as a recommendation.

331
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:33,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, based on the feedback that Attorney Feldman has given regarding restriping cabin road on public land, I'm not exactly sure that we're within jurisdiction to recommend that.

332
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, did you want to say anything about that?

333
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:54,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one thing that we do as planners when, let me see, wait a minute, I just, here we go, is weigh the pros and cons.

334
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And different departments will want to see different things.

335
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:05,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's our job to find the right balance.

336
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree that I don't think that we should require any striping of the public way.

337
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:27,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that we do require for new builds for mostly private developers and sometimes just residential uses.

338
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not out of the realm of normalcy to require off-site mitigation.

339
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:38,110
[SPEAKER_06]: and traffic calming methods.

340
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:53,300
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think for this re-tenanting and fit out that maybe the nexus isn't there to require that, I still think that they should consider adding the EV spaces.

341
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:04,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But we could soften that language to should consider if feasible, which isn't a requirement, but a strong suggestion

342
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:07,465
[SPEAKER_06]: that they do that.

343
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:22,692
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a community that adopted the stretch energy code and the specialized stretch energy code, which requires 10% of all parking spaces be EV ready.

344
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:28,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure if the building permit would trigger that anyways.

345
00:43:29,015 --> 00:43:31,856
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find out once you apply for a building permit.

346
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:44,951
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of outside of my realm of expertise, but there could be things triggered just by virtue of us having adopted the stretch energy code.

347
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:50,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of our neighbors have too, including Somerville where you're leaving.

348
00:43:52,413 --> 00:44:01,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The bicycle parking, exterior bicycle parking that's convenient to visitors, I would really strongly encourage

349
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:19,685
[SPEAKER_06]: keeping that as a condition that feels like a really low, low hanging fruit, real, you know, short money kind of ticket item to add that would, I think, go a long way.

350
00:44:19,705 --> 00:44:24,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I didn't see any near the entrance, but maybe I,

351
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:26,254
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't spot them.

352
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:33,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the applicant confirm that there's no exterior bicycle parking near the entrance where patients and visitors would enter?

353
00:44:33,898 --> 00:44:38,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason, can you speak to that?

354
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:40,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there currently is not.

355
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:45,484
[SPEAKER_00]: They're around the side and covered, under cover.

356
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:50,407
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we can certainly look at locating some in the front.

357
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:03,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other clarifying questions or input from board members?

358
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:19,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to ask Daniel if you know, do you know when it comes to EV stations, what percentage of parking spots should have EV or are required to have EV in new construction?

359
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,622
[SPEAKER_06]: 10% are supposed to be EV ready.

360
00:45:29,939 --> 00:45:40,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I second basically Danielle when it comes to EV stations and strongly suggest that the CHA looks into it and its feasibility.

361
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:49,188
[SPEAKER_08]: At least one station in the patient's area would be great.

362
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:56,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if this is not feasible, then maybe add signage to direct patients to the current existing EV stations.

363
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:07,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great suggestion, Sally, because they wouldn't know that it's there at all, because it doesn't show up on the apps.

364
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:12,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Rightfully so, it's directed for tenants of the building.

365
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the easy solution, though.

366
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:21,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Ari's hand is raised, Madam Chair.

367
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:21,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari?

368
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:26,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to interrupt the current back and forth.

369
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:29,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to finish it, and then I have a separate comment.

370
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:30,447
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're on.

371
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:43,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with the suggestion to strongly recommend, but do require at a minimum signage.

372
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:55,641
[SPEAKER_05]: On a similar note with, I think that applies to the bike parking too, especially visitors who are only there occasionally should have very visible,

373
00:46:56,245 --> 00:47:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: easy bike racks at both entrances if possible, the back and the front.

374
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:06,563
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people who bring bikes on the T or might be coming from that direction.

375
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love to see that if possible.

376
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:22,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I was just actually echoing earlier with what Sally was saying about the signage for the EV.

377
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:38,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure I know, Danielle, you said you've seen it, but when we pulled it up on GIS, it was not clear that the EV stations were for tenants or whether they were for the tenants or the visitors or the patients.

378
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:45,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So the wayfinding of that, even when you find it, can we make that a little bit more clear that it is for their use?

379
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:46,747
[SPEAKER_07]: the patient use?

380
00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, through the chair, because I know when I drove around and was kind of, you know, poking around and I went up to the, you know, to the charge point, you know, whatever you call them.

381
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:08,465
[SPEAKER_06]: kiosk thingamajig, and I couldn't tell if it was something that would be open to a visitor to use or if I'd get towed.

382
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:12,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it would be helpful, you know, signage will go a long way.

383
00:48:12,988 --> 00:48:27,520
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to, you know, submit it to ChargePoint or PlugShare and have it visible, but, you know, to the general public, but it should be folks visiting the building or even working in the building should know that they're there.

384
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:31,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, maybe it's available for tenants and.

385
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:41,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Visitors or something for, like, visitors and users of the building or something so that there's.

386
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:57,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's understood that it's not public charging if you're not coming to do any kind of business at OneCabit, but it's if you're there visiting OneCabit that it's available for use and it doesn't have to be free.

387
00:48:58,082 --> 00:49:01,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It can continue to be paid for it.

388
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:14,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

389
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:26,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I've just been trying to keep track of the back and forth and wanted to make sure that we have a handle on what conditions we're proposing.

390
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:40,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, it seems that we're recommending to the city council for approval with the conditions that the applicant considers the installation of additional EV spaces

391
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:59,775
[SPEAKER_02]: if feasible with the addition of signage clarifying the use of the EV spaces or just signage mark directing to the EV spaces?

392
00:50:03,556 --> 00:50:05,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and then bicycle wrap both.

393
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:09,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you want to answer Peter's question?

394
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess so.

395
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:11,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

396
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

397
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:15,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

398
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:17,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a more appropriate answer.

399
00:50:17,076 --> 00:50:18,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said yes, but both.

400
00:50:22,438 --> 00:50:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

401
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:35,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second condition would be that the applicant work with the property owner to install bicycle racks at the entrances of the

402
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:38,871
[SPEAKER_02]: to the proposed facility?

403
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:40,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

404
00:50:41,192 --> 00:50:41,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

405
00:50:42,993 --> 00:50:45,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I have as of now.

406
00:50:47,196 --> 00:51:00,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are all the conditions that I would myself would be looking for a motion for and recommending to a special permit to the city council since they are the special permit granting authority.

407
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:05,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And Danielle, are they also in the site plan or are we recommending the site plan here?

408
00:51:06,988 --> 00:51:12,833
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also recommending the site.

409
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a point of clarification.

410
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:23,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse the fact that I'm going to get hung up on the words, but when you say, if it's feasible.

411
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,817
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, bottom line is almost anything is feasible with enough dollars if you throw enough dollars at it.

412
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would help if you in that condition says we examine the appropriateness and feasibility of adding a additional EV charging space, one charging station with that accesses two spots, you know, it's a dual head charging station, at least that way, it's not vague about

413
00:51:55,452 --> 00:52:02,376
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the order of magnitude of EVC stations you're talking about us evaluate for feasibility.

414
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:07,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll look at whether or not they could be located in the patient parking.

415
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:17,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I understand it, if they can't be located at patient parking, we provide some kind of signage to direct someone if they were looking for an EV spot where they could find it.

416
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that language, Attorney Feldman.

417
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:28,116
[SPEAKER_07]: You made it a lot easier to move forward.

418
00:52:28,196 --> 00:52:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the proponent's comfortable with that, I think that's what the city would appreciate in capturing.

419
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, did you get that language?

420
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:51,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I could always work with Danielle tomorrow on the actual, you know, drafting of the recommendation to the city council.

421
00:52:51,026 --> 00:52:53,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to help Danielle, um,

422
00:52:53,785 --> 00:53:19,550
[SPEAKER_03]: very common for me to prepare draft decisions uh for boards um but in this case i know it's a recommendation letter and i know daniel does that routinely but i'm happy to help daniel in any way i can thank you and i know that the city clerk's office um as the staff to city council would definitely welcome any help in drafting that condition and it will expedite you getting one

423
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:29,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the motion this evening, Daniel, I would have to word it and say in conditions as set forth by the city.

424
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:35,795
[SPEAKER_07]: As I set forth by the community development board drafted by the city.

425
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You would say, I mean, we could just kind of.

426
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:48,809
[SPEAKER_06]: You would recommend approval of the special permit and the site plan review with the additional conditions.

427
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be, I guess, three conditions.

428
00:53:52,712 --> 00:54:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one would be the applicant shall add or the applicant shall work with the property owner to add bicycle racks for visitors near the entrance to one cabinet or to the main entrance to one cabinet.

429
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that capture the consensus?

430
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:09,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And then

431
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,610
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one would be.

432
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

433
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:29,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pause you there and I'm going to go back and I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend one cabinet road for, uh, for special permit and site plan review to the city council based on the conditions that Danielle was going to list.

434
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:31,096
[SPEAKER_07]: You can list those.

435
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:33,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

436
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:35,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

437
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:44,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded with the comment that I'd love to see bike racks at both visitor entrances, not just the front one.

438
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I was just going to have Danielle restate them.

439
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

440
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:57,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the applicant shall work with the property owner to add bicycle racks for visitors near the entrances.

441
00:54:59,488 --> 00:55:01,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't sure that there's two.

442
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients will use both of them.

443
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:08,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't sure that there was a main one or there was a secondary one.

444
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just put near the entrances, let's keep it open like that.

445
00:55:17,002 --> 00:55:26,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the applicant shall work with the property owner to add an additional EV charging station

446
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:35,262
[SPEAKER_06]: in the vicinity of the visitor parking area, you know, to the greatest extent feasible.

447
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:42,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can wordsmith this so that it's in the correct legalese.

448
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:52,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, or if, or and, or provide signage

449
00:55:54,028 --> 00:56:06,771
[SPEAKER_06]: to direct visitors to the existing EV chargers and make clear that they are available for patient use or visitor use.

450
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:12,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had a third condition regarding wayfinding signage.

451
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: So provide wayfinding signage to direct pedestrians to the entrance to the building from Wellington Station.

452
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,254
[SPEAKER_06]: To the extent feasible?

453
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:29,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to the extent feasible within the property.

454
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:34,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can only put a sign on my property.

455
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:35,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

456
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:36,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it on the corner.

457
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it on the corner of my property, you know, closest to the underpass.

458
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:56,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack, chair, you're muted.

459
00:56:57,189 --> 00:56:57,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

460
00:56:58,369 --> 00:57:02,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, you capture that as to the extent feasible for him.

461
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:03,371
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, awesome.

462
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:04,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there a motion?

463
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:07,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I second the motion.

464
00:57:07,393 --> 00:57:08,293
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

465
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:09,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I second.

466
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:12,615
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I'm going to do a roll call.

467
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:15,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Goffman?

468
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:17,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

469
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:22,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, with enthusiasm as a patient of CHA.

470
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:25,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki?

471
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:26,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

472
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:27,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Kautz?

473
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:28,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

474
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

475
00:57:31,308 --> 00:57:31,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a yes.

476
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:34,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

477
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Fuqua.

478
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Kovner.

479
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone else.

480
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, members of the board.

481
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:41,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you, members of the board.

482
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:43,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great evening.

483
00:57:45,614 --> 00:57:45,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

484
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:46,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

485
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Your screen says R-E-G.

486
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it should say R-E-G Fishman.

487
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

488
00:58:02,628 --> 00:58:04,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Goffman is my middle name now.

489
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

490
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:13,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw the G and I couldn't see the first one, and so I apologize.

491
00:58:15,555 --> 00:58:18,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next item for tonight would be approval of minutes.

492
00:58:19,076 --> 00:58:20,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that we had minutes.

493
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:21,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, yes.

494
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:25,847
[SPEAKER_07]: There were minutes from last week.

495
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:30,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the February 7th meeting minutes.

496
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:35,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, a motion to approve the meeting minutes from February 7th.

497
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:38,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I so move.

498
00:58:41,236 --> 00:58:41,817
[SPEAKER_08]: A second.

499
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:42,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I second.

500
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:44,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I, Sally, second.

501
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

502
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

503
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:49,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

504
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:51,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki?

505
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:53,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Peter cow.

506
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:54,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

507
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

508
00:58:56,973 --> 00:58:57,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

509
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:04,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next will be miscellaneous or other updates that the city have any updates.

510
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:10,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that Alicia has joined us fresh from the permitting subcommittee meeting.

511
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:13,429
[SPEAKER_06]: were you with city council tonight Felicia?

512
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes if you don't mind actually it would be great to just mention this to you all we've talked about this that we're doing a zoning overhaul the one of the motions that councilor bears president bears made tonight was to request

513
00:59:31,243 --> 00:59:43,385
[SPEAKER_01]: to reach out to the CD board chair, the zoning board chair and the building commissioner and request thoughts, ideas, things they'd like to see changed in our zoning.

514
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:50,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So he worded it in a way that it doesn't have to go to the whole board and be a discussion topic at a meeting.

515
00:59:50,947 --> 00:59:57,248
[SPEAKER_01]: They would like stuff sooner rather than later so that we can start really actually digging into making changes.

516
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:10,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, I didn't write down the date by which they said, because it's not my job to tell you this, it's the city clerk's job, but they are requesting changes.

517
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:19,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the next few days, we are gonna push out basically a little form to the public with two questions.

518
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to see changed in Medford zoning?

519
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:25,663
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you not want us to touch in Medford zoning?

520
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that we've done a lot of outreach.

521
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,304
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the comprehensive plan.

522
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:31,245
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done all of that.

523
01:00:31,685 --> 01:00:35,027
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could imagine people might have a pet peeve, you know?

524
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:38,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I think setbacks should be six feet instead of 15.

525
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:39,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

526
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us build three-story houses.

527
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:42,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what people are going to say.

528
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,413
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like it's time.

529
01:00:45,553 --> 01:00:47,634
[SPEAKER_01]: If people have their pet peeves, they want to send in.

530
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:49,676
[SPEAKER_07]: No more housing.

531
01:00:49,736 --> 01:00:51,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't fit any more housing in Mefrin.

532
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:53,298
[SPEAKER_01]: No more housing.

533
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:53,959
[SPEAKER_01]: You're joking.

534
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:56,141
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

535
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

536
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:58,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw him joking.

537
01:00:58,644 --> 01:00:58,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

538
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first thing that came to mind when you said public.

539
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:03,669
You're channeling.

540
01:01:03,689 --> 01:01:04,090
That I get.

541
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:22,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say that what in our minds, what we're sort of thinking of a process is like, if you have a list, you want to send me or any member, send me a list, right?

542
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:33,264
[SPEAKER_01]: If individuals want to make like a couple, like a comment or two, or just an idea, we want to funnel those through this web form.

543
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:35,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll all show up in one document.

544
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be collected because if we told the public to email me,

545
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:41,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be losing them, right?

546
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:43,450
[SPEAKER_01]: That would become a management nightmare.

547
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to set up a special email address or anything.

548
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:50,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to put up a form to channel comments into.

549
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:59,908
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am actually… If you feel like you're going to write treaties on this, then just send an email to me and I'll pass it along to the team.

550
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So…

551
01:02:01,737 --> 01:02:05,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see the site plan review process change, but I'm just one person.

552
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,383
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think what we really want to hear from you and is how do you want to have it changed?

553
01:02:12,883 --> 01:02:16,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it could be like, so there are a couple of ways also to approach it.

554
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:23,769
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys if we had a meeting that was going to be short, and we wanted to put an agenda item on for us to talk it through.

555
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:30,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I could even invite Emily, the consultant to come and to hear hear it or one of her staff, she now has a staff.

556
01:02:31,563 --> 01:02:37,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a staff she's eight staff to come and like capture these thoughts and ideas right.

557
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:44,693
[SPEAKER_01]: If, however, that is not going to fit in our meeting schedule, especially because we're really trying to get moving on this quickly.

558
01:02:46,718 --> 01:02:58,265
[SPEAKER_01]: then if you wanted like one person from the board to sit with me or Danielle or Emily directly and talk it through, that could be arranged too.

559
01:02:58,605 --> 01:03:06,930
[SPEAKER_01]: We just can't have a quorum meeting about it offline about business of the board.

560
01:03:11,212 --> 01:03:16,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm putting it out there and especially whatever it is about site plan review that you don't like,

561
01:03:17,428 --> 01:03:32,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually in zoning and certain things are required by 40 a but certain things certain some stuff is just made up either by Medford or by the person who wrote our last round of zoning shall remain nameless, you know, like.

562
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It it just needs some major in my opinion.

563
01:03:37,948 --> 01:04:01,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be overhauled It needs some major revisions and i'm not even sure that I have that kind of time this week to even send To you what I would like to see but I can definitely touch upon it That's right Absolutely And it's only 7 45 and it's yes Although it was not an agenda.

564
01:04:01,941 --> 01:04:04,342
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of an administrative update and not a

565
01:04:06,268 --> 01:04:07,349
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a meeting next week.

566
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:26,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long it'll be, but you can... If you have some... If you wanted us to, actually, we could put zoning updates and zoning changes as an agenda item, and then

567
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:39,633
[SPEAKER_01]: If we say the update is we're meeting regularly with the consultant there, we gave you an update, or if the update is that we want to actually have a discussion about something in the zoning.

568
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:41,713
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.

569
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:52,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Then everything will come through you all anyways for you to make recommendations, changes to

570
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will see everything eventually.

571
01:04:57,086 --> 01:05:08,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to have your ideas front loaded, so that's.

572
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:16,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I would rather have, if there are thoughts and ideas of the planning board, give them to us.

573
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:17,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put them in with the consultant.

574
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's churn it out at the right time in the right section.

575
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:49,460
[SPEAKER_01]: as part of the public process um so that it's because we're you know we're going to do short-term changes we're going to do edits and we're going to do bigger changes that might take longer um right now the city council is planning to meet approximately every two weeks about this zoning or is it once a month it's two weeks so the next one is um april 11th and then april 24th hold on i just

576
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:52,264
[SPEAKER_01]: double check that they were in my calendar.

577
01:05:52,744 --> 01:06:02,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So the planning and zoning committee of the city council is planning to meet every two weeks on opposite weeks from this committee from this board.

578
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just talking about

579
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:22,805
[SPEAKER_01]: The 10th of April is a city council planning and zoning subcommittee.

580
01:06:23,965 --> 01:06:26,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And then April 24th are the next two meetings.

581
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:40,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I am mildly confused about what happened to the 27th, unless they have some other thing, but I have to be at a Broadway court or a charrette.

582
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me actually just fill you in.

583
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,270
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that we're doing a zoning,

584
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:48,386
[SPEAKER_01]: study with Somerville about Broadway Corridor.

585
01:06:49,186 --> 01:06:51,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is going to be a public charrette.

586
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:56,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Somerville likes to do these big, long things.

587
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,673
[SPEAKER_01]: They originally wanted it to be for three days.

588
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, hold on, I have what's in my calendar, but I also have the email that I received today with the updated schedule.

589
01:07:09,499 --> 01:07:09,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

590
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be on March 25th, a community meeting from 6 to 8.

591
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: On Tuesday, the 26th, open public drop-in hours from 3 to 5.

592
01:07:24,619 --> 01:07:30,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the 27th, a work-in-progress presentation from 7 to 9.

593
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:33,485
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a meeting on the 27th.

594
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:34,025
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

595
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

596
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:36,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Ours is next week.

597
01:07:36,647 --> 01:07:37,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

598
01:07:37,348 --> 01:07:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ours is next week.

599
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:39,749
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

600
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:51,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's not talk about the nine to three on the Tuesday with different staff and elected officials and stuff that I'm probably gonna have to be at the whole thing.

601
01:07:56,499 --> 01:08:04,402
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, it's a little insight into how Somerville does it when they have tons and tons of staff.

602
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:16,991
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave them permission to flyer in Medford because they have staff with the time to go door to door putting out flyers and telling people about it.

603
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:22,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three projects in Somerville, there's a different planner and a different engineer for each one.

604
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:32,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you proposing zoning updates and changes for our next meeting in March?

605
01:08:32,436 --> 01:08:40,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at this point, I want to keep it to the short meeting because we just put this on just to make sure that we got it to happen.

606
01:08:40,538 --> 01:08:40,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

607
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:47,239
[SPEAKER_01]: If next week you guys wanted to do a little brainstorming kind of thing, like they didn't have to be fleshed out ideas.

608
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:55,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the things that we have on our list that we've just given Emily is like, here are problems that we see.

609
01:08:56,281 --> 01:08:56,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

610
01:08:56,801 --> 01:09:00,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, some are real simple, like, technical.

611
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:11,072
[SPEAKER_01]: In our use tables are parking and loading codes, which reference numbers in another table.

612
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:16,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we just have the parking and loading requirements right there in the table?

613
01:09:17,056 --> 01:09:19,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they codes referencing another table?

614
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:20,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super confusing.

615
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:21,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

616
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,222
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, just, that's almost clerical.

617
01:09:26,619 --> 01:09:33,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have things like there are uses that are not defined in our zoning that probably should be like our use table.

618
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:47,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And the example I used tonight at city council was that the only restaurant food establishment stuff we have is food establishment, food establishments and food establishments with drive-through.

619
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:51,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody wants to say have a coffee shop,

620
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:57,513
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to get a use and it's not allowed in that zone.

621
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,514
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to use variants for food establishment.

622
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:11,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what if the zoning board or whoever is saying, well, actually, a coffee shop would be great there, but a full blown restaurant would be too much at that location?

623
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:12,539
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way.

624
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:14,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it runs with the land.

625
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:15,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

626
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:18,327
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to say that in our zoning.

627
01:10:18,788 --> 01:10:26,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example would be we should have a use type of coffee shops and a separate use type of restaurants.

628
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:30,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we want to have a use type of fast food restaurants.

629
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:31,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

630
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:36,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that what the held up with the bear garden was, going back and forth with the bear garden?

631
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:38,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we couldn't define, I mean, bear.

632
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:40,550
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it defined?

633
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:40,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

634
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,251
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a brewery.

635
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a restaurant.

636
01:10:44,252 --> 01:10:44,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But right.

637
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:47,353
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only thing we have is food establishment.

638
01:10:47,713 --> 01:10:49,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some of the examples, right?

639
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:51,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that there are uses that we should have.

640
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to hear like,

641
01:10:54,395 --> 01:11:01,657
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to look at the use table and tell me uses they think we should have so that we could zone differently, that would be great.

642
01:11:02,497 --> 01:11:10,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, there's some paranormal uses in here that were like, why?

643
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,000
[SPEAKER_01]: In what NIMBY world are these called out as separate uses?

644
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:33,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And also think about, you know, when we, even like tonight an example is, you know, things that you would want to require that maybe we don't have the teeth to require.

645
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:41,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, such as like the EV parking and stuff.

646
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:45,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this is a question for Alicia, for you and Brenda of,

647
01:11:46,976 --> 01:11:56,679
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what exactly, like, so like a tenant fit out, like what are, you know, what does that trigger under the specialized energy code?

648
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:11,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So Brenda just sent me a list of climate zoning brainstorms that I'm going to send to the, I'm calling it the zoning team, Danielle and the consultants, pardon me, Kit and Zach.

649
01:12:13,015 --> 01:12:24,526
[SPEAKER_01]: that talks about particular density bonuses, floor area ratio exclusions, expedited site plan review, perhaps if it's a net zero design or passive house.

650
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:27,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these are just sort of like things we should be considering.

651
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:31,253
[SPEAKER_01]: By right, allowances for EV charging.

652
01:12:31,633 --> 01:12:34,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually allow solar arrays by right.

653
01:12:37,331 --> 01:12:48,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that, small scale green infrastructure, like permeable paving, our zoning had said around parking that parking has to be paved.

654
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:57,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it kind of went on to say is that it has to be not dusty.

655
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:00,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other ways to treat that now.

656
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:10,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the 1950s and 60s when they wrote this, there was a lot of concern about dirt driveways and the dirt and how that would be bad for the people around it.

657
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:19,772
[SPEAKER_01]: But there wasn't really any thought about like, oh, there are pavers, there are grass pavers that could be used for driveways.

658
01:13:21,573 --> 01:13:24,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyhow, I thought was was the best and you wanted it.

659
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:44,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Yeah, that would that would be an interesting question because I was a little with the ev and that's not having our own attorney was just a little bit difficult, especially with them stay in the case And it's not they're not doing much on the exterior and it's just like tenants but out and they're uh retaining pretty much How do we?

660
01:13:45,482 --> 01:13:48,504
[SPEAKER_07]: enforce it now with the stretch code coming later.

661
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:54,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And I definitely understand where, Daniel, you were coming from in the city's stance, but it's kind of hard, right?

662
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:57,550
[SPEAKER_07]: But how do we go forward?

663
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

664
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:02,494
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things to consider.

665
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:09,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So for projects that are subject to site plan review, what should they be doing?

666
01:14:09,418 --> 01:14:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: What should be a requirement?

667
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And perhaps it's a requirement and things could could be waived if requested, but the default should be you're doing this, you know, unless you request some kind of a waiver, maybe that's the solution, instead of trying to, like, you know, force someone to do something like have them make the argument that it's, you know, a hardship or not feasible.

668
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:45,622
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, yeah, I do want to respect your time since this was kind of an emergency special meeting.

669
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:47,885
[SPEAKER_07]: One question.

670
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:49,126
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we looking at?

671
01:14:49,446 --> 01:14:50,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Harvard Street.

672
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:57,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I sort of poke around and I see like a glass kind of, what is it, auto glass thing?

673
01:14:57,095 --> 01:14:57,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

674
01:14:57,976 --> 01:14:59,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just one thing for next week?

675
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:04,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, because 290 sound street is requesting a continuance.

676
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I believe it's just the auto glass.

677
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:15,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to think might that could potentially be an and are we always there's things that could come up in the interim.

678
01:15:16,341 --> 01:15:24,243
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet that's a result of the most recent zoning change for any kind of auto repair facility now requires a special permit.

679
01:15:25,883 --> 01:15:28,904
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be by right in the zone and now it's a special permit.

680
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be going to you all and you are the special permit granting authority.

681
01:15:33,505 --> 01:15:37,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And fun fact, so I got in a minor little fender bender last week.

682
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got a list of auto repair facilities from my insurance agency and I was just,

683
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:53,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew we had a lot in Medford, but I was really shocked by the list of auto repair facilities in Medford, because it was all Middlesex County.

684
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:57,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, wow, Medford has a lot.

685
01:15:58,114 --> 01:15:59,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot.

686
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:04,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is just, this is technically an auto repair, but it's just glass repair.

687
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:09,898
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you have to make the decision whether

688
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:15,060
[SPEAKER_06]: they satisfy the criteria for a special permit?

689
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:18,405
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the use?

690
01:16:18,565 --> 01:16:21,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it outweigh the negatives of it?

691
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:21,069
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

692
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:26,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, thank you.

693
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's nothing else I'm going to ask for.

694
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:37,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, I guess I'm guessing the board will have like a brainstorming session next meeting.

695
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:43,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys want to just put it on the agenda to discuss potential zoning changes?

696
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:49,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can maybe narrow it or frame it to kind of direct.

697
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:49,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

698
01:16:49,929 --> 01:16:50,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you guys want.

699
01:16:51,609 --> 01:17:01,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get ideas from you now and not in six months, please.

700
01:17:01,152 --> 01:17:01,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm for it.

701
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:04,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we have to vote on it, but I'm for it.

702
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:11,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not for it tonight, but I would entertain it for next week, especially since it's a smaller agenda next week.

703
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:13,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

704
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:16,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it on the agenda next week.

705
01:17:17,187 --> 01:17:17,587
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?

706
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:19,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

707
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:23,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I will entertain a motion to adjourn.

708
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:30,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I so move.

709
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:34,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

710
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:40,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody has moved and somebody has seconded.

711
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:43,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

712
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:44,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman.

713
01:17:44,844 --> 01:17:45,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

714
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki?

715
01:17:48,071 --> 01:17:48,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

716
01:17:48,973 --> 01:17:49,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowles?

717
01:17:50,637 --> 01:17:50,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

718
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:52,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

719
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a yes.

720
01:17:54,325 --> 01:17:55,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

721
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:56,068
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week.

722
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:58,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

723
01:17:58,534 --> 01:17:59,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.
