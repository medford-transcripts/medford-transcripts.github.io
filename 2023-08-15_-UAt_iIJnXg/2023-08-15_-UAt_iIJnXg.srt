00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to turn it over.

44
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry, if you want to say a few words and we'll take a vote.

45

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent, for that.

47
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:35,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting to kind of get back into work, but the superintendent over in Chelsea knows the Medford superintendent, and they kind of got together.

48
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:42,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I live right on the Medford line.

49
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:43,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here

50
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,818
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same house I grew up in.

51
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:56,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did, you know, there's a, you know, a lot of big decisions coming up with the budget.

52
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:58,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of my area.

53
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, given the

54
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:20,997
[SPEAKER_01]: the vacancies that are coming up in important positions, I felt kind of obligated as a lifelong public servant to kind of step up and, you know, try to help the schoolchildren, you know, of Medford.

55
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:27,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jerry.

56

59
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:47,365
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciated the conversation we were able to have about the planning that's ahead of us as we think about rolling off of ESSER.

60
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely appreciated his

61
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:58,291
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point, which was enrollment projection, which is not something we've really ever talked about as a committee.

62
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important for us to start having that conversation.

63
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:05,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to welcome Jerry to the team, and I would make a motion to approve.

[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to someday to retiring myself.

71
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:42,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope nobody's calling me and asking me to raise my hand after I retire, but I greatly appreciate that you did.

00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to meeting you as well.
