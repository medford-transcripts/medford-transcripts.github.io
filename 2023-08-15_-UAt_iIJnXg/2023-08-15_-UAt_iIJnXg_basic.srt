We have a new business recommendation to approve the appointment of Mr. Gerald McHugh as the interim director of finance for the Metro Public Schools. And I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Maurice-Edward Benson.

5
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:26,698
Thank you. Good afternoon, school committee members. I'm very pleased to introduce Mr. Gerald McHugh. I enthusiastically recommend that the Medford School Committee vote to approve his appointment as interim finance director of the Medford Public Schools. Mr. McHugh comes to us with more than 40 years of extensive hands-on experience in the educational and municipal finance administration and operations.

6
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:53,916
Jerry McHugh retired from the Chelsea Public Schools in July of 2018 after almost 30 years of work as their executive director for administration and finance and school business manager. Since 2018, he has continued to work as a school finance consultant. His wealth of experience will be a great benefit to our district and community.

7
00:02:54,735 --> 00:03:23,063
During the interview process, Mr. McHugh impressed our team with his steadiness and experience. As a seasoned school finance professional, we're confident that he will complement and aid our central administrative team across a variety of relevant work areas, including accounting, revenue and expense forecasting, budget development, and financial data management and reporting.

8
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:45,128
Mr. McHugh earned his Bachelor of Science in Public Administration from Bentley College, Bentley University, and his Master of Science in Administrative Studies from Boston University. We are thrilled to welcome Jerry to Medford and know that his skills and experience will be major assets to the work of our team.

9
00:03:45,452 --> 00:04:14,684
Again, I present to you Mr. Gerald McHugh and I am asking the committee for approval of his appointment. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent. I know that member Graham and I also met Mr. McHugh when we had an informal interview meet and greet last week. So I just want to turn it over. Jerry, if you want to say a few words and we'll take a vote. Thank you.

10
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:43,507
Thank you, Madam Superintendent, for that. I wasn't expecting to kind of get back into work, but the superintendent over in Chelsea knows the Medford superintendent, and they kind of got together. And, you know, I live right on the Medford line. I've been here

11
00:04:44,616 --> 00:05:02,329
in the same house I grew up in. And I did, you know, there's a, you know, a lot of big decisions coming up with the budget. And that's kind of my area. And, you know, given the

12
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:28,643
the vacancies that are coming up in important positions, I felt kind of obligated as a lifelong public servant to kind of step up and, you know, try to help the schoolchildren, you know, of Medford. Thank you, Jerry. Member Graham?

13
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:51,869
Thank you. I had a chance to meet Jerry last week, the week before, two weeks ago, I guess. And I really appreciated the conversation we were able to have about the planning that's ahead of us as we think about rolling off of ESSER. And definitely appreciated his

14
00:05:51,869 --> 00:06:20,299
starting point, which was enrollment projection, which is not something we've really ever talked about as a committee. And I think it's really important for us to start having that conversation. So I'm excited to welcome Jerry to the team, and I would make a motion to approve. You're on mute, Mayor. Motion to approve by Member Graham. I'm going to address Member Rousseau, who has his hands up.

15
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:47,090
Thank you, Mayor. I'll second the motion, of course. And I wanna thank Jerry for, not volunteering, but for raising his hand. I look forward to someday to retiring myself. So I hope nobody's calling me and asking me to raise my hand after I retire, but I greatly appreciate that you did. I look forward to meeting you as well. And as I said, I second that motion.

16
00:06:48,746 --> 00:07:17,688
