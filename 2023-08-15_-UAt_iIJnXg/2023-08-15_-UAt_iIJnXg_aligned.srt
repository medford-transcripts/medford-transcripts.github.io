We have five present, two absent.

23
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,704
If we all can rise to salute the flag.

00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:41,147
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

25
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:53,593
We have a new business recommendation to approve the appointment of Mr. Gerald McHugh as the interim director of finance for the Metro Public Schools.

26
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,734
And I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Maurice-Edward Benson.

27
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:58,062
Thank you.

28
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,203
Good afternoon, school committee members.

29
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:04,166
I'm very pleased to introduce Mr. Gerald McHugh.

30
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:13,891
I enthusiastically recommend that the Medford School Committee vote to approve his appointment as interim finance director of the Medford Public Schools.

31
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:25,978
Mr. McHugh comes to us with more than 40 years of extensive hands-on experience in the educational and municipal finance administration and operations.

32
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:41,574
Jerry McHugh retired from the Chelsea Public Schools in July of 2018 after almost 30 years of work as their executive director for administration and finance and school business manager.

33
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:48,095
Since 2018, he has continued to work as a school finance consultant.

34
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,596
His wealth of experience will be a great benefit to our district and community.

35
00:02:54,815 --> 00:03:00,977
During the interview process, Mr. McHugh impressed our team with his steadiness and experience.

36
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:22,783
As a seasoned school finance professional, we're confident that he will complement and aid our central administrative team across a variety of relevant work areas, including accounting, revenue and expense forecasting, budget development, and financial data management and reporting.

37
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:35,377
Mr. McHugh earned his Bachelor of Science in Public Administration from Bentley College, Bentley University, and his Master of Science in Administrative Studies from Boston University.

38
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:44,527
We are thrilled to welcome Jerry to Medford and know that his skills and experience will be major assets to the work of our team.

39
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:54,956
Again, I present to you Mr. Gerald McHugh and I am asking the committee for approval of his appointment.

40
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:55,776
Thank you.

41
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,457
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

42
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:08,201
I know that member Graham and I also met Mr. McHugh when we had an informal interview meet and greet last week.

43
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,922
So I just want to turn it over.

44
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:13,924
Jerry, if you want to say a few words and we'll take a vote.

45
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Thank you.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,461
Thank you, Madam Superintendent, for that.

47
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:35,365
I wasn't expecting to kind of get back into work, but the superintendent over in Chelsea knows the Medford superintendent, and they kind of got together.

48
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:42,547
And, you know, I live right on the Medford line.

49
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:43,247
I've been here

50
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,818
in the same house I grew up in.

51
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:56,625
And I did, you know, there's a, you know, a lot of big decisions coming up with the budget.

52
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:58,866
And that's kind of my area.

53
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,669
And, you know, given the

54
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:20,997
the vacancies that are coming up in important positions, I felt kind of obligated as a lifelong public servant to kind of step up and, you know, try to help the schoolchildren, you know, of Medford.

55
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:27,522
Thank you, Jerry.

56
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:28,563
Member Graham?

57
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:30,548
Thank you.

58
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:37,195
I had a chance to meet Jerry last week, the week before, two weeks ago, I guess.

59
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:47,365
And I really appreciated the conversation we were able to have about the planning that's ahead of us as we think about rolling off of ESSER.

60
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,528
And definitely appreciated his

61
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:58,291
starting point, which was enrollment projection, which is not something we've really ever talked about as a committee.

62
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,652
And I think it's really important for us to start having that conversation.

63
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:05,994
So I'm excited to welcome Jerry to the team, and I would make a motion to approve.

64
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:12,856
You're on mute, Mayor.

65
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,558
Motion to approve by Member Graham.

66
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,099
I'm going to address Member Rousseau, who has his hands up.

67
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:21,814
Thank you, Mayor.

68
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,276
I'll second the motion, of course.

69
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:32,401
And I wanna thank Jerry for, not volunteering, but for raising his hand.

70
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,943
I look forward to someday to retiring myself.

71
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:42,907
So I hope nobody's calling me and asking me to raise my hand after I retire, but I greatly appreciate that you did.

72
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,869
I look forward to meeting you as well.

73
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,950
And as I said, I second that motion.

74
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,087
Thank you, Member Russo.

75
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,329
So there's a motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Russo.

76
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,791
If you could call the roll, please.

77
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:00,675

00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:02,176

Motion is approved.

89
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:23,864
Thank you for your willingness, Mr. McHugh, and we will see you soon, I'm sure.

90
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,185
Okay.

91
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:26,546

00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,507

00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,769
I'm looking forward to working with you.

100
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:56,552
