00:00:00,817 --> 00:00:06,942
[SPEAKER_11]: The public meeting of the City of Medford Liberal License Commission for November 26th will come to order.

2
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:09,625
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have an agenda to follow.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Darian, we don't have any minutes from the last briefing.

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:15,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make sure.

6
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:20,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you've been super busy all week with renewals and everything else.

7
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we'll get right into it.

8
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:29,658
[SPEAKER_11]: 1st item on the agenda is tough college for 1 day license to 1 day licenses.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually.

10
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,240
[SPEAKER_11]: You have anybody from task college?

11
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm here from tough scholars.

12
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:36,982
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tomorrow.

13
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:37,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenny.

14
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:41,984
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the 1st event we have starts at 6 o'clock.

15
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at 51 Winthrop Street, which is called Breed Hall.

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:55,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the Africana night, where we have a lot of members of the university gathering to celebrate.

17
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do have two bars set up.

18
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have Tufts police there.

19
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:10,534
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one entrance only, and they will be checking IDs and wristbanding at that table.

20
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else can I tell you?

21
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:19,663
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one at Breed Hall?

22
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:20,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

23
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:21,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

24
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:25,486
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

25
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:29,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And is that the thing you've been on?

26
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:30,088
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two of them.

27
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:30,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other one.

28
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,830
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first one.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,070
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Africana Night.

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,772
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done both of these events over multiple years.

31
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I see, the Fletcher School, okay.

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

33
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

34
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:49,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the other one from last year, but that's fine.

35
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:54,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Darren, do we have insurance on file with Tufts, correct?

36
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:54,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

37
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:55,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

38
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,920
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a sketch here.

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take a look.

40
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:06,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

41
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,606
[SPEAKER_13]: How's the new building working out?

42
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,646
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you?

43
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:10,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Cummins Building.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's great.

45
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:13,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it?

46
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

47
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:15,643
[SPEAKER_13]: What a beautiful venue.

48
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:16,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

49
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:25,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everything looks in order to me, Ben, Alan.

50
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:26,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I went through it last night, so I'm fine with it.

52
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:31,559
[SPEAKER_11]: They both look good.

53
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they actually both look good.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I kind of had noticed the same thing.

55
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:39,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have to make any notes after I reviewed it all last night.

56
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:44,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we're good as well, as long as you gentlemen would like to make a motion.

57
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:45,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure.

58
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll do both of them.

59
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:57,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I motion to approve the one-day license for Tufts, this one to be held at December 1st, Thursday.

60
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,287
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, from 6 to 9 p.m.

61
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,207
[SPEAKER_13]: December.

62
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:07,250
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, December 5th, uh, from 6 to 9 p.m.

63
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And then let me make someone out.

64
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,034
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the senior bingo.

65
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I motion to approve the one day license for Tufts.

66
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, this is also Thursday, December 5th.

67
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and this is for the senior bingo nine.

68
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:25,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

69
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second that motion.

70
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:28,720
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

71
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,900
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

72
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:30,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

73
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

74
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:31,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

75
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:32,422
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

76
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

77
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,146
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all set.

78
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:38,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

79
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:38,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.

80
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:39,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

81
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:40,288
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

82
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

83
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck with your events.

84
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:43,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

85
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:48,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you guys move over to the other side of the table so you don't have to keep turning around for the camera.

86
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,035
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be right facing it, you know?

87
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:51,136
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

88
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:52,197
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be easier, please.

89
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:53,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all set up.

90
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be here in about an hour.

91
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,060
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm all plugged in.

92
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:56,930
[SPEAKER_13]: mention.

93
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:57,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

94
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:59,412
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, cool.

95
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:03,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just so you can notice it was around.

96
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

97
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:08,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

98
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:17,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, next on the agenda, we have, uh, we have a representative for an American vehicle.

99
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

100
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I am here, how are you guys?

101
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:27,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, Brian, how are you?

102
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:27,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you, Brian.

103
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

104
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,592
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting our full CO, I believe today or tomorrow.

105
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the email from Scott last night, so just an update there.

106
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice, okay.

107
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us a little about the event, if you would, Brian.

108
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:47,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's the event at City Hall.

109
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We got asked to be the salesman of beer and wine.

110
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:58,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna set up two portable bars, just beer and wine.

111
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:02,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna have a nice, really, offering of IPAs and local craft beer.

112
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:07,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the mayor and, let's see right here,

113
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's the winter extravaganza from 4.30 to 6.30 on December 4th.

114
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:19,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

115
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:24,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Alan, did you?

116
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:28,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Brian, did you say beer and wine or all alcohol?

117
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:35,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We were planning on doing just beer and wine, but I was gonna ask you guys if you prefer we do everything or stick to the beer and wine.

118
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:40,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just looking, Mr. Chairman, I was looking at the applications, checked off all alcohol.

119
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I noticed that.

120
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:47,390
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not possible, Brian, unless you're a non-profit.

121
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Only non-profits can do all alcohol.

122
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that's fine.

123
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Beer and wine is what we're buying.

124
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:53,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just so you know.

125
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Outside your venue, you can't.

126
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:56,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

127
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:01,540
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was that, and what else did I have?

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see any insurance.

129
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Insurance liability.

130
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Liquor liability.

131
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Brian.

132
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,763
[SPEAKER_11]: For your company, you need to get a one-day spot that day.

133
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,364
[SPEAKER_11]: You know where it's off your premise.

134
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:13,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

135
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:15,125
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

136
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:23,969
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can get that out to Gary ASAP, hopefully sometime today or tomorrow, I'm sure you should be able to email it.

137
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:27,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Brian, would you be OK with Gary just making the correction on the application?

138
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

139
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:28,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

140
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:28,932
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

141
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:30,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that'd be great.

142
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:35,615
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I don't know if you're aware of it, but we have an online application

143
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:47,029
[SPEAKER_11]: and it'll be a lot more legible for us when we have to review it.

144
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:55,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing I just wanted to remind you of, I forgot to remind Tufts of as well, just keep in mind, you know, a week or two out,

145
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:05,369
[SPEAKER_11]: a few days ahead of time, and she's got to make an agenda, and sometimes it involves a weekend.

146
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,772
[SPEAKER_11]: So just give us a little leeway.

147
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:14,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this was kind of a, I know the situation here, but that's not a problem.

148
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in the future, you know?

149
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:16,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be great.

150
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, absolutely.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you.

152
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:20,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

153
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,364
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

154
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:23,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben, Helen?

155
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,247
[SPEAKER_06]: The diagram's there.

156
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, the setup looks good to me.

157
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from the insurance, I'm good and I can make a motion to approve this.

158
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

159
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to make a motion to approve the one-day license for the winter extravaganza as put forth by Brian with Grady-Hackendale.

160
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That is on December 4th, 2024 from 4.30 to 6.30 PM.

161
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,693
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make one adjustment to wine and malt.

162
00:07:55,077 --> 00:08:03,839
[SPEAKER_06]: and subject to them giving us their insurance for the one day.

163
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I second that motion.

164
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, all those in favor?

165
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,400
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

167
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

168
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:13,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passed.

169
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,222
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all set, Brian.

170
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:14,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck with that.

174
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:18,543
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

175
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,784

[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, we can see you, Susan.

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:42,379
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

180
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it's any great shakes, if you can.

181
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,183
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

182
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:54,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here for the executive director, Regina Parkinson, who had to be called away.

183
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have the applications.

184
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:57,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what's going on.

185
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,088
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

186
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us a little bit about the events.

187
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:02,370
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two events, correct?

188
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, yeah, there's two of them.

189
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:06,392
[SPEAKER_05]: One on December 12th.

190
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,393
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 to 11 PM, and it's going to be a concert.

191
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Open to the public, and we're expecting around 80 people, but it could be slightly less, slightly more.

192
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:24,075
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

193
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:33,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And the application says all alcohol, but as far as I know, we only expect to be serving beer and wine.

194
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:33,837
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

195
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:41,704
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that you are allowed to serve all alcohol where you are a non-profit, just for future reference.

196
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:41,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

197
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:42,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.

198
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:46,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's why she checked that box.

199
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:47,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's fine.

200
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We never know.

201
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

202
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:50,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

203
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty, and that was on the 12th for that one.

204
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,328
[SPEAKER_11]: That is on the 12th, yep.

205
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:03,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I noticed that there were two second pages on this election.

206
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:19,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know if the second one was a mistake, possibly should have been a sketch or an insurance certificate that may have been left out.

207
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I see the sketch on the second one.

208
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the same sketch.

209
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:23,561
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same sketch.

210
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we assume that.

211
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:38,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what about the insurance coverage for that day, for the two days?

212
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a quarter million dollar insurance from your insurance company for those two days.

213
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:46,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

214
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, they are on file.

215
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:54,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Daria has them, but I can send them along again if you want them.

216
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:54,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

217
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:55,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Daria will

218
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,893
[SPEAKER_11]: reach out to you if they're not on file, and if you can get them over to us, that'd be great.

219
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:03,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Just send it.

220
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:04,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just send it?

221
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just easier for me.

222
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:07,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just send it.

223
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:07,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

224
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:07,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Just send it.

225
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:12,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Gary is in the middle of all those renewals and stuff now.

226
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of hectic over here.

227
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no problem at all.

228
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:16,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

229
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:23,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, is there any other questions about the first event, or should I tell you about the second one?

230
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

231
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're fine with the first.

232
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:27,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Go right ahead.

233
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: What time is it?

234
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:35,388
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can go ahead and tell us about the second event.

235
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:35,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

236
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So the second event is probably going to be much smaller.

237
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually, I have a question for you, because we might want to shift the day of this, because there's a conflict with a board meeting the same night.

238
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some of the board members would like to go to the event.

239
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:57,579
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's currently scheduled for the 19th from 7 to 9 p.m.

240
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're estimating maybe 25 people, but this close to Christmas, it could be less because people have so many other things to do.

241
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's open and we will be serving beer and wine.

242
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:19,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an odd combination of watching a movie.

243
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the movie is When Harry Met Sally, if any of you want to come.

244
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:27,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And doing crochet.

245
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how this will work.

246
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a first for us.

247
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds like it should be fun at any rate.

248
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

249
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you say the 19?

250
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:38,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

251
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,313
[SPEAKER_13]: The application, this one says 12-12 also?

252
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,251
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the smaller one.

253
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:43,252
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

254
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:44,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

255
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:44,734
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

256
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:45,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

257
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:47,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

258
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:52,301
[SPEAKER_11]: On the file name, they both said twelve twelve.

259
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:52,722
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

260
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

261
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but the dates on the applications are correct.

262
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:58,968
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in Europe, but the.

263
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:00,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotcha.

264
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:06,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself, I don't have a problem with you changing the date, if need be, last minute.

265
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,164
[SPEAKER_11]: We're granting the license.

266
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:12,785
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to get back to Daria with an email that you did, in fact, change the date.

267
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And let her know what it is.

268
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:16,766
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a problem.

269
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:17,927
[SPEAKER_11]: We know what the setup is.

270
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,847
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where it's going to be.

271
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,788
[SPEAKER_11]: We know all the particulars.

272
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,108
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a problem granting the license.

273
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So that should be fine.

274
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:26,589
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

275
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:27,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

276
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:27,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

277
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:32,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm okay with the two of them.

278
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, no, it's pretty straightforward.

279
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get into questions now.

280
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:44,636
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so I'll motion to approve the one day license for 12-12-24 and 12-19-24.

281
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:44,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

282
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:45,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second.

283
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:46,937
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

284
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:47,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

285
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,979
[SPEAKER_13]: And just that they need to get insurance to us.

286
00:13:59,118 --> 00:13:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

287
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:00,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Just send it to us, Josh.

288
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Just resend it.

289
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

290
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,421
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

291
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:09,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

292
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:11,625
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all set for both days.

293
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:12,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks so much.

294
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

295
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:14,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

296
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:15,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

297
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, moving on.

298
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,939
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're doing next.

299
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,881
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a representative from Yoki here, please.

300
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:37,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Sylvia Guzman and the two prospective owners, Mr. Gu and Shelly.

301
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually didn't have any notes on this.

302
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:58,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I went through it the past couple of days and everything seems to be in order as far as I can see.

303
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:08,220
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I had a little issue with until I looked at it a little closer is on page nine.

304
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,281
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in a different language and it's from the Department of Unemployment Assistance.

305
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:44,375
[SPEAKER_11]: uh the only thing that's in english is says important notice this document contains important information please have it translated immediately i'm assuming it's with the other dua um form that's right above it is that the case or is it something important that we should know about no that's part of the certificate of compliance that was provided to us and i think that's the um

306
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,907
[SPEAKER_01]: The the form that issued with the state.

307
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,008
[SPEAKER_01]: For the state.

308
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:57,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I was assuming that, but I just wanted to double check.

309
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you did a great job.

310
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:06,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are within the, as far as I can say, and all of the paperwork, unless my fellow commissioners has any.

311
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:08,852

00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:10,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

486
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, moving on.

487
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:19,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the only thing that is left is the hearing, correct?

488
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:19,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

489
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:24,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's close this up.

490
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:48,551
[SPEAKER_11]: The folks outside, are they for the hearing, correct?

491
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:48,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

492
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:50,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

493
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:51,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Call them in.

494
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Let them know we're ready for them.

495
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:57,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

496
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:59,054

[SPEAKER_11]: Before I review the procedural matters, I'd like to introduce the members of the City of Medford License Commission.

00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,782

[SPEAKER_11]: And one of my fellow commissioners is Alan Matarana.

504
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,890
[SPEAKER_11]: My other fellow commissioner is Ben O'Sullivan,

505
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:28,046
[SPEAKER_11]: and our licensed commission secretary is Darian Tierra.

506
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:42,236
[SPEAKER_11]: The procedural matters that we have, what we're gonna follow here today is I'm going to begin by calling the first alleged violation on the Metro Police report.

507
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:50,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will then ask who is present on behalf of the Metro Police Department

508
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:09,375
[SPEAKER_11]: on behalf of the licensee, and whether there are any other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify, and I will then swear in all parties.

509
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:14,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I will use the same format for the second and third alleged violations.

510
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:31,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, the first of three alleged violations in the police report will be read into the record by Medford Police, who may also present any evidence pertaining to the alleged violation.

511
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:41,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Following the Medford Police, the licensee or their representative will have the opportunity to make a brief statement.

512
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:49,945
[SPEAKER_11]: followed by another individual, followed by other individuals with firsthand knowledge of the alleged to testify.

513
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:58,246
[SPEAKER_11]: The commissioners and chairs and chair will also have the opportunity to ask questions at that time.

514
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:04,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to then move on to the second violation following the same format.

515
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,283
[SPEAKER_11]: as the first violation.

516
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:12,487
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, the third alleged violation following the same format as the first and second violations.

517
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:22,475
[SPEAKER_11]: All this testimony will be limited to only those individuals with firsthand personal knowledge of the alleged incident.

518
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:30,721
[SPEAKER_11]: The three separate incidents are all for the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age.

519
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,945
[SPEAKER_11]: a violation of Massachusetts general law chapter 138, section 34.

520
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:47,010
[SPEAKER_11]: After the three alleged violations have been heard, we will take a short recess for the commissioners to deliberate.

521
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,892
[SPEAKER_11]: The commission will return to room 207 without finding.

522
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:57,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see.

523
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:21,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have one of my papers here.

524
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:50,497
Okay.

525
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,660
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.

526
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,723
[SPEAKER_11]: The first thing I'm going to do is call for the Metro Police to read the first alleged violation.

527
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Officer Smith, Lieutenant Lockowitz,

528
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:13,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Either one of you gentlemen, do you have the report with you?

529
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the report with me.

530
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

531
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:19,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Wherever you like, Officer Smith.

532
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:26,790
[SPEAKER_11]: You can sit over there next to Ben so you can be in front of the camera.

533
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:34,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the first violation, Officer Smith, until, yeah, just the first violation.

534
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:35,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

535
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:39,198
[SPEAKER_08]: So the conditions that we have in the first violation involves a juvenile.

536
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:45,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I will not be using the juveniles name or address or any identifying information.

537
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,085
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, state of our department policy.

538
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:52,206
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, you referred to as the juvenile as the juvenile.

539
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:55,287
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, officer, this is June 24th.

540
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one on your report.

541
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:03,490
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, I. I did from November 1st, November 1st.

542
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,930
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, when we get from this office.

543
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,090
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

544
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want me to continue from November 1st?

545
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:10,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

546
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:15,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So, obviously, my name is Patrick Smith.

547
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:16,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a police officer in the City of Manhattan.

548
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:24,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a police officer for 12 years, and I've been an agent for a method like a licensing commission for approximately a year.

549
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:32,183
[SPEAKER_08]: On November 1st, I received an email from Sergeant Christoph Camino from the Metropolitan Police Department.

550
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That evening, he was the Eastside Sergeant.

551
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,563
[SPEAKER_08]: He was in a mocked vehicle.

552
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,125
[SPEAKER_08]: He was wearing a uniform and patrolling the city.

553
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:45,269
[SPEAKER_08]: The following email, I've redacted the juvenile's information.

554
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:50,673
[SPEAKER_08]: There is specific information to the juvenile in the email, but for the purposes of this hearing, I'm going to redact it.

555
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:54,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It states, Officer Smith, while on patrol, I noticed the vehicle.

556
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:57,998
[SPEAKER_08]: We then provided a Massachusetts registration plate.

557
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:01,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Pots idling on River Street next to Method Wine and Spirits.

558
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:06,500
[SPEAKER_08]: The two occupants appear to be approximately 16 to 18 years old.

559
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:11,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The car comes back to an adult male out of, that provides the address.

560
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:17,008
[SPEAKER_08]: He ran the address and was able to locate the juvenile.

561
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:20,410
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time I circled the block, the car was gone.

562
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:28,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I showed the clerk the picture of the juvenile from CJIS, and he verified the juvenile did buy alcohol in the store.

563
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,093
[SPEAKER_08]: The court claimed the juvenile had a valid ID.

564
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:35,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you can use this to look into the business further.

565
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:41,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to be common knowledge among underage persons that they can purchase alcohol from the store.

566
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Very respectfully, Sergeant Christopher Cacavino, Memphis Police Department.

567
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:51,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the email that I received from Sergeant Cacavino on November 4th.

568
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:55,287
[SPEAKER_11]: And you continue on to on November 5th?

569
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:55,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

570
00:27:57,325 --> 00:28:03,928
[SPEAKER_08]: So on November 5th, 2024, I traveled to the juvenile's residence and spoke with the juvenile and the juvenile's mother.

571
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:08,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Juvenile's mother's information is on file with the Medford Police Department.

572
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile was positively identified as 17 years old.

573
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:16,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I explained to the juvenile and the juvenile's mother the reason for my presence.

574
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:24,456
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile admitted to purchasing a bottle of Dawn Julio tequila from Medford Wine and Spirits located at 35 Sales Street Method

575
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:37,117
[SPEAKER_08]: On Friday, November 1st, 2024, according to the juvenile, they presented the, according to the state of New Hampshire's driver's license, which identified the juvenile as 22 years of age.

576
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:42,219
[SPEAKER_08]: After presenting the state of New Hampshire driver's license, the juvenile was able to purchase the liquor.

577
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,041
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile then handed me a New Hampshire driver's license that he or she used to purchase the liquor.

578
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:53,143
[SPEAKER_08]: New Hampshire driver's license was clearly a fraudulent,

579
00:28:54,143 --> 00:29:00,090
[SPEAKER_08]: The license cod stock was abnormally thick, the ID's lamination was peeling, and the overall color of the license was off.

580
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,875
[SPEAKER_08]: The query of the license number resulted in no record in the New Hampshire R&D.

581
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I explained to the juvenile, the juvenile's mother that the fraudulent driver's license would be seized.

582
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile stated that the fake New Hampshire driver's license was purchased over the internet.

583
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:24,782
[SPEAKER_08]: We then had a conversation about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications of purchasing and possessing liquor by persons under the age of 21.

584
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:29,425
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile was remorseful for their actions, and I believe the interaction was positive.

585
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,628
[SPEAKER_08]: No criminal charges were filed against the juvenile.

586
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'd like to kind of skip ahead.

587
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:40,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in relation to the first offense, but everything's kind of in order.

588
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to view video footage of the incident.

589
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:57,483
[SPEAKER_08]: In relation to the incident that took place on November 1st, the juvenile did purchase liquor inside of Metro Wine and Spirits.

590
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:08,031
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile purchased a 12-pack of Poor's Light beer, a 6-pack of Tooties by Southwest, and a small bottle of liquor.

591
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:13,555
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile did not present an ID during that purchase on November 1st.

592
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:25,371
[SPEAKER_08]: The juvenile actually purchased a bottle of Don Julio the following day, on November 2nd, in which he presented the fake New Hampshire's driver's license.

593
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:31,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the juvenile was confused as dates, I believe.

594
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I'd also like to submit the commission would like

595
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:39,444
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to have to drive a license.

596
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:40,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we looked at it.

597
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:46,129
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to just ask that juveniles name on this is the juveniles name and we don't repeat that a lot.

598
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:46,849
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

599
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:47,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

600
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:26,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already showed you that.

601
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:29,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Last question.

602
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:35,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So did he provide that the second time he purchased the order, the time he made a notice?

603
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:41,212
[SPEAKER_08]: From the videos that I saw, the first purchase, which was the November 1st one, the Passage and Observe.

604
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:42,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

605
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,514
[SPEAKER_08]: It was no IP presented during that purchase.

606
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:44,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

607
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:50,159
[SPEAKER_08]: The following day, the Ball of Dawn Booyah was purchased and this IP was presented.

608
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:51,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the November 2nd.

609
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,861
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the November 2nd.

610
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:53,462
[SPEAKER_13]: That was presented.

611
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:53,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

612
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Officer Smith, you were

613
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:36,380
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd like to continue to read where you left off.

614
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:43,045
[SPEAKER_08]: In between the two allegations of how we got to a break or just go right to two?

615
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:46,007
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're not going to go right to two yet.

616
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have you read that separate.

617
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,570
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where it starts on page two.

618
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:56,873
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one, two, third paragraph where it says on Friday, November 8th.

619
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,615
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to read that right now.

620
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's read everything up to that.

621
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:06,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And that'll finish violation one, alleged violation one, I'm sorry.

622
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:14,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And if anything else also in the summary that you feel is relevant to alleged violation one, it'd be great.

623
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So after leaving the juvenile residence, I contacted the Metro Police State Resource Officer, Robert Pascantelli.

624
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:29,221
[SPEAKER_08]: According to Officer Pascantelli, Method One experience is well known among high school students as a liquor store that sells underage persons.

625
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Officer Pascantelli is aware of this information from direct conversations with students of Method High School.

626
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:38,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I advised Officer Pascantelli of my interaction with the juvenile.

627
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:43,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I then contacted Lieutenant Walkowicz and advised him of my investigation into Sergeant Camino's email.

628
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:46,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Lieutenant Walkowicz spoke with Captain Camino

629
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:50,586
[SPEAKER_08]: an authorization was granted to investigate the purchasing of liquor by persons under the age of 21.

630
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:52,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

631
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,887
[SPEAKER_08]: That's essentially the summary for our bylaw.

632
00:33:55,647 --> 00:34:06,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, before we go in to this any further, I'd like to swear everybody in that's going to be testifying or speaking today.

633
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:15,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoever's going to be testifying or speaking, please raise your right hand.

634
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:19,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.

635
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:22,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

636
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:23,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

637
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I was shuffling one of your papers around.

638
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:28,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

639
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:38,690
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point in time, we're going to give the licensee, Mr. Patel, an opportunity to speak.

640
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Either you can speak, the clerk can speak.

641
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,493
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a representative, you're welcome to speak at this time.

642
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:53,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to explain the situation because he doesn't speak clear English.

643
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: He does speak English, but I'm the owner of Metro Alliance.

644
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:58,968
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my brother, Kiran Patel.

645
00:34:59,388 --> 00:34:59,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

646
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:08,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our system, we cannot check the same ID information within the 24 hour period.

647
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So we check the individual impression, the ID on October 31st, the day prior,

648
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:27,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And so on November 1st, he wouldn't allow us to enter the same ID information, but then the second day, November 2nd, when he came back, we also asked for his ID and entered the information.

649
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:31,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And so at first, like prior to this incident, we had a

650
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:39,295
[SPEAKER_07]: register in built ID tech system, which is not sometimes accurate.

651
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:43,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And for reference, I have a screenshot of the system.

652
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So in one system, we would say the ID is okay, but we got a newer system now.

653
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,703
[SPEAKER_07]: that runs through the DMV that says the ID is false.

654
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:58,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, there is no one system that works perfectly.

655
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:04,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like one system consistently catches the fake ID over the other.

656
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:10,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes one system will catch, the other system will fail, and sometimes one system will catch, the other system will fail.

657
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:14,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason being sometimes these fake IDs are so,

658
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:31,531
[SPEAKER_07]: created perfectly, the barcode or the information sometimes will go through the DMV, but there is no system in the market that will give us like, let's say you have a driver license on your DMV, what your profile picture is, like that's not going to give to us.

659
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:33,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we were to create a fake

660
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:39,249
[SPEAKER_07]: license creating your information with my picture.

661
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:45,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It will still pass through the system, but it will make it harder to get the driver's license.

662
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the reference between the two systems.

663
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,193
[SPEAKER_07]: One will say, OK.

664
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:54,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Other is going to say, not related to the DMV.

665
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:54,955
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

666
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, sir, you mentioned that you are the owner.

667
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:58,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you?

668
00:36:58,957 --> 00:37:01,778
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Vatsal Patel.

669
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:02,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, your first name?

670
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:03,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Vatsal.

671
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:09,478
[SPEAKER_11]: A-T-S-A-L.

672
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,080
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

673
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

674
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And this gentleman is?

675
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:15,004
[SPEAKER_07]: He's my brother.

676
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:22,974
[SPEAKER_07]: He helps run the store and he's the first-hand witness to the events.

677
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:23,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

678
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:27,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do you spell your name, sir?

679
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,135
[SPEAKER_11]: K-I-R-A-N.

680
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:30,976
[SPEAKER_11]: K-I-R-A-N.

681
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:31,917
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

682
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:35,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So neither one of you gentlemen are the clerk that was in the store that day?

683
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Rakesh.

684
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Rakesh.

685
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:38,501
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

686
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:40,543
OK.

687
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And you mentioned the scan.

688
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:46,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you're upgrading to the ID buys a smart V2 ID scanner.

689
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:47,387
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you have in there now?

690
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:47,447
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

691
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:59,933
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same night, when officer Smith called me, at the same night, we ordered a new system to verify more accuracy.

692
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:05,954
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we're more confused than ever, because now one will say it passed, the other system doesn't pass.

693
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:08,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, it's not like one system got it.

694
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to mention one more thing.

695
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:20,457
[SPEAKER_02]: With the junior board, what officer Smith said about the board don't fool you, he said, I believe, on November 1st.

696
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:27,392
[SPEAKER_02]: He was born on November 2nd, and that time he showed the ID, the New Hampshire ID.

697
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:33,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The video officers didn't show on November 1st, he didn't present the ID.

698
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:40,856
[SPEAKER_02]: But October 31st, he came and we verified that time, his date of birth, all the information.

699
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:46,158
[SPEAKER_02]: They telling me like fluent, without any hesitation, they verified those information.

700
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:50,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we was believing like those IDs like real.

701
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:53,755
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was November 1st.

702
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, October 31st also he presents the same thing.

703
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:10,805
[SPEAKER_11]: What I don't understand is, um, you, when you were explaining about the machine, the ID machine, you said that you started out with, um, the 31st of October.

704
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:26,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But this incident was the first, so you're trying to, the way I understand it is you're trying to tell me if you put an ID in this machine, it doesn't instantly tell you that this is fraudulent or not?

705
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So it does, right?

706
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:30,594
[SPEAKER_07]: If it passes, right?

707
00:39:30,755 --> 00:39:38,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even if it doesn't pass, it's like once we enter the ID information into the system, we cannot enter the same ID information for 24 hours.

708
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason being, they charge us $1.50,

709
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:45,206
[SPEAKER_07]: to verify the ID information.

710
00:39:45,547 --> 00:39:48,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a built-in protection that we don't like.

711
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:52,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we scan one SAM ID five times, they don't charge us five times.

712
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:54,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only scanned one time.

713
00:39:54,472 --> 00:40:00,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the reason, yeah, it's a 0.4 hours window period that we can enter their ID information.

714
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:01,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

715
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:06,238
[SPEAKER_11]: So why didn't it work on November 1st when you scanned it?

716
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:20,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the alleged juvenile in there the day before they could have purchased something, and maybe you wouldn't have seen it the following day.

717
00:40:20,695 --> 00:40:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to figure out why it's, you know, why this... So prior to November 1st, we only had one system in place.

718
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have two systems.

719
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: We purchased the same night when we talked with Officer Smith.

720
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:36,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The same night we purchased the new system.

721
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:42,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So the newest system can you scan it as often as you like, say the same person comes in

722
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,692
[SPEAKER_11]: two times, three times a day, and a different clerk is working, obviously.

723
00:40:57,712 --> 00:40:57,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

724
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:02,335
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know that the person was in earlier and showed a positive ID.

725
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:02,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

726
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:03,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

727
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So this new system can do that.

728
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:05,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

729
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:06,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

730
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:06,997
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

731
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And you got that on the first.

732
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:13,600
[SPEAKER_11]: You got that new system on November 1st.

733
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

734
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:17,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already all day in the store.

735
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:22,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the system arrived, then we set it up the same day.

736
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:33,581
[SPEAKER_02]: On November 10th, with the new system and old system, we got four more fake IDs that I reported to the officer Smith at the same night with the email.

737
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some, because once you take the ID and see size, the people, they're getting mad, you know, like the customer, they want those IDs back.

738
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:47,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the customers, we have a little hard argument.

739
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:49,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So that time I called 911 from the Lawrence.

740
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:55,094
[SPEAKER_02]: to get some assistance over here, but nobody show up after that.

741
00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:57,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I talk already officers meet.

742
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:08,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes the violence can create because those customer, once you take those ID, they're getting mad, you know, they need that ID because they don't want to share the information also.

743
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,208
[SPEAKER_13]: So help me understand.

744
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:19,255
[SPEAKER_13]: So on November 1st, no license was asked for, but on November 2nd, a license was asked for at the purchase

745
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that's October 31st as well also.

746
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:33,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just, your education is you guys are bringing to light that on October 31st the same kid came in in Bottlicker gave that fake ID.

747
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:34,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

748
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you checked it that time it passed.

749
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:37,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

750
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:41,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they come in the next day because it's within 24 hours.

751
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:43,587
[SPEAKER_06]: You did not check it on the next day.

752
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when he bought done.

753
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:50,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he bought beer that day.

754
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he comes in the next day.

755
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:56,257
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on a roll, comes back in and then presents it on the next day.

756
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:59,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got on the, on the second and then he presents it to them.

757
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, that, that idea that when we passed around,

758
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:05,873
[SPEAKER_06]: But it passed that ID?

759
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:07,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the first time you scanned it.

760
00:43:07,994 --> 00:43:13,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So we ordered it on the 1st of November, but we didn't get it like a few days after that.

761
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:17,019
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the 31st when you first gave it to you, it passed the system?

762
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,839
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was on the old system.

763
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:38,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you spoke to him, he admitted to one time that we probably was going three days in a row.

764
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:40,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he got confused.

765
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:41,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

766
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:47,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what day was that new system actually up and running?

767
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:03,464
[SPEAKER_12]: This one, not really.

768
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:05,905
[SPEAKER_02]: November 10.

769
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:07,125
[SPEAKER_02]: November 10.

770
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,146
[SPEAKER_02]: On the morning, yeah.

771
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:09,787
[SPEAKER_02]: The system will start working.

772
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:10,447
[SPEAKER_02]: What system?

773
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,929
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's your policy on carding people?

774
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:20,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I go places, and I think I can say that person's not of age.

775
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:23,112
[SPEAKER_13]: That person's not of age.

776
00:44:23,152 --> 00:44:24,953
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your store policy if you

777
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:27,592
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, everybody up to 33 years old.

778
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:29,073
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your policy?

779
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:31,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, everybody, everybody.

780
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:34,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have a doubt, you card everybody.

781
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:34,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

782
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:48,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when we have inspection, like I submitted the Mystic Way inspection, they came, that person was like almost 35, and we still ask the ID and they give your certificate for the asking ID.

783
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:51,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I submitted to the Daria.

784
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Daria?

785
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:51,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

786
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:52,167
[SPEAKER_02]: The tips?

787
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:52,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

788
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:08,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything else you'd like to say on behalf of this first violation that we're speaking about?

789
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:15,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Was this that you were showing me?

790
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this an example of a fake ID?

791
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:18,469
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a fake ID, yeah.

792
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:23,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a reference to that your pass is in one system but fails in the other system.

793
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are constantly getting more and more ideas.

794
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:08,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this DMV check, is that for all DMVs or just Massachusetts?

795
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:13,266
[SPEAKER_07]: No, 40 plus allows us to run through their DMV.

796
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:31,871
[SPEAKER_12]: May I ask one question?

797
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:32,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

798
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:47,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we met on November 9th, you told me you and Rakesh downloaded an app to your iPad, and that was the app that you were going to use to check IDs until the new system.

799
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,052
[SPEAKER_08]: The new system is a very late system from what I've heard.

800
00:46:52,612 --> 00:47:02,295
[SPEAKER_08]: But you told me that between our phone call on November 8th and when we met on November 9th, you and Rakesh both downloaded an app to your phone.

801
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:07,638
[SPEAKER_08]: use until the new system arrived.

802
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:13,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So what system did you use on October 31st?

803
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:16,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a built-in register.

804
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that's three systems.

805
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So the former one was temporary.

806
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:19,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we just have two.

807
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: One is built-in register and one is the newer one.

808
00:47:34,492 --> 00:47:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: The phone app was just a temporary solution.

809
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:39,956
[SPEAKER_07]: But that wasn't reliable either.

810
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:43,158
[SPEAKER_07]: That still passes the IDs sometimes.

811
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:47,201
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a system in place on October 31st.

812
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:50,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You had all these people coming in.

813
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wasn't sophisticated enough.

814
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:53,025
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

815
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:57,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all of these, from this picture, I see that picture, that's all from the new system.

816
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:58,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all brand new.

817
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:58,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

818
00:47:58,669 --> 00:47:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the HD one.

819
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the HD smartphone.

820
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:05,506
[SPEAKER_02]: just a general question to that.

821
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:07,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many other liquor stores?

822
00:48:07,707 --> 00:48:09,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have that same system?

823
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:11,249
[SPEAKER_02]: You own other liquor stores, right?

824
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:11,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

825
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:12,470
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of advice.

826
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one other one.

827
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:34,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

828
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:35,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

829
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:48,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, not to get into No, we ordered the new system because we in our experience this system is better than other but like I said, it's not 100% guaranteed.

830
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:55,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sometime our QoS system will catch a fake ID and it'll pass through this system because it's how they process

831
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:58,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this goes to the VM view.

832
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, if I create a fake ID with the barcode, right?

833
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,521
[SPEAKER_07]: With genuine barcode, with another identifier.

834
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say we are talking about us two, right?

835
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:19,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I create a fake ID that has my picture for all of your information, including the barcode, that will pass to the new system.

836
00:49:20,484 --> 00:49:25,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there is no system anywhere on the market that gives us

837
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,781
[SPEAKER_07]: what the picture is on the DMV profile, right?

838
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we can compare.

839
00:49:34,022 --> 00:49:34,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

840
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there facial recognition software?

841
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:38,183
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there isn't.

842
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:39,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the dilemma.

843
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:42,104
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

844
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:45,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just explaining what the loophole is.

845
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

846
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:47,046
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

847
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:47,286
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

848
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:50,587
[SPEAKER_07]: But we believe it to be better because it goes through the DMV.

849
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,047
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes, yeah.

850
00:49:52,807 --> 00:49:55,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends how they create the fake IDs.

851
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:57,147
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yeah.

852
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:04,771
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, are there any other questions from anyone pertaining to alleged violation one?

853
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:13,916
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, just for reference, that idea that was passed around that that's also true about a month, which is right.

854
00:50:13,936 --> 00:50:15,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke at the photo, right?

855
00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:16,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

856
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:16,317
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

857
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:21,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

858
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:27,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And they know, you said you already spoken to their parents, they didn't purchase these gentlemen were

859
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,330
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very good.

860
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:37,855
[SPEAKER_08]: The following weekend, I did receive a phone call from Mr. Bedell that they had seized some licenses.

861
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:43,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went in and took possession of them.

862
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:48,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I also want to speak to that one time where he said he contacted the Metro Police and we didn't show up.

863
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:50,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke to that officer.

864
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:53,867
[SPEAKER_08]: When he responded, there were no juveniles inside the store, so we continued on.

865
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:57,592
[SPEAKER_08]: He did not go into the business and speak to Mr. Kesh Patel.

866
00:50:58,012 --> 00:51:03,820
[SPEAKER_08]: He did respond, looked inside, there were no juveniles inside causing any kind of disturbance, and they continued on to the judges.

867
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,810
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.

868
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:14,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, at this point, why don't we move on to the we've taken our notes and we're going to move on to the second alleged violation.

869
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:25,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Officer Smith, if you care to read it from on the second violation, beginning it on Friday, November 8th, twenty twenty four in her report.

870
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:25,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

871
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:34,253
[SPEAKER_08]: On Friday, November 8th, twenty twenty four, I traveled to multiple licensed liquor establishments within the city of Method and observed how business was being conducted.

872
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:40,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I wore a full Method police uniform, wearing the same thing that I wore that night, and I was in an unmarked Method police vehicle.

873
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,378
[SPEAKER_08]: This started about 7.30 p.m.

874
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:49,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to the station about 7.30, got in the car, and then just started going up and driving around.

875
00:51:51,182 --> 00:52:00,849
[SPEAKER_08]: At eight o'clock, I parked on the corner of Salem Street, River Street, and I'm serving Method blind and spirits, located at 45 Salem Street, at approximately 8.10 p.m.

876
00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:07,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I observed a tan in color Toyota Camry turn from Salem Street onto River Street.

877
00:52:08,214 --> 00:52:11,477
[SPEAKER_08]: The vehicle appeared to be occupied by five teenagers.

878
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:14,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Camry parked in the parking lot behind them and wanted spirits.

879
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,622
[SPEAKER_08]: A male exited the driver's seat.

880
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Based on the male's physical characteristics, he appeared to be under the age of 18.

881
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: The male proceeded to enter and measure wine and spirits.

882
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:29,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Moments later, the male exited the store carrying two 12-packs and a nickel of ultra-alcoholic beer.

883
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I approached the male and asked him how old he was.

884
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,714
[SPEAKER_08]: He responded by stating at 19.

885
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:40,360
[SPEAKER_08]: When asked how he was able to purchase the beer, the male explained he showed the clerk a picture ID on his phone.

886
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,391
[SPEAKER_08]: male was subsequently positively identified.

887
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:45,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want me to dig up his information or do I just say it?

888
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's fine.

889
00:52:46,274 --> 00:52:47,294
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dig that up.

890
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:50,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the male was positively identified as Michael Bailey.

891
00:52:50,557 --> 00:52:53,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Date of birth is December 24th, 2005.

892
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,701
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, in fact, 19 years old.

893
00:52:56,481 --> 00:53:03,346
[SPEAKER_08]: After conversing with Mr. Bailey, he presented me with a fraudulent Massachusetts driver's license that identified himself as 23 years of age.

894
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:08,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Bailey explained he used the fraudulent Massachusetts driver's license to purchase the beer.

895
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,632
[SPEAKER_08]: The Massachusetts driver's license

896
00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:20,354
[SPEAKER_08]: fraudulence, a photograph of the license was blurry and a hologram of the center was missing, where the license number resulted in no record in the Massachusetts R&D.

897
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:26,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I then spoke with the passengers of Mr. Daley's vehicle and identified them as all, they were all high school students, all five years old.

898
00:53:26,635 --> 00:53:36,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Daley was advised about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications for purchasing slash possessing liquor by persons under the age of 21.

899
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:41,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Bailey was remorseful for his actions, and I believe our interaction was positive.

900
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:46,726
[SPEAKER_08]: The two 12-packs and nickel of ultra and the fake driver's license were seized.

901
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:49,589
[SPEAKER_08]: No criminal charges were filed against Mr. Bailey.

902
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:53,353
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like also to submit Mr. Bailey's fake ID that he used that evening.

903
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:11,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I was curious about this license, because when I read the report, it said it was blurry, and all of a sudden it was missing.

904
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And this went through the machine?

905
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,723
[SPEAKER_12]: It was in the machine room, yes.

906
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:55,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Smith, did this individual say when he was calling or not?

907
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:57,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that come out in conversation?

908
00:54:57,485 --> 00:55:01,827
[SPEAKER_08]: He initially told me that he used a photo of his ID on his phone.

909
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:04,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he started scrolling through his phone.

910
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:07,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, you know, did you use an ID or not?

911
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:09,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he came up with the ID on his phone.

912
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:10,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said he wanted a cop.

913
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:11,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

914
00:55:11,813 --> 00:55:11,973
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

915
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only time.

916
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:26,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you allow, if someone has a picture of their ID on their iPhone, would you allow that?

917
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,046
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, physical ID.

918
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:35,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And another thing, we follow strict procedure, where like if, let's say five of them were to come into the store, we would ID all five.

919
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:36,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

920
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:39,671
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they swiped up and they only send one person in.

921
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:47,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like we're trying best on our side to do it, but like if you are to come further down the road, we don't know how many hours in the,

922
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:53,358
[SPEAKER_07]: We do the best we can to see, but we can only go so far.

923
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:53,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

924
00:55:53,538 --> 00:55:54,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show some of them.

925
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:57,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Hologram is the one we can catch it by.

926
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:58,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure.

927
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:00,824
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't done the alpha pilot with this one.

928
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:01,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Just holding on.

929
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:02,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a start.

930
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's wrong.

931
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:24,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

932
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

933
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

934
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

935
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:33,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

936
00:56:33,374 --> 00:56:35,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

937
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:36,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

938
00:56:36,196 --> 00:56:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

939
00:56:37,737 --> 00:56:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

940
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:39,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

941
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

942
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

943
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

944
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:45,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

945
00:56:45,723 --> 00:56:46,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

946
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:47,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this time?

947
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Patel, would you care to comment at this

948
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:55,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, within your system, we will be able to test that license.

949
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:56,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

950
00:56:57,555 --> 00:57:01,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So the new system wouldn't pick that up as a fight or flight date?

951
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:01,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

952
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:01,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

953
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

954
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:05,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Gentlemen.

955
00:57:05,382 --> 00:57:08,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, currently individuals, that's always been your policy?

956
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

957
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The day you open the doors.

958
00:57:11,868 --> 00:57:15,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did have an incident in... Was it an incident?

959
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, but after the first thing, some of the like stricter all the policies.

960
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:29,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Alan, Ben, like you care to comment?

961
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, thanks.

962
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:42,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, and I'm just trying to remind, does tips cover, like, how to evaluate IDs?

963
00:57:42,748 --> 00:57:48,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if I could see that again, I was looking for something and I want to see where it's on mine.

964
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:49,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see it on that.

965
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:52,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I did see this hologram family in the center.

966
00:57:52,990 --> 00:58:02,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, as a layperson, seeing it, I wouldn't obviously know right away, like I'm thinking of somebody handing me it, but I think you do.

967
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: handle them all.

968
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:08,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Now looking at my idea clearly, I can see that.

969
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Now did you gentlemen take the TIP certification?

970
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:14,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

971
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure they went over

972
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,768
[SPEAKER_11]: how to check for an ID, whether they're valid or not.

973
00:58:21,028 --> 00:58:21,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

974
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:22,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do our best.

975
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:26,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rakesh Patel, so he's a little bit older, he wears glasses.

976
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:30,750
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes it's hard for him to see the hologram and whatnot.

977
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,751
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, if that, I'd even pass the UV test, but not, like, I don't know.

978
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:44,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the only reason why is shortly after the compliance checks, as Sudeep mentioned,

979
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:52,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I, Sophie had offered tip certification free of charge for on-premise and off-premise.

980
00:58:53,734 --> 00:59:03,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And I took the tips certification and part of it was saying, you know, telling you just quick tricks if something's valid or not.

981
00:59:03,515 --> 00:59:11,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked on yours, not yours, Mr. Bailey's, and I couldn't remember

982
00:59:13,089 --> 00:59:15,910
[SPEAKER_11]: what one of the tricks were until I just checked mine.

983
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:28,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And where the hologram is, below the hologram, it should have the person's first initial, first name initial, last name initial, and the year they were born.

984
00:59:29,096 --> 00:59:30,397
[SPEAKER_11]: On mine, it's RD55.

985
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:31,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm old.

986
00:59:32,078 --> 00:59:34,479
[SPEAKER_11]: But this has nothing like that.

987
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:39,561
[SPEAKER_11]: You can barely see the hologram, and it's not there.

988
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,262
[SPEAKER_11]: The initials and the date of birth

989
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:57,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, I mean, that's for me, somebody that never checks IDs, that's, you know, it's kind of like, okay, well, I know that, but for you guys to check them, if you're in doubt at all, just put your phone on and look and say, okay, it's not showing through.

990
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:58,561
[SPEAKER_11]: This is okay.

991
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:05,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty, pretty cut and dry, but this is pretty obvious that it's not a real ID.

992
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:10,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but anyways, that's great.

993
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:15,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry I didn't interrupt, but we just wanted to get that screen away.

994
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:24,707
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so anything else you gentlemen would like to say in regards to LH violation too?

995
01:00:25,868 --> 01:00:26,048
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

996
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:26,928
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

997
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:29,889
[SPEAKER_11]: My fellow commissioners, Alan, Ben, anything?

998
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:33,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other comments on LH violation?

999
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:38,733
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's irking me is an individual comes in,

1000
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:43,457
[SPEAKER_13]: And you look at that individual, and they give you a license.

1001
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:44,457
[SPEAKER_13]: You say, get out of here.

1002
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,217
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not trying to work with me.

1003
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:47,538
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do that.

1004
01:00:47,558 --> 01:00:49,438
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's incident number three.

1005
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:50,178
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll cover that.

1006
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:58,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So some people will try to attack us.

1007
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And in those kind of incidents, we'll call 911.

1008
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:07,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like our clerks are sometimes, they're afraid.

1009
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:10,004
[SPEAKER_07]: to take things too far.

1010
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:26,029
[SPEAKER_13]: So are you saying that every challenge to, there's a threat of an attack by, so they would run the risk of never being able to come in your store again by threatening you like that?

1011
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:36,433
[SPEAKER_13]: If I was coming in with a fake license and said, get out of here, and I decided to throw a punch at you, I would never go in your store again, right?

1012
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:38,753
[SPEAKER_07]: No, customer is threatening us.

1013
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1014
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:42,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for saying like, oh, we're going to take your fake IDs away.

1015
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:55,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if it's a fake ID, do they have a legal right to take from a juvenile or somebody with a fake ID?

1016
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:57,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that law, to be honest with you.

1017
01:01:58,267 --> 01:02:01,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you have the right to confiscate it at that point.

1018
01:02:01,629 --> 01:02:03,331
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be a police matter, I would imagine.

1019
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:05,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll refer you to the law enforcement.

1020
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:16,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it would fall on the area of any kind of taking somebody's personal property, a fraudulent document.

1021
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:22,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it would be like seizing any other criminal activity, right?

1022
01:02:22,252 --> 01:02:25,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, you're not giving me back my illegal item.

1023
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:30,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you fall into that quagmire of like, okay, I'll call the police.

1024
01:02:30,654 --> 01:02:30,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1025
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:32,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought that was the procedure.

1026
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:34,795
[SPEAKER_13]: If they threw a fit, then you say, well, let's,

1027
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:39,159
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll hang on to it until the police arrive, and at that point, they're out of there.

1028
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:41,560
[SPEAKER_13]: They're bailing because they know it's phony.

1029
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an issue with a liquor store confiscating a juvenile's ID.

1030
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:56,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I do sympathize with Mr. Patella where somebody could get a little loud and mouthy and want their ID back.

1031
01:02:57,124 --> 01:03:02,666
[SPEAKER_09]: That confrontation, I wouldn't want that to escalate where there is a physical altercation over

1032
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:04,940
[SPEAKER_11]: or a fake ID.

1033
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:11,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So now does this new machine actually take a photo of the ID that was given to you that you put into it?

1034
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:14,751
[SPEAKER_11]: It scans the front and the back, right?

1035
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:21,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so it keeps the data, like if the metro city and the police officer wants, so like it shows like

1036
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:27,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it would be pretty easy if

1037
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:47,291
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you decided to give the ID back to the person, if there's going to be an issue or violence, you hand it back, obviously, because you don't want to get into that.

1038
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:48,972
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got video.

1039
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:51,833
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got that information now.

1040
01:03:52,253 --> 01:03:55,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you call the police, you can pass that on to them.

1041
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:58,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be the safest way to handle it.

1042
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1043
01:03:59,995 --> 01:04:02,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that sounds acceptable.

1044
01:04:02,696 --> 01:04:02,736
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1045
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:05,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Allen, any other?

1046
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:05,876
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1047
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:05,976
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1048
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:08,840
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1049
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:12,422
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point, we've taken our notes on alleged violation two.

1050
01:04:12,803 --> 01:04:15,705
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to move on to the third alleged violation.

1051
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:25,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Officer Smith, if you'd like to start reading that on the last paragraph of page two, I believe, at approximately 2045 hours.

1052
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:27,132
[SPEAKER_11]: This is again on November 8th, 2024.

1053
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:36,338
[SPEAKER_08]: At approximately 20, 45 hours, I observed a white BMW turn from Salem Street on River Street.

1054
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:40,199
[SPEAKER_08]: The BMW parked in a posted, no parking zone on River Street.

1055
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:46,540
[SPEAKER_08]: A male known to me as Cameron Vivalo exited the driver's seat of the BMW and proceeded to enter a method of wine and spirits.

1056
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had numerous interactions with Mr. Vivalo in the past and believed him to be under the age of 21.

1057
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:56,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Moments later, Mr. Vivalo exited a method of wine and spirits, holding a small black bag.

1058
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:59,682
[SPEAKER_08]: The way he was holding the bag was consistent with holding a bottle-shaped object

1059
01:05:02,117 --> 01:05:03,819
[SPEAKER_08]: to which he was born in 21.

1060
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,043
[SPEAKER_08]: When asked for identification, he stated it was in the car.

1061
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:10,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Asked how he purchased the alcoholic beverage without identification.

1062
01:05:10,688 --> 01:05:19,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Billmore explained he had been purchasing alcohol inside Method Wine and Spirits since he was 15 years of age and no one knew him.

1063
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:25,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside the black plastic bag was a 200-milliliter bottle of Tito's vodka.

1064
01:05:25,981 --> 01:05:29,166
[SPEAKER_08]: After conversing with Mr. Bibelow, he admitted that he was 20 years old.

1065
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:30,468
[SPEAKER_08]: His date of birth was April 25, 2004.

1066
01:05:30,548 --> 01:05:32,872
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, in fact, not 29 years of age.

1067
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:40,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Bivolo's demeanor changed during the course of our interaction, and our conversation became adverse.

1068
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:47,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm well aware of Mr. Bivolo's hostility towards law enforcement in the past and his propensity for violence.

1069
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Being alone on scene, our conversation spiraled in an adversarial direction.

1070
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:55,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I placed Mr. Bivolo into handcuffs and informed him he was being detained.

1071
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:59,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Multiple Medford police officers arrived on scene, including Sergeant James King.

1072
01:05:59,716 --> 01:06:01,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I entered Medford Wine and Spirits and spoke

1073
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:06,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go ahead and get started.

1074
01:06:06,187 --> 01:06:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go ahead and get started.

1075
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:31,135
[SPEAKER_08]: hologram on the ID of the adult, where the license number resulted in no reckoning with Connecticut R&D.

1076
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:35,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Fraudulent driver's license presented by Mr. Bivolo is 22 years of age.

1077
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:42,185
[SPEAKER_08]: He attempted to advise Mr. Bivolo about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications.

1078
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:45,267
[SPEAKER_08]: However, based on his response, he appeared unbothered.

1079
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:49,170
[SPEAKER_08]: The Tito's wife wrote a fraudulent Connecticut driver's license when it was seized.

1080
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:51,573
[SPEAKER_08]: No criminal charge will be filed against Mr. Bivolo.

1081
01:06:52,592 --> 01:07:02,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I then re-entered Medford Wine and Spirits, advised Mr. Rakesh Patel of my investigation, who contacted the owner, Mr. Dharam Patel, and we scheduled a meeting for the following day.

1082
01:07:03,439 --> 01:07:09,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It's essentially the facts per incident number three, and then I'll pass around the bid to the driver's license.

1083
01:07:09,683 --> 01:07:11,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

1084
01:07:11,684 --> 01:07:11,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1085
01:07:18,228 --> 01:07:20,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ended up seeing the video for this one.

1086
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:29,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just nonchalantly walks in and then walks up to the register, takes the ID out of his wallet, and just goes like this, and then puts it right back in his wallet.

1087
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:33,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And then walks right out the store, very nonchalantly.

1088
01:07:33,522 --> 01:07:33,802
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1089
01:07:37,462 --> 01:07:38,863
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's enhanced scrutinized?

1090
01:07:38,883 --> 01:07:39,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what you're saying?

1091
01:07:40,003 --> 01:07:42,063
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he just got it out of his wallet, more like this side.

1092
01:07:42,103 --> 01:07:42,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.

1093
01:07:42,843 --> 01:07:43,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1094
01:07:44,824 --> 01:07:46,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That was also the same from incident number one.

1095
01:07:46,844 --> 01:07:47,604
[SPEAKER_08]: So same thing.

1096
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:50,265
[SPEAKER_08]: They get it out of the wallet, go out, put it right back in the wallet.

1097
01:07:54,478 --> 01:07:55,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Incident number one?

1098
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:58,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that second purchase, that John Julio.

1099
01:07:58,459 --> 01:07:58,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

1100
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:02,561
[SPEAKER_08]: He just took it out of his wallet, went like this, and then put it back in the wallet, and put the video out.

1101
01:08:02,581 --> 01:08:04,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did not see the video from incident number two.

1102
01:08:05,302 --> 01:08:07,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1103
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:12,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I also didn't see, I wasn't aware and didn't see the incident from the October 31st.

1104
01:08:13,184 --> 01:08:15,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the November 1st one.

1105
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:18,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it because it didn't exist, you go there?

1106
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:19,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware of it.

1107
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:22,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It could have been discovered later, but I just wasn't aware of it.

1108
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:40,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Mr. Patel, would you care to comment on anything with alleged violation three with Mr. Vivlo?

1109
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:51,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so I would like to make one comment where he mentioned that like, Metro Buying Spirit since he was 15, he was still been buying alcohol since he was 15 years old.

1110
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:55,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe a similar comment on incident number one.

1111
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So we took over the Metro Buying Spirit last,

1112
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,983
[SPEAKER_07]: October or September.

1113
01:09:02,484 --> 01:09:09,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the prior owner had a lot of run-ins with these kind of instances.

1114
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:16,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think because of that reason, he kind of lost a lot of sales and went bankrupt almost.

1115
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:20,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to be there on the record that we took over ownership of

1116
01:09:21,978 --> 01:09:29,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe October 2023, if it's September or October, I can't recall.

1117
01:09:29,784 --> 01:09:37,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't know that MetraMining Spirit was famous, I guess, among MetraMining.

1118
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:49,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't know until this report, and now we're going to take even more stricter rules and policies and procedures.

1119
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,360
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so that's

1120
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's fine by me.

1121
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:56,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1122
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:08,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Just clarifying something?

1123
01:10:09,073 --> 01:10:09,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1124
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:13,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Incident two and three, so they happened on November 8th?

1125
01:10:13,516 --> 01:10:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: No, correct.

1126
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after incident, after the first incident,

1127
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:21,954
[SPEAKER_06]: with the five students in the car, that blurry ID.

1128
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anybody talk to the store?

1129
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:27,318
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

1130
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:28,398
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not.

1131
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:29,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah.

1132
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I went back and sat down and marked it.

1133
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, gotcha.

1134
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:41,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was after the second one where the guy had to get... So when the second incident was a little bit different, obviously.

1135
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:42,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.

1136
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,290
[SPEAKER_08]: It was potential that night that there were going to be criminal charges.

1137
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It was potential he was going to be arrested.

1138
01:10:51,802 --> 01:11:00,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to get into his history, but another officer, I'm very familiar with him, so is the other officer who was working with him and his family on lots of issues.

1139
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:04,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So the decision was made that night not to file any criminal charges.

1140
01:11:05,514 --> 01:11:15,682
[SPEAKER_08]: But because of what transpired, I needed to go into the store, I needed to look into it further, I needed to see that video right then and there because of the possibility of taking criminal action.

1141
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:17,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1142
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:18,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And close at 11?

1143
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:20,156
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when it closes.

1144
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:20,316
[SPEAKER_13]: 11 p.m.

1145
01:11:20,336 --> 01:11:21,036
[SPEAKER_13]: So when was what?

1146
01:11:21,056 --> 01:11:25,237
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 past 10 and when was quarter 11?

1147
01:11:25,277 --> 01:11:25,797
[SPEAKER_13]: 8.10 and I think 8.45.

1148
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:25,797
8.45.

1149
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:26,337
[SPEAKER_13]: 8.10 and 8.45.

1150
01:11:26,377 --> 01:11:31,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that was it for me from that's why it's very steady.

1151
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:31,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I just went on.

1152
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:47,530
[SPEAKER_08]: observations all of them.

1153
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:59,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Mr. Farhan Patel, did you like, did you wish to comment on the alleged violations?

1154
01:11:59,201 --> 01:11:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1155
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:57,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another clarifying question.

1156
01:12:57,678 --> 01:12:57,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1157
01:12:57,978 --> 01:13:02,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so, so then November 9th, we had a meeting.

1158
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:03,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1159
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:03,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1160
01:13:04,162 --> 01:13:04,762
[SPEAKER_08]: A full meeting.

1161
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:08,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like me to go into the meeting on the 9th?

1162
01:13:10,565 --> 01:13:11,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1163
01:13:11,245 --> 01:13:15,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys are all set as far as questions for the alleged third violation, correct?

1164
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:16,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1165
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:18,269
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, so that's the 8th.

1166
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:21,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Those two are the 8th and you put the new system in on the 9th.

1167
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:22,892
[SPEAKER_13]: On the morning of the 9th.

1168
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:23,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Morning of the 9th.

1169
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:28,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1170
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:28,824
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's okay.

1171
01:13:29,384 --> 01:13:30,325
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're here for.

1172
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:42,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we're done with all the questions on the alleged third violation, then Officer Smith is welcome to read the summary, which is where you left off, but Ben, take your time.

1173
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:54,518
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, I guess those... I think I'm clear on those three ones, so... Okay.

1174
01:13:55,757 --> 01:14:04,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, officer Smith, if you care to read the summary, um, which is continuing it at the end of the evening, I returned to the method police station.

1175
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:07,944
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the middle of page three, I believe.

1176
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to back up one second, one paragraph.

1177
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:13,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

1178
01:14:14,778 --> 01:14:29,025
[SPEAKER_08]: When I finished the third incident, Mr. Rakesh Patel, who was the fourth, I mean, then contacted Mr. Karen Patel, and we scheduled a meeting for the following day, 3.30, because we wanted to address this right away.

1179
01:14:29,585 --> 01:14:32,006
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the evening, I returned to the Medford Police Station.

1180
01:14:32,346 --> 01:14:37,729
[SPEAKER_08]: The two 12-packs of Nicole Valter and a bottle of T-Dogus vodka were disposed of in the trash barrel at the Medford Police Station.

1181
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:43,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Seized products, will and driver's licenses will be destroyed at the conclusion of today's administrative hearing.

1182
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:54,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the following day at approximately 3.30 p.m., I traveled to Medford-Wyden Spheres and spoke with Mr. Rakesh Patel and Mr. Karen Patel.

1183
01:14:54,945 --> 01:15:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I explained the entirety of my investigation and showed them the fraudulent driver's licenses from the night prior and from the first incident.

1184
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:08,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Karen Patel explained after receiving the phone call last evening, he ordered an ID scanner.

1185
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:14,976
[SPEAKER_08]: an ID visor, smart V2 ID scanner, and a manual for identifying fraudulent IDs.

1186
01:15:15,276 --> 01:15:22,601
[SPEAKER_08]: They also said they were purchasing black lights, ultraviolet lights, and books.

1187
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:23,902
[SPEAKER_08]: They were all in order.

1188
01:15:23,922 --> 01:15:32,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I went in on the 9th, he showed me the Amazon receipts that he purchased them, and they were to arrive on the 10th.

1189
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:35,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were going to be installed, and they were installed on the 10th.

1190
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:35,350
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 9th,

1191
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:48,788
[SPEAKER_08]: He explained that after receiving that phone call, and when they opened up the following day, himself and Mr. Rakesh would tell them that they downloaded an app to their phone.

1192
01:15:48,908 --> 01:15:49,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So check IDs.

1193
01:15:50,489 --> 01:15:54,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what they were going to use for the in-between until the new system arrived.

1194
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:59,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware of that they already had a system at the registry that they had been using.

1195
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:00,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't aware of that.

1196
01:16:02,178 --> 01:16:04,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Overall, I think we had a very positive meeting.

1197
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: They were very merciful to sell it to persons under 21.

1198
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:17,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And they took the necessary steps by buying it, purchasing a new ID scan of the books, the ultraviolet lights.

1199
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:21,338
[SPEAKER_08]: These are things that all should have been done.

1200
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, they own another business.

1201
01:16:23,138 --> 01:16:23,678
[SPEAKER_08]: They know.

1202
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:24,118
[SPEAKER_08]: They know.

1203
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,379
[SPEAKER_08]: They went and opened a store in 23.

1204
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:29,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially after the first incident.

1205
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm glad they took the necessary steps.

1206
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:34,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Those steps were completed before I even walked in the door.

1207
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,121
[SPEAKER_08]: on the night they made the purchase.

1208
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:41,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the Amazon receipts, and I know they will put in place on the 10th.

1209
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:50,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Because on the 10th, I started, Mr. Garen Patel started sending me emails of all these pictures of the IDs that they're sharing, because the system was actually, well, it worked.

1210
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:57,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked, and I went down and collected those IDs, and the new system seems to be working very well to prevent this from happening.

1211
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,891
[SPEAKER_08]: But overall, we had a very positive meeting.

1212
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:03,132
[SPEAKER_08]: They were remorseful for what transpired.

1213
01:17:03,927 --> 01:17:06,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's essentially the summary.

1214
01:17:07,549 --> 01:17:08,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, very good.

1215
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, do you have any comments on the summary of the police report on what

1216
01:17:24,274 --> 01:17:28,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to just add one point.

1217
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:42,284
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my family members in New York, he owns a liquor store and he had a similar kind of experience with underage teenagers with fake IDs and those investigations wouldn't lead to anywhere.

1218
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:45,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what they ended up doing, partnering with the

1219
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:56,939
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall and the police department, they come up with a strategy, if you will, implementing a $1,000 fine to the teenager who carries the fake ID.

1220
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:06,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can go on and on about catching this fake ID, confiscating, forwarding to the police department.

1221
01:18:06,946 --> 01:18:14,312
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's not going to lead to any penalties to the teenager carrying the IDs, it's like they're not

1222
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:19,107
[SPEAKER_07]: under pressure of not carrying the pay guide.

1223
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,947
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't care, you know?

1224
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:21,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1225
01:18:21,487 --> 01:18:34,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we implement, like if the Metricity implements some sort of guidelines, like first incident, second incident, they're like, there is a $1,000, $5,000 fee fine.

1226
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:43,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we forward the teenager information to the police department, they're able to enforce those fines on them.

1227
01:18:45,947 --> 01:18:51,708
[SPEAKER_07]: that will reduce the teenager carrying the fraudulent ID in the first place.

1228
01:18:51,748 --> 01:18:53,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be doing everything in our power.

1229
01:18:54,508 --> 01:19:01,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We order a second system that's better, but sometimes that's still not 100% of that I mentioned earlier.

1230
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's my personal comments.

1231
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:10,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, we can take that under advisement and refer it to our legal department.

1232
01:19:10,171 --> 01:19:15,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that's quite legal for us to do that without checking with them.

1233
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:26,569
[SPEAKER_11]: There is language, I believe, in 138 Mass General Laws that the store can be fined up to $2,000 for selling to a miner.

1234
01:19:32,543 --> 01:19:44,471
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm not, I'd have to really dig into it to see if there was any language in there for the minors, but it's something we can refer to our legal department and, you know, check that.

1235
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Officer, can you comment?

1236
01:19:45,952 --> 01:19:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the police side of things, I've discussed this at length with Lieutenant Walkowicz, and we seem to be in agreement of progressive discipline.

1237
01:19:54,437 --> 01:19:59,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of these people that we've interacted with, it's almost like one bite of the apple, right?

1238
01:20:00,101 --> 01:20:01,602
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a, this happens again,

1239
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,981
[SPEAKER_08]: then we will take criminal charges.

1240
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,441
[SPEAKER_08]: This will go through the court system.

1241
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:08,683
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be penalties of some sort, but they've all been advised of that.

1242
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:15,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but for this instance, we decided, you know, we'll explain the ramifications to them.

1243
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:21,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And then going forward, if this happens again, then we're going to take the criminal side of things.

1244
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:22,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1245
01:20:22,409 --> 01:20:22,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1246
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:23,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1247
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:29,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's basically what the verdict was when you appeared before us in June.

1248
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:42,059
[SPEAKER_11]: that we held a one day suspension in abidance for a year, meaning if you violate it again, then you get that one year suspension for that previous check.

1249
01:20:44,741 --> 01:20:48,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a servant to another age group, right?

1250
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:49,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was the same.

1251
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:56,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to ask one question is the clerk.

1252
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,771
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Rakesh.

1253
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:02,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he still working there?

1254
01:21:02,809 --> 01:21:10,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he, I mean, he was one, you know, he was the same one that sold to the miner back in June.

1255
01:21:11,855 --> 01:21:29,189
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Caron was also informed to abuse, got certified and obviously didn't either learn anything from it or just disregarded the respect for the law that, you know, you're supposed to follow.

1256
01:21:32,151 --> 01:21:39,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Mr. Rakesh still working for you, folks, or is he going to be supervised by some sort?

1257
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:46,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know that you were going to be working with him until this machine came or whatever.

1258
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:53,153
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that, you know, I feel bad for you as an owner that, you know, because of this

1259
01:21:56,312 --> 01:22:01,414
[SPEAKER_11]: you're going to have to pay the penalty on it, which is not really fair.

1260
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:07,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a business owner has to do when their employees don't follow the rules.

1261
01:22:07,197 --> 01:22:12,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's their, it's ultimately, they're the ones who make all the money, not their cash.

1262
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:13,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1263
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:19,223
[SPEAKER_13]: It could come to a bit if they start to a minor and they wrap the car around a tree or they kill somebody.

1264
01:22:19,243 --> 01:22:20,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1265
01:22:20,884 --> 01:22:21,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1266
01:22:21,264 --> 01:22:21,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it's too late.

1267
01:22:22,244 --> 01:22:22,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it's too late.

1268
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1269
01:22:28,536 --> 01:22:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I also just want to share just my opinion, but I do think that the police, in this case, have done a very thorough job of following up on all of these.

1270
01:22:37,878 --> 01:22:46,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I'm sure those kids whose parents have been informed, I mean, gosh, I remember a long time ago.

1271
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:52,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think if somebody's ID got taken a long time ago, growing up, there was no, you know, they've vanished.

1272
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think the police were calling their parents.

1273
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I never heard of it.

1274
01:22:56,883 --> 01:22:59,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think he's very thorough, he's very proactive too.

1275
01:22:59,545 --> 01:23:05,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, so I, I, you know, the fine thing, I don't even know what to say about that, but that's, that's really a step.

1276
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:07,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1277
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree too.

1278
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:16,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so like our story in Lowell, like, um, it's not the same level of help from the police department, so like Alex and Chris too.

1279
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, yeah, so respect is better, respect is due.

1280
01:23:19,997 --> 01:23:20,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1281
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:22,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think they're, they're on it.

1282
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:23,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1283
01:23:25,928 --> 01:23:26,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1284
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:36,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, at this point, is there anybody else that I'd like to speak on behalf of or against or anything else to say?

1285
01:23:38,377 --> 01:23:51,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what we're going to do is we're going to deliberate for a short period of time, 10, 15 minutes.

1286
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:53,728
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the three commissioners can

1287
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:02,813
[SPEAKER_11]: from testimony and we'll be back in and give you our decision.

1288
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:09,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we have both the offices here as well.

1289
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:13,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Get rid of these.

1290
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:16,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Switch glasses, you're getting old.

1291
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:23,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, these are the commission's findings for today's hearing.

1292
01:24:27,792 --> 01:24:41,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, apparently this commission, we weren't taken seriously on July 17th with the compliance checks hearing that we had given you folks a one day suspension, uh, held in abidance.

1293
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:49,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And you understood at that time that if you violated again within a year that you were going to get a one day license suspension.

1294
01:24:51,284 --> 01:24:52,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is.

1295
01:24:55,605 --> 01:25:00,629
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be in effect starting tomorrow on 11-27.

1296
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:15,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you seem to continue to disregard the law, especially after being TIP certified, the second offense that occurred on 11-1-24 will receive a two-day suspension.

1297
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:28,882
[SPEAKER_11]: that's going to be served 11, 29, 24, and 11, 30, 24.

1298
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:38,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Violation of Mass General Law 138, section 34, sale of alcoholic beverage to minors.

1299
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:49,958
[SPEAKER_11]: After being notified by Sergeant Covino on 11, 124, that you're still sold alcoholic

1300
01:25:53,707 --> 01:26:05,792
[SPEAKER_11]: on 11A at 20 hundred hours to again sell alcoholic beverages to a minor violating Mass General Law 13834.

1301
01:26:06,013 --> 01:26:08,094
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Michael Bailey.

1302
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:10,395
[SPEAKER_11]: He was 19 years old.

1303
01:26:11,995 --> 01:26:18,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And that became your third offense, which you will receive a three-day suspension for beginning 12-1.

1304
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:28,004
[SPEAKER_11]: 24, 12-2, 24, and 12-3, 24.

1305
01:26:28,424 --> 01:26:45,392
[SPEAKER_11]: 45 minutes later, on the 8th of November, you continued to disregard the law and sold to yet another minor, violating Mass General Law 138, Section 34, to Mr. Cameron Bibolo, 20 years old.

1306
01:26:46,412 --> 01:26:48,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And that became your fourth offense.

1307
01:26:52,806 --> 01:27:00,969
[SPEAKER_11]: which will be December 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of 2024.

1308
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, this is a total of 10 days suspension.

1309
01:27:10,253 --> 01:27:20,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Your Section 15 alcoholic beverage license is going to be suspended, and that's beginning tomorrow through December 7th.

1310
01:27:22,144 --> 01:27:28,790
[SPEAKER_11]: you may resume normal business hours of operation Sunday, December 8th of 2024.

1311
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:40,680
[SPEAKER_11]: You are to surrender your license from the premise and deliver it to Daria by 10 a.m.

1312
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,420
[SPEAKER_11]: tomorrow morning.

1313
01:27:45,103 --> 01:27:48,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Due to the fact that you purchased an ID scan,

1314
01:27:50,615 --> 01:27:56,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It shows that this commission, it shows this commission that you're trying to change your ways of doing business.

1315
01:27:58,843 --> 01:28:10,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to mitigate the two violations you admitted to today on October 31st and November 2nd.

1316
01:28:18,683 --> 01:28:22,086
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's the tip certification course.

1317
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:32,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You're well aware that what the acceptable forms of IDs are for the state of Massachusetts and out-of-state licenses.

1318
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:40,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with this machine, if it doesn't pick it up, an out-of-state license is not acceptable in the state of Massachusetts.

1319
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:43,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're doing that at your own risk.

1320
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:52,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I come in, you ID me, and I present you with an out-of-state license.

1321
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I'm over 21.

1322
01:28:55,989 --> 01:28:57,410
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not going to be a problem for you.

1323
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:00,770
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's somebody that's questionable, that's a problem.

1324
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:11,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if your machine guarantees that you're not fraudulent or whatever, but it's not acceptable in Massachusetts.

1325
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:31,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You're also going to be required to have all employees TIP certified, and ID training classes that need to be completed within 60 days, and forward copies to DARIA.

1326
01:29:31,442 --> 01:29:34,743
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mass Package Service Association can assist you with that.

1327
01:29:46,436 --> 01:29:51,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1328
01:29:51,818 --> 01:30:01,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, as I stated at the last hearing you attended in July, this city and commission take these major offenses seriously.

1329
01:30:03,303 --> 01:30:14,127
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these major offenses could have resulted in a tragedy or even a fatality, not only to the impaired body, but also to an innocent body.

1330
01:30:15,288 --> 01:30:15,928
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said,

1331
01:30:16,682 --> 01:30:32,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, as we go forward, if you should appear before this commission with another major offense, you could be facing an indefinite suspension or revocation of your license.

1332
01:30:37,197 --> 01:30:40,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you understand what this commission has told you, Mr. Patel?

1333
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:40,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1334
01:30:43,811 --> 01:30:47,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Patel, do you have any questions pertaining to this license suspension?

1335
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:56,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Would anyone else care?

1336
01:30:56,134 --> 01:30:57,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be

1337
01:31:10,908 --> 01:31:18,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be starting tomorrow, 11-27-24, through 12-7-24.

1338
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:24,612
[SPEAKER_11]: You may resume normal operation Sunday, 12-8-24.

1339
01:31:24,752 --> 01:31:32,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And so on Sunday, 12-8, we can't pick you up or license from the City Hall?

1340
01:31:32,494 --> 01:31:32,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1341
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:40,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, obviously, we're closed here on Sunday, but you'll be authorized to sell alcoholic beverages.

1342
01:31:40,935 --> 01:31:48,209
[SPEAKER_11]: on Sunday, the 8th, and just come by to pick up your license on Monday.

1343
01:31:50,353 --> 01:31:51,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, those are the dates.

1344
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,601
[SPEAKER_11]: where you sell other items.

1345
01:31:58,342 --> 01:32:02,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, you do lottery or any of that stuff, but that's totally up to you.

1346
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:05,407
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to close the doors.

1347
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:09,010
[SPEAKER_11]: You just cannot sell any alcoholic beverages.

1348
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:15,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you do, that could lead to a whole nother set of problems that you really don't wanna get into.

1349
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:25,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, is there any other questions you have on the suspensions or this matter?

1350
01:32:28,462 --> 01:32:33,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Would anyone else, police officers or commissioners care to comment?

1351
01:32:34,046 --> 01:32:40,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Chairman, is there a notification to the public of any signage?

1352
01:32:41,272 --> 01:32:44,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we did discuss that during deliberation.

1353
01:32:45,876 --> 01:32:49,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We are definitely going to give them

1354
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:58,132
[SPEAKER_11]: signage to post in the windows and on the entry door, letting the public know that you are in violation and that's why you're closed.

1355
01:32:58,152 --> 01:33:01,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not closed, but unable to sell alcohol beverages.

1356
01:33:02,433 --> 01:33:06,454
[SPEAKER_11]: We just have to look into the wording on that.

1357
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:12,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we have it ready by tomorrow morning, Daria can provide it with you.

1358
01:33:12,976 --> 01:33:15,416
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, we'll reach out to you and let you know.

1359
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Commissioner Giraldo.

1360
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have it in?

1361
01:33:22,543 --> 01:33:22,883
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good?

1362
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1363
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:28,287
[SPEAKER_13]: You do understand it's 10 days.

1364
01:33:28,307 --> 01:33:31,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been a whole lot worse.

1365
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:35,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Believe me, this is why we took longer than 15 minutes.

1366
01:33:35,392 --> 01:33:37,574
[SPEAKER_13]: We kind of hashed it out.

1367
01:33:37,594 --> 01:33:42,257
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we know that we purchased the package store on the 23rd.

1368
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:46,540
[SPEAKER_13]: So the SINs before the SINs we counted against you.

1369
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:49,659
[SPEAKER_13]: the word is out there.

1370
01:33:49,699 --> 01:34:11,208
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, so take this and there'll be a learning moment for all of us, especially where you guys, your whole family is in the, you know, you guys know backwards and forwards, but this could have been a lot worse because if you just, you knew the penalties, it could have been easily among either.

1371
01:34:11,248 --> 01:34:14,950
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but like I said, we, we try to be pro business,

1372
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,510
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the day, no one was seriously injured.

1373
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:24,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Law enforcement had made sure parents, everybody was aware of it and spoke with you.

1374
01:34:25,131 --> 01:34:32,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of one of the few reasons why we're not really throwing the book at you, so to speak.

1375
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:35,073
[SPEAKER_13]: So, like I said, take this, learn from it.

1376
01:34:36,293 --> 01:34:43,415
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to see you again for this violation because it's not going to be pretty if we see you again for this violation, okay?

1377
01:34:44,654 --> 01:35:00,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Just as a point of reference with Commissioner Matarana saying in the city of Medford rules and regulations, guidelines on disciplinary sanctions or defense major suspension, 30 days to revocation.

1378
01:35:01,423 --> 01:35:10,687
[SPEAKER_11]: So technically we should have given you 30 days today as a maximum, but we took into consideration what are you doing to better your business?

1379
01:35:10,807 --> 01:35:12,989
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing to improve this issue?

1380
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:13,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately,

1381
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,800
[SPEAKER_11]: that goes along with the territory.

1382
01:35:21,101 --> 01:35:24,966
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm sorry, I don't mean to... No, no, that's fine.

1383
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:27,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sorry.

1384
01:35:32,548 --> 01:35:38,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and are we going to get the instruction on the ID training within 60 days?

1385
01:35:38,553 --> 01:35:39,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Within 60 days.

1386
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:41,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We get that from, is it?

1387
01:35:41,596 --> 01:35:45,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what you want to do is, you know what the TIPS training is, correct?

1388
01:35:45,559 --> 01:35:45,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1389
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:57,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So any of your employees at this store need to be TIPS certified and a copy of their TIPS certifications should be sent to DAPR.

1390
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:59,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, it's something called

1391
01:36:00,549 --> 01:36:02,651
[SPEAKER_11]: ID training class.

1392
01:36:02,992 --> 01:36:12,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you get in contact with the Massachusetts Package Store Association, are you familiar with that?

1393
01:36:12,462 --> 01:36:18,027
[SPEAKER_11]: They will tell you where you can go and have that training for all of your employees as well.

1394
01:36:18,828 --> 01:36:20,630
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a certificate that comes with

1395
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:23,900
[SPEAKER_11]: we're not certified.

1396
01:36:24,442 --> 01:36:30,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you provide the copy of that instruction like either tomorrow when we come drop off the license so that

1397
01:36:32,216 --> 01:36:43,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that's going to be ready yet with you, Daria, but she's super busy with our... Yeah, or you can email it to me.

1398
01:36:43,519 --> 01:36:45,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1399
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't forget.

1400
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:55,063
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we'll give you a detailed report of what the violations are and what the dates are and everything else.

1401
01:36:55,103 --> 01:36:56,264
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know the gist of it.

1402
01:36:56,844 --> 01:37:03,447
[SPEAKER_11]: from tomorrow through the 8th, through the 7th, reopening on the 8th.

1403
01:37:06,809 --> 01:37:08,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, very good.

1404
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,411
[SPEAKER_11]: That concludes this hearing.

1405
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,192
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to adjourn.

1406
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:13,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Second motion.

1407
01:37:14,353 --> 01:37:15,053
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1408
01:37:15,273 --> 01:37:15,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1409
01:37:16,954 --> 01:37:17,655
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1410
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:19,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing and seeing none, D.I.

1411
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,197
[SPEAKER_11]: 7th, meeting's adjourned.
