    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=384.049">Brian,</a>  would you be OK with Gary just making the correction on the application? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=387.391">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=388.051">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=388.612">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=390.072">Yeah,</a>  that'd be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=391.373">And</a>  also, I don't know if you're aware of it, but we have an online application <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=400.622">and</a>  it'll be a lot more legible for us when we have to review it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=407.209">And</a>  the other thing I just wanted to remind you of, I forgot to remind Tufts of as well, just keep in mind, you know, a week or two out, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=421.125">a</a>  few days ahead of time, and she's got to make an agenda, and sometimes it involves a weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=425.409">So</a>  just give us a little leeway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=428.952">I</a>  know this was kind of a, I know the situation here, but that's not a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=434.977">Just</a>  in the future, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=436.219">It'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=539.368">Tell</a>  us a little bit about the events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=541.189">There's</a>  two events, correct?</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=542.89">Sure,</a>  yeah, there's two of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=544.691">One</a>  on December 12th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=548.692">7</a>  to 11 PM, and it's going to be a concert. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=553.093">Open</a>  to the public, and we're expecting around 80 people, but it could be slightly less, slightly more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=564.035">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=566.575">And</a>  the application says all alcohol, but as far as I know, we only expect to be serving beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=573.797">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=575.742">You</a>  know that you are allowed to serve all alcohol where you are a non-profit, just for future reference. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=581.744">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=582.364">Yeah,</a>  we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=583.304">I</a>  guess that's why she checked that box. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=586.745">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=587.485">We</a>  never know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=589.066">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=590.426">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=592.387">Alrighty,</a>  and that was on the 12th for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=595.107">That</a>  is on the 12th, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=597.148">Okay,</a>  I noticed that there were two second pages on this election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=609.972">I</a>  didn't know if the second one was a mistake, possibly should have been a sketch or an insurance certificate that may have been left out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=619.518">I</a>  see the sketch on the second one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=621.66">Yeah,</a>  it's the same sketch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=622.821">It's</a>  the same sketch.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=623.641">Yeah,</a>  we assume that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=633.416">Okay,</a>  what about the insurance coverage for that day, for the two days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=639.78">We</a>  need a quarter million dollar insurance from your insurance company for those two days.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=646.243">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=647.264">Again,</a>  they are on file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=650.446">I</a>  believe Daria has them, but I can send them along again if you want them.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=654.168">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=655.008">Okay,</a>  Daria will <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=658.55">reach</a>  out to you if they're not on file, and if you can get them over to us, that'd be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=663.054">Just</a>  send it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=664.295">Yeah,</a>  just send it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=664.975">Yeah,</a>  it's just easier for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=666.356">Yeah,</a>  just send it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=667.137">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=667.437">Just</a>  send it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=668.178">Yeah,</a>  Gary is in the middle of all those renewals and stuff now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=672.101">It's</a>  kind of hectic over here.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=674.142">Okay,</a>  no problem at all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=676.184">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=678.286">And</a>  so, is there any other questions about the first event, or should I tell you about the second one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=684.13">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=684.711">Yeah,</a>  we're fine with the first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=687.113">Go</a>  right ahead.</p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=690.724">What</a>  time is it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=692.405">No,</a>  you can go ahead and tell us about the second event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=695.488">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[nMlCJNUIswQ_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=696.209">So</a>  the second event is probably going to be much smaller. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=699.472">And</a>  we're actually, I have a question for you, because we might want to shift the day of this, because there's a conflict with a board meeting the same night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=709.661">And</a>  I know some of the board members would like to go to the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=713.398">But</a>  it's currently scheduled for the 19th from 7 to 9 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=717.94">And</a>  we're estimating maybe 25 people, but this close to Christmas, it could be less because people have so many other things to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=728.003">And</a>  again, it's open and we will be serving beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=735.557">And</a>  it's an odd combination of watching a movie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=740.42">And</a>  I think the movie is When Harry Met Sally, if any of you want to come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=746.264">And</a>  doing crochet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=747.885">So</a>  I don't know how this will work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=749.446">It's</a>  a first for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=750.466">But</a>  it sounds like it should be fun at any rate.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=754.229">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=755.069">Did</a>  you say the 19? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=757.771">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=758.131">The</a>  application, this one says 12-12 also? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=761.15">This</a>  is the smaller one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=762.612">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1564.97">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1568.383">Do</a>  you want me to continue from November 1st? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1569.824">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1570.885">So,</a>  obviously, my name is Patrick Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1575.189">I'm</a>  a police officer in the City of Manhattan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1576.61">I've</a>  been a police officer for 12 years, and I've been an agent for a method like a licensing commission for approximately a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1587.099">On</a>  November 1st, I received an email from Sergeant Christoph Camino from the Metropolitan Police Department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1593.46">That</a>  evening, he was the Eastside Sergeant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1595.942">He</a>  was in a mocked vehicle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1597.583">He</a>  was wearing a uniform and patrolling the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1601.626">The</a>  following email, I've redacted the juvenile's information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1605.609">There</a>  is specific information to the juvenile in the email, but for the purposes of this hearing, I'm going to redact it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1611.593">It</a>  states, Officer Smith, while on patrol, I noticed the vehicle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1615.396">We</a>  then provided a Massachusetts registration plate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1618.755">Pots</a>  idling on River Street next to Method Wine and Spirits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1622.618">The</a>  two occupants appear to be approximately 16 to 18 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1627.441">The</a>  car comes back to an adult male out of, that provides the address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1632.585">He</a>  ran the address and was able to locate the juvenile. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1637.909">By</a>  the time I circled the block, the car was gone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1640.43">I</a>  showed the clerk the picture of the juvenile from CJIS, and he verified the juvenile did buy alcohol in the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1649.231">The</a>  court claimed the juvenile had a valid ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1653.093">I'm</a>  not sure if you can use this to look into the business further. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1656.315">It</a>  seems to be common knowledge among underage persons that they can purchase alcohol from the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1661.759">Very</a>  respectfully, Sergeant Christopher Cacavino, Medford Police Department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1666.221">So</a>  that was the email that I received from Sergeant Cacavino on November 4th.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1671.564">And</a>  you continue on to on November 5th?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1675.567">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1677.325">So</a>  on November 5th, 2024, I traveled to the juvenile's residence and spoke with the juvenile and the juvenile's mother. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1684.908">Juvenile's</a>  mother's information is on file with the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1688.89">The</a>  juvenile was positively identified as 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1693.271">I</a>  explained to the juvenile and the juvenile's mother the reason for my presence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1697.173">The</a>  juvenile admitted to purchasing a bottle of Dawn Julio tequila from Medford Wine and Spirits located at 35 Sales Street Method <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1705.133">On</a>  Friday, November 1st, 2024, according to the juvenile, they presented the, according to the state of New Hampshire's driver's license, which identified the juvenile as 22 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1717.677">After</a>  presenting the state of New Hampshire driver's license, the juvenile was able to purchase the liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1723.039">The</a>  juvenile then handed me a New Hampshire driver's license that he or she used to purchase the liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1729.802">New</a>  Hampshire driver's license was clearly a fraudulent, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1734.143">The</a>  license cod stock was abnormally thick, the ID's lamination was peeling, and the overall color of the license was off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1740.991">The</a>  query of the license number resulted in no record in the New Hampshire R&D. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1745.896">I</a>  explained to the juvenile, the juvenile's mother that the fraudulent driver's license would be seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1749.72">The</a>  juvenile stated that the fake New Hampshire driver's license was purchased over the internet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1755.714">We</a>  then had a conversation about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications of purchasing and possessing liquor by persons under the age of 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1765.262">The</a>  juvenile was remorseful for their actions, and I believe the interaction was positive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1770.166">No</a>  criminal charges were filed against the juvenile. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1774.59">Now,</a>  I'd like to kind of skip ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1776.331">It</a>  is in relation to the first offense, but everything's kind of in order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1781.155">I</a>  was able to view video footage of the incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1786.075">In</a>  relation to the incident that took place on November 1st, the juvenile did purchase liquor inside of Metro Wine and Spirits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1798.484">The</a>  juvenile purchased a 12-pack of Poor's Light beer, a 6-pack of Tooties by Southwest, and a small bottle of liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1808.051">The</a>  juvenile did not present an ID during that purchase on November 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1814.842">The</a>  juvenile actually purchased a bottle of Don Julio the following day, on November 2nd, in which he presented the fake New Hampshire's driver's license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1826.271">So,</a>  the juvenile was confused as dates, I believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1832.096">So,</a>  and I'd also like to submit the commission would like <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1837.582">you're</a>  going to have to drive a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1839.584">Yes,</a>  we looked at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1840.705">We'd</a>  like to just ask that juveniles name on this is the juveniles name and we don't repeat that a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1846.329">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1846.949">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1884.938">I've</a>  already showed you that.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1889.041">Last</a>  question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1891.283">So</a>  did he provide that the second time he purchased the order, the time he made a notice?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1895.807">From</a>  the videos that I saw, the first purchase, which was the November 1st one, the Passage and Observe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1901.412">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1902.433">It</a>  was no IP presented during that purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1904.554">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1905.695">The</a>  following day, the Ball of Dawn Booyah was purchased and this IP was presented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1910.339">So</a>  that was the November 2nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1911.7">This</a>  was the November 2nd.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1912.881">That</a>  was presented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1913.562">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1917.519">Okay,</a>  Officer Smith, you were</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1945.393">If</a>  you'd like to continue to read where you left off.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1956.621">In</a>  between the two allegations of how we got to a break or just go right to two?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1964.246">No,</a>  we're not going to go right to two yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1966.167">I'm</a>  going to have you read that separate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1968.008">That's</a>  where it starts on page two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1971.568">It's</a>  one, two, third paragraph where it says on Friday, November 8th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1976.953">We're</a>  not going to read that right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1978.675">Let's</a>  read everything up to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1981.378">And</a>  that'll finish violation one, alleged violation one, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1987.944">And</a>  if anything else also in the summary that you feel is relevant to alleged violation one, it'd be great.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=1996.198">So</a>  after leaving the juvenile residence, I contacted the Metro Police State Resource Officer, Robert Pascantelli. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2002.259">According</a>  to Officer Pascantelli, Method One experience is well known among high school students as a liquor store that sells underage persons. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2009.841">Officer</a>  Pascantelli is aware of this information from direct conversations with students of Method High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2015.162">I</a>  advised Officer Pascantelli of my interaction with the juvenile. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2018.963">I</a>  then contacted Lieutenant Walkowicz and advised him of my investigation into Sergeant Camino's email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2024.165">Lieutenant</a>  Walkowicz spoke with Captain Camino <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2026.145">an</a>  authorization was granted to investigate the purchasing of liquor by persons under the age of 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2032.006">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2032.667">That's</a>  essentially the summary for our bylaw.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2035.647">Okay,</a>  before we go in to this any further, I'd like to swear everybody in that's going to be testifying or speaking today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2048.03">Whoever's</a>  going to be testifying or speaking, please raise your right hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2056.902">I</a>  swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2061.624">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2062.404">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2064.105">I</a>  was shuffling one of your papers around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2067.346">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2069.087">At</a>  this point in time, we're going to give the licensee, Mr. Patel, an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2079.191">Either</a>  you can speak, the clerk can speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2081.872">If</a>  you have a representative, you're welcome to speak at this time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2086.945">I'm</a>  going to explain the situation because he doesn't speak clear English. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2093.706">He</a>  does speak English, but I'm the owner of Metro Alliance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2097.427">This</a>  is my brother, Kiran Patel.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2099.388">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2100.508">So</a>  in our system, we cannot check the same ID information within the 24 hour period. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2108.91">So</a>  we check the individual impression, the ID on October 31st, the day prior, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2116.902">And</a>  so on November 1st, he wouldn't allow us to enter the same ID information, but then the second day, November 2nd, when he came back, we also asked for his ID and entered the information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2127.416">And</a>  so at first, like prior to this incident, we had a <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2134.448">register</a>  in built ID tech system, which is not sometimes accurate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2139.415">And</a>  for reference, I have a screenshot of the system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2143.44">So</a>  in one system, we would say the ID is okay, but we got a newer system now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2149.24">that</a>  runs through the DMV that says the ID is false. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2154.283">But</a>  with that being said, there is no one system that works perfectly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2158.426">It's</a>  not like one system consistently catches the fake ID over the other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2164.81">Sometimes</a>  one system will catch, the other system will fail, and sometimes one system will catch, the other system will fail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2171.395">And</a>  the reason being sometimes these fake IDs are so, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2175.217">created</a>  perfectly, the barcode or the information sometimes will go through the DMV, but there is no system in the market that will give us like, let's say you have a driver license on your DMV, what your profile picture is, like that's not going to give to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2192.071">So</a>  if we were to create a fake <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2194.947">license</a>  creating your information with my picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2199.789">It</a>  will still pass through the system, but it will make it harder to get the driver's license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2206.011">So</a>  that's the reference between the two systems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2208.252">One</a>  will say, OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2209.693">Other</a>  is going to say, not related to the DMV.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2214.635">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2215.415">Now,</a>  sir, you mentioned that you are the owner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2217.676">Are</a>  you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2218.957">My</a>  name is Vatsal Patel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2221.818">I'm</a>  sorry, your first name? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2222.958">Vatsal.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2225.733">A-T-S-A-L.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2230.599">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2231.28">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2232.001">And</a>  this gentleman is?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2234.343">He's</a>  my brother. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2235.024">He</a>  helps run the store and he's the first-hand witness to the events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2243.675">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2244.692">And</a>  how do you spell your name, sir? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2247.474">K-I-R-A-N.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2249.295">K-I-R-A-N.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2251.236">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2252.257">So</a>  neither one of you gentlemen are the clerk that was in the store that day? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2256.68">Rakesh.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2257.521">Rakesh.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2258.261">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2261.003">And</a>  you mentioned the scan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2262.204">I</a>  know you're upgrading to the ID buys a smart V2 ID scanner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2266.247">What</a>  do you have in there now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2267.407">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2271.712">At</a>  the same night, when officer Smith called me, at the same night, we ordered a new system to verify more accuracy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2280.474">But</a>  now we're more confused than ever, because now one will say it passed, the other system doesn't pass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2286.395">And</a>  like I said, it's not like one system got it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2288.875">And</a>  I want to mention one more thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2291.775">With</a>  the junior board, what officer Smith said about the board don't fool you, he said, I believe, on November 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2301.43">He</a>  was born on November 2nd, and that time he showed the ID, the New Hampshire ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2308.652">The</a>  video officers didn't show on November 1st, he didn't present the ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2314.054">But</a>  October 31st, he came and we verified that time, his date of birth, all the information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2320.916">They</a>  telling me like fluent, without any hesitation, they verified those information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2326.558">That's</a>  why we was believing like those IDs like real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2331.093">You</a>  know, that was November 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2334.035">Yeah,</a>  October 31st also he presents the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2339.278">What</a>  I don't understand is, um, you, when you were explaining about the machine, the ID machine, you said that you started out with, um, the 31st of October. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2354.221">But</a>  this incident was the first, so you're trying to, the way I understand it is you're trying to tell me if you put an ID in this machine, it doesn't instantly tell you that this is fraudulent or not? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2367.632">So</a>  it does, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2369.393">If</a>  it passes, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2370.755">Or</a>  even if it doesn't pass, it's like once we enter the ID information into the system, we cannot enter the same ID information for 24 hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2379.202">And</a>  the reason being, they charge us $1.50, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2382.865">to</a>  verify the ID information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2385.547">So</a>  they have a built-in protection that we don't like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2388.088">So</a>  if we scan one SAM ID five times, they don't charge us five times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2392.711">It's</a>  only scanned one time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2394.472">So</a>  that's the reason, yeah, it's a 0.4 hours window period that we can enter their ID information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2401.235">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2402.436">So</a>  why didn't it work on November 1st when you scanned it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2409.127">I</a>  was the alleged juvenile in there the day before they could have purchased something, and maybe you wouldn't have seen it the following day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2420.695">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out why it's, you know, why this... So prior to November 1st, we only had one system in place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2428.58">Now</a>  we have two systems.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2430.381">We</a>  purchased the same night when we talked with Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2434.323">The</a>  same night we purchased the new system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2437.645">So</a>  the newest system can you scan it as often as you like, say the same person comes in</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2453.79">two</a>  times, three times a day, and a different clerk is working, obviously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2457.712">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2459.133">They</a>  don't know that the person was in earlier and showed a positive ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2462.355">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2462.955">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2463.335">So</a>  this new system can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2465.036">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2465.856">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2466.937">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2467.097">And</a>  you got that on the first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2470.299">You</a>  got that new system on November 1st.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2473.72">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2474.401">I</a>  was already all day in the store. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2478.083">Once</a>  the system arrived, then we set it up the same day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2483.098">On</a>  November 10th, with the new system and old system, we got four more fake IDs that I reported to the officer Smith at the same night with the email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2494.681">And</a>  there was some, because once you take the ID and see size, the people, they're getting mad, you know, like the customer, they want those IDs back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2504.364">So</a>  one of the customers, we have a little hard argument. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2507.525">So</a>  that time I called 911 from the Lawrence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2511.051">to</a>  get some assistance over here, but nobody show up after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2515.675">Then</a>  I talk already officers meet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2519.038">Because</a>  sometimes the violence can create because those customer, once you take those ID, they're getting mad, you know, they need that ID because they don't want to share the information also.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2529.607">So</a>  help me understand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2531.508">So</a>  on November 1st, no license was asked for, but on November 2nd, a license was asked for at the purchase</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2539.74">Yes,</a>  and that's October 31st as well also.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2544.702">Can</a>  I just, your education is you guys are bringing to light that on October 31st the same kid came in in Bottlicker gave that fake ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2554.185">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2555.0">And</a>  then you checked it that time it passed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2557.142">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2557.522">Then</a>  they come in the next day because it's within 24 hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2561.505">You</a>  did not check it on the next day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2563.607">And</a>  that's when he bought done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2565.168">Well,</a>  he bought beer that day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2570.873">Then</a>  he comes in the next day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2572.234">He's</a>  on a roll, comes back in and then presents it on the next day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2576.317">And</a>  then you got on the, on the second and then he presents it to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2579.4">So</a>  that, that, that idea that when we passed around, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2582.391">But</a>  it passed that ID? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2586.413">Well,</a>  the first time you scanned it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2587.994">So</a>  we ordered it on the 1st of November, but we didn't get it like a few days after that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2593.117">But</a>  on the 31st when you first gave it to you, it passed the system? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2597.179">But</a>  it was on the old system.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2611.993">And</a>  then when you spoke to him, he admitted to one time that we probably was going three days in a row. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2619.137">And</a>  so he got confused. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2621.299">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2622.579">Now,</a>  what day was that new system actually up and running?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2641.343">This</a>  one, not really.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2645.205">November</a>  10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2646.745">November</a>  10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2647.225">On</a>  the morning, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2648.446">The</a>  system will start working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2649.807">What</a>  system?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2652.128">And</a>  what's your policy on carding people? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2654.989">I</a>  mean, I go places, and I think I can say that person's not of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2660.671">That</a>  person's not of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2663.152">What's</a>  your store policy if you <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2665.491">All</a>  right, everybody up to 33 years old.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2667.612">What</a>  is your policy? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2669.213">Oh,</a>  everybody, everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2671.354">And</a>  if you have a doubt, you card everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2674.236">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2674.876">Even</a>  when we have inspection, like I submitted the Mystic Way inspection, they came, that person was like almost 35, and we still ask the ID and they give your certificate for the asking ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2689.785">I</a>  submitted to the Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2691.206">Remember</a>  Daria? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2691.766">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2691.886">The</a>  tips? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2692.187">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2702.061">Is</a>  there anything else you'd like to say on behalf of this first violation that we're speaking about?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2708.064">Was</a>  this that you were showing me?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2715.047">Was</a>  this an example of a fake ID?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2716.828">It</a>  is a fake ID, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2718.569">And</a>  it's a reference to that your pass is in one system but fails in the other system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2724.454">And</a>  we are constantly getting more and more ideas.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2763.544">Now</a>  this DMV check, is that for all DMVs or just Massachusetts?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2768.725">No,</a>  40 plus allows us to run through their DMV.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2791.031">May</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2791.911">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2793.686">So</a>  when we met on November 9th, you told me you and Rakesh downloaded an app to your iPad, and that was the app that you were going to use to check IDs until the new system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2807.69">The</a>  new system is a very late system from what I've heard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2812.612">But</a>  you told me that between our phone call on November 8th and when we met on November 9th, you and Rakesh both downloaded an app to your phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2824.176">use</a>  until the new system arrived. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2828.358">So</a>  what system did you use on October 31st?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2834.762">It's</a>  a built-in register. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2836.483">So</a>  I guess that's three systems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2838.083">So</a>  the former one was temporary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2839.264">Now</a>  we just have two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2840.065">One</a>  is built-in register and one is the newer one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2854.492">The</a>  phone app was just a temporary solution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2857.714">But</a>  that wasn't reliable either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2860.236">That</a>  still passes the IDs sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2863.198">So</a>  there was a system in place on October 31st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2867.241">You</a>  had all these people coming in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2870.483">It</a>  just wasn't sophisticated enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2872.745">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2873.705">Because</a>  all of these, from this picture, I see that picture, that's all from the new system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2877.648">That's</a>  all brand new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2878.308">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2878.669">I</a>  have the HD one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2879.309">I</a>  have the HD smartphone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2882.944">just</a>  a general question to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2885.526">So</a>  how many other liquor stores? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2887.707">So</a>  do you have that same system? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2889.588">You</a>  own other liquor stores, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2891.269">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2891.569">It's</a>  a bit of advice.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2911.24">Yeah,</a>  one other one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2913.922">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2914.823">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2915.224">Okay,</a>  not to get into No, we ordered the new system because we in our experience this system is better than other but like I said, it's not 100% guaranteed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2928.155">Yes,</a>  sometime our QoS system will catch a fake ID and it'll pass through this system because it's how they process <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2936.959">Because</a>  this goes to the VM view. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2939.34">So</a>  like I said, if I create a fake ID with the barcode, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2944.741">With</a>  genuine barcode, with another identifier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2948.681">Let's</a>  say we are talking about us two, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2951.542">So</a>  if I create a fake ID that has my picture for all of your information, including the barcode, that will pass to the new system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2960.484">Because</a>  there is no system anywhere on the market that gives us <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2966.36">what</a>  the picture is on the DMV profile, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2970.801">So</a>  then we can compare.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2974.022">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2975.222">Is</a>  there facial recognition software?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2977.443">No,</a>  there isn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2978.203">So</a>  that's the dilemma. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2981.224">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2982.264">So</a>  that's just explaining what the loophole is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2985.925">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2986.726">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2987.226">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2987.326">But</a>  we believe it to be better because it goes through the DMV. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2990.607">So</a>  sometimes, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2992.807">It</a>  depends how they create the fake IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2996.387">OK,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=2998.208">OK,</a>  are there any other questions from anyone pertaining to alleged violation one?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3006.972">OK,</a>  just for reference, that idea that was passed around that that's also true about a month, which is right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3013.936">I</a>  spoke at the photo, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3015.837">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3016.217">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3020.901">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3021.743">And</a>  they know, you said you already spoken to their parents, they didn't purchase these gentlemen were <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3030.73">That's</a>  very good.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3031.511">The</a>  following weekend, I did receive a phone call from Mr. Bedell that they had seized some licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3038.496">And</a>  I went in and took possession of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3043.579">And</a>  then I also want to speak to that one time where he said he contacted the Metro Police and we didn't show up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3048.423">I</a>  spoke to that officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3050.304">When</a>  he responded, there were no juveniles inside the store, so we continued on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3054.347">He</a>  did not go into the business and speak to Mr. Kesh Patel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3058.012">He</a>  did respond, looked inside, there were no juveniles inside causing any kind of disturbance, and they continued on to the judges.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3066.47">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3067.191">Well,</a>  at this point, why don't we move on to the we've taken our notes and we're going to move on to the second alleged violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3075.558">Officer</a>  Smith, if you care to read it from on the second violation, beginning it on Friday, November 8th, twenty twenty four in her report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3085.586">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3086.667">On</a>  Friday, November 8th, twenty twenty four, I traveled to multiple licensed liquor establishments within the city of Medford and observed how business was being conducted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3094.811">I</a>  wore a full Method police uniform, wearing the same thing that I wore that night, and I was in an unmarked Method police vehicle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3102.516">This</a>  started about 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3105.779">I</a>  got to the station about 7.30, got in the car, and then just started going up and driving around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3111.182">At</a>  eight o'clock, I parked on the corner of Salem Street, River Street, and I'm serving Method blind and spirits, located at 45 Salem Street, at approximately 8.10 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3122.509">I</a>  observed a tan in color Toyota Camry turn from Salem Street onto River Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3128.214">The</a>  vehicle appeared to be occupied by five teenagers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3132.078">Camry</a>  parked in the parking lot behind them and wanted spirits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3135.08">A</a>  male exited the driver's seat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3137.342">Based</a>  on the male's physical characteristics, he appeared to be under the age of 18. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3141.723">The</a>  male proceeded to enter and measure wine and spirits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3144.486">Moments</a>  later, the male exited the store carrying two 12-packs and a nickel of ultra-alcoholic beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3149.17">I</a>  approached the male and asked him how old he was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3151.552">He</a>  responded by stating at 19. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3154.515">When</a>  asked how he was able to purchase the beer, the male explained he showed the clerk a picture ID on his phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3161.47">male</a>  was subsequently positively identified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3163.412">Do</a>  you want me to dig up his information or do I just say it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3165.733">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3166.274">You</a>  can dig that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3167.495">Okay,</a>  so the male was positively identified as Michael Bailey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3170.557">Date</a>  of birth is December 24th, 2005. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3174.08">He</a>  is, in fact, 19 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3176.481">After</a>  conversing with Mr. Bailey, he presented me with a fraudulent Massachusetts driver's license that identified himself as 23 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3183.907">Mr.</a>  Bailey explained he used the fraudulent Massachusetts driver's license to purchase the beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3188.59">The</a>  Massachusetts driver's license <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3191.912">fraudulence,</a>  a photograph of the license was blurry and a hologram of the center was missing, where the license number resulted in no record in the Massachusetts R&D. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3200.974">I</a>  then spoke with the passengers of Mr. Daley's vehicle and identified them as all, they were all high school students, all five years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3206.635">Mr.</a>  Daley was advised about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications for purchasing slash possessing liquor by persons under the age of 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3217.697">Mr.</a>  Bailey was remorseful for his actions, and I believe our interaction was positive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3221.681">The</a>  two 12-packs and nickel of ultra and the fake driver's license were seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3227.447">No</a>  criminal charges were filed against Mr. Bailey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3229.609">So</a>  I'd like also to submit Mr. Bailey's fake ID that he used that evening.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3245.852">I</a>  was curious about this license, because when I read the report, it said it was blurry, and all of a sudden it was missing.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3258.84">And</a>  this went through the machine? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3259.86">It</a>  was in the machine room, yes.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3289.82">Mr.</a>  Smith, did this individual say when he was calling or not? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3295.443">Did</a>  that come out in conversation?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3297.485">He</a>  initially told me that he used a photo of his ID on his phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3302.347">And</a>  then he started scrolling through his phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3304.829">And</a>  I said, you know, did you use an ID or not? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3307.711">And</a>  then he came up with the ID on his phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3309.912">And</a>  he said he wanted a cop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3311.273">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3311.813">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3312.193">That's</a>  the only time.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3321.763">Do</a>  you allow, if someone has a picture of their ID on their iPhone, would you allow that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3326.865">You</a>  know, physical ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3328.246">And</a>  another thing, we follow strict procedure, where like if, let's say five of them were to come into the store, we would ID all five. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3336.289">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3336.509">That's</a>  why they swiped up and they only send one person in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3340.191">So</a>  it's like we're trying best on our side to do it, but like if you are to come further down the road, we don't know how many hours in the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3349.655">We</a>  do the best we can to see, but we can only go so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3353.418">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3353.538">I'll</a>  show some of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3354.259">Hologram</a>  is the one we can catch it by.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3357.901">I'm</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3358.222">I</a>  haven't done the alpha pilot with this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3360.884">Just</a>  holding on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3361.484">Yeah,</a>  it's a start.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3416.174">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3417.555">So</a>  the new system wouldn't pick that up as a fight or flight date? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3421.378">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3421.498">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3423.02">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3423.841">Gentlemen.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3425.382">I'm</a>  sorry, currently individuals, that's always been your policy? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3428.925">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3430.026">The</a>  day you open the doors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3431.868">So</a>  we did have an incident in... Was it an incident? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3435.948">I</a>  mean, yeah, but after the first thing, some of the like stricter all the policies.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3439.929">Yeah,</a>  Alan, Ben, like you care to comment?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3452.653">Yeah,</a>  well, thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3456.867">I</a>  guess, and I'm just trying to remind, does tips cover, like, how to evaluate IDs?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3462.748">Yeah,</a>  if I could see that again, I was looking for something and I want to see where it's on mine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3468.409">I</a>  didn't see it on that.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3469.629">Because</a>  I did see this hologram family in the center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3472.99">I</a>  mean, honestly, as a layperson, seeing it, I wouldn't obviously know right away, like I'm thinking of somebody handing me it, but I think you do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3484.228">handle</a>  them all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3485.27">Now</a>  looking at my idea clearly, I can see that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3490.32">Now</a>  did you gentlemen take the TIP certification? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3493.987">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3495.55">I'm</a>  sure they went over <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3498.107">how</a>  to check for an ID, whether they're valid or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3501.028">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3501.568">And</a>  we do our best. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3502.848">And</a>  Rakesh Patel, so he's a little bit older, he wears glasses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3507.449">So</a>  sometimes it's hard for him to see the hologram and whatnot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3511.13">But</a>  like I said, if that, I'd even pass the UV test, but not, like, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3517.851">Well,</a>  the only reason why is shortly after the compliance checks, as Sudeep mentioned, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3525.792">I,</a>  Sophie had offered tip certification free of charge for on-premise and off-premise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3533.734">And</a>  I took the tips certification and part of it was saying, you know, telling you just quick tricks if something's valid or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3543.515">And</a>  I looked on yours, not yours, Mr. Bailey's, and I couldn't remember <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3553.089">what</a>  one of the tricks were until I just checked mine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3556.231">And</a>  where the hologram is, below the hologram, it should have the person's first initial, first name initial, last name initial, and the year they were born. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3569.096">On</a>  mine, it's RD55. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3570.617">I'm</a>  old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3572.078">But</a>  this has nothing like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3575.319">You</a>  can barely see the hologram, and it's not there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3579.701">The</a>  initials and the date of birth <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3582.671">Um,</a>  so, I mean, that's for me, somebody that never checks IDs, that's, you know, it's kind of like, okay, well, I know that, but for you guys to check them, if you're in doubt at all, just put your phone on and look and say, okay, it's not showing through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3597.961">This</a>  is okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3599.842">Pretty,</a>  pretty cut and dry, but this is pretty obvious that it's not a real ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3607.167">Um,</a>  but anyways, that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3611.462">I'm</a>  sorry I didn't interrupt, but we just wanted to get that screen away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3617.524">OK,</a>  so anything else you gentlemen would like to say in regards to LH violation too? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3625.868">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3626.288">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3627.428">My</a>  fellow commissioners, Alan, Ben, anything?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3630.109">Any</a>  other comments on LH violation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3633.051">You</a>  know what's irking me is an individual comes in, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3639.556">And</a>  you look at that individual, and they give you a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3643.497">You</a>  say, get out of here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3644.477">You're</a>  not trying to work with me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3646.237">You</a>  got to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3647.558">So</a>  that's incident number three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3649.478">We'll</a>  cover that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3650.378">So</a>  some people will try to attack us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3659.04">And</a>  in those kind of incidents, we'll call 911. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3663.721">So</a>  it's like our clerks are sometimes, they're afraid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3668.183">to</a>  take things too far.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3670.024">So</a>  are you saying that every challenge to, there's a threat of an attack by, so they would run the risk of never being able to come in your store again by threatening you like that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3686.469">If</a>  I was coming in with a fake license and said, get out of here, and I decided to throw a punch at you, I would never go in your store again, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3697.032">No,</a>  customer is threatening us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3698.893">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3699.634">Yeah,</a>  for saying like, oh, we're going to take your fake IDs away.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3705.038">Well,</a>  if it's a fake ID, do they have a legal right to take from a juvenile or somebody with a fake ID? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3715.665">I</a>  don't know that law, to be honest with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3718.267">I</a>  don't know if you have the right to confiscate it at that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3721.629">That</a>  would be a police matter, I would imagine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3723.351">Yeah,</a>  I'll refer you to the law enforcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3727.268">I</a>  don't think it would fall on the area of any kind of taking somebody's personal property, a fraudulent document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3736.19">I</a>  guess it would be like seizing any other criminal activity, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3742.252">Like,</a>  oh, you're not giving me back my illegal item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3746.393">So,</a>  you know, you fall into that quagmire of like, okay, I'll call the police.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3750.654">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3750.974">And</a>  I thought that was the procedure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3752.714">If</a>  they threw a fit, then you say, well, let's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3755.278">We'll</a>  hang on to it until the police arrive, and at that point, they're out of there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3759.199">They're</a>  bailing because they know it's phony.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3762.04">I</a>  don't have an issue with a liquor store confiscating a juvenile's ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3764.901">I</a>  do sympathize with Mr. Patella where somebody could get a little loud and mouthy and want their ID back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3777.124">That</a>  confrontation, I wouldn't want that to escalate where there is a physical altercation over</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3784.019">or</a>  a fake ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3785.18">So</a>  now does this new machine actually take a photo of the ID that was given to you that you put into it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3791.927">It</a>  scans the front and the back, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3795.271">Yes,</a>  so it keeps the data, like if the metro city and the police officer wants, so like it shows like <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3805.734">Okay,</a>  so it would be pretty easy if</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3818.649">You</a>  know, if you decided to give the ID back to the person, if there's going to be an issue or violence, you hand it back, obviously, because you don't want to get into that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3828.172">You've</a>  got video. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3829.352">You've</a>  got that information now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3832.253">And</a>  then when you call the police, you can pass that on to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3836.294">I</a>  think that would be the safest way to handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3838.134">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3839.995">I</a>  mean, that sounds acceptable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3842.696">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3844.096">Allen,</a>  any other? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3845.736">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3845.936">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3848.6">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3848.86">At</a>  this point, we've taken our notes on alleged violation two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3852.803">We're</a>  going to move on to the third alleged violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3857.205">Officer</a>  Smith, if you'd like to start reading that on the last paragraph of page two, I believe, at approximately 2045 hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3865.971">This</a>  is again on November 8th, 2024.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3871.337">At</a>  approximately 20, 45 hours, I observed a white BMW turn from Salem Street on River Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3876.958">The</a>  BMW parked in a posted, no parking zone on River Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3880.579">A</a>  male known to me as Cameron Vivalo exited the driver's seat of the BMW and proceeded to enter a method of wine and spirits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3887.18">I've</a>  had numerous interactions with Mr. Vivalo in the past and believed him to be under the age of 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3892.241">Moments</a>  later, Mr. Vivalo exited a method of wine and spirits, holding a small black bag. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3896.721">The</a>  way he was holding the bag was consistent with holding a bottle-shaped object <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3902.117">to</a>  which he was born in 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3904.54">When</a>  asked for identification, he stated it was in the car. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3907.424">Asked</a>  how he purchased the alcoholic beverage without identification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3910.688">Mr.</a>  Billmore explained he had been purchasing alcohol inside Method Wine and Spirits since he was 15 years of age and no one knew him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3920.292">Inside</a>  the black plastic bag was a 200-milliliter bottle of Tito's vodka. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3925.981">After</a>  conversing with Mr. Bibelow, he admitted that he was 20 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3929.466">His</a>  date of birth was April 25, 2004. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3930.548">He</a>  is, in fact, not 29 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3935.338">Mr.</a>  Bivolo's demeanor changed during the course of our interaction, and our conversation became adverse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3940.322">I'm</a>  well aware of Mr. Bivolo's hostility towards law enforcement in the past and his propensity for violence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3947.687">Being</a>  alone on scene, our conversation spiraled in an adversarial direction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3952.271">I</a>  placed Mr. Bivolo into handcuffs and informed him he was being detained. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3956.294">Multiple</a>  Medford police officers arrived on scene, including Sergeant James King. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3959.716">I</a>  entered Medford Wine and Spirits and spoke <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3964.265">I'm</a>  going to go ahead and get started. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3966.187">I'm</a>  going to go ahead and get started. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3985.13">hologram</a>  on the ID of the adult, where the license number resulted in no reckoning with Connecticut R&D. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3991.575">Fraudulent</a>  driver's license presented by Mr. Bivolo is 22 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=3996.259">He</a>  attempted to advise Mr. Bivolo about the seriousness of underage alcohol consumption and the possible ramifications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4002.905">However,</a>  based on his response, he appeared unbothered. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4005.948">The</a>  Tito's wife wrote a fraudulent Connecticut driver's license when it was seized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4009.451">No</a>  criminal charge will be filed against Mr. Bivolo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4012.592">I</a>  then re-entered Medford Wine and Spirits, advised Mr. Rakesh Patel of my investigation, who contacted the owner, Mr. Dharam Patel, and we scheduled a meeting for the following day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4023.439">It's</a>  essentially the facts per incident number three, and then I'll pass around the bid to the driver's license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4029.683">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4031.684">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4038.228">So</a>  I ended up seeing the video for this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4041.319">And</a>  he just nonchalantly walks in and then walks up to the register, takes the ID out of his wallet, and just goes like this, and then puts it right back in his wallet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4050.481">And</a>  then walks right out the store, very nonchalantly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4053.522">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4057.462">So</a>  what's enhanced scrutinized? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4058.883">Is</a>  that what you're saying?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4060.003">No,</a>  he just got it out of his wallet, more like this side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4062.103">Here</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4062.843">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4064.824">That</a>  was also the same from incident number one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4066.844">So</a>  same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4067.624">They</a>  get it out of the wallet, go out, put it right back in the wallet.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4074.478">Incident</a>  number one?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4076.019">Yes,</a>  that second purchase, that John Julio. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4078.459">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4078.879">He</a>  just took it out of his wallet, went like this, and then put it back in the wallet, and put the video out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4082.581">So</a>  I did not see the video from incident number two.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4085.302">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4088.022">I</a>  also didn't see, I wasn't aware and didn't see the incident from the October 31st.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4093.184">Yeah,</a>  so the November 1st one.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4096.385">Is</a>  it because it didn't exist, you go there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4098.426">I</a>  wasn't aware of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4099.486">It</a>  could have been discovered later, but I just wasn't aware of it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4110.375">Okay,</a>  Mr. Patel, would you care to comment on anything with alleged violation three with Mr. Vivlo?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4121.561">Oh,</a>  so I would like to make one comment where he mentioned that like, Metro Buying Spirit since he was 15, he was still been buying alcohol since he was 15 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4131.487">And</a>  I believe a similar comment on incident number one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4136.27">So</a>  we took over the Metro Buying Spirit last, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4140.503">October</a>  or September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4142.484">And</a>  I know the prior owner had a lot of run-ins with these kind of instances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4149.446">And</a>  I think because of that reason, he kind of lost a lot of sales and went bankrupt almost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4156.508">So</a>  I just wanted to be there on the record that we took over ownership of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4161.978">I</a>  believe October 2023, if it's September or October, I can't recall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4169.784">And</a>  we didn't know that MetraMining Spirit was famous, I guess, among MetraMining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4177.77">We</a>  didn't know until this report, and now we're going to take even more stricter rules and policies and procedures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4190.399">But</a>  yeah, so that's <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4191.743">Everything's</a>  fine by me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4195.906">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4207.853">Just</a>  clarifying something?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4209.073">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4209.494">Incident</a>  two and three, so they happened on November 8th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4213.516">No,</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4215.157">And</a>  then after incident, after the first incident, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4218.692">with</a>  the five students in the car, that blurry ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4223.055">Did</a>  anybody talk to the store?</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4225.436">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4227.338">No,</a>  I did not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4228.698">Okay,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4229.559">I</a>  went back and sat down and marked it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4231.66">Yeah,</a>  gotcha.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4234.662">And</a>  then it was after the second one where the guy had to get... So when the second incident was a little bit different, obviously.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4241.687">Yeah,</a>  for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4243.368">It</a>  was potential that night that there were going to be criminal charges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4246.51">It</a>  was potential he was going to be arrested. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4251.802">I</a>  don't want to get into his history, but another officer, I'm very familiar with him, so is the other officer who was working with him and his family on lots of issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4260.37">So</a>  the decision was made that night not to file any criminal charges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4265.514">But</a>  because of what transpired, I needed to go into the store, I needed to look into it further, I needed to see that video right then and there because of the possibility of taking criminal action.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4277.195">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4277.735">And</a>  close at 11? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4279.155">That's</a>  when it closes.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4280.236">11</a>  p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4280.336">So</a>  when was what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4281.056">10</a>  past 10 and when was quarter 11? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4285.277">8.10</a>  and I think 8.45. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4286.077">8.10</a>  and 8.45. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4286.377">And</a>  then that was it for me from that's why it's very steady.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4291.198">I</a>  just went on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4306.509">observations</a>  all of them.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4307.63">Okay,</a>  Mr. Farhan Patel, did you like, did you wish to comment on the alleged violations? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4319.201">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4375.857">It's</a>  another clarifying question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4377.678">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4377.978">And</a>  then so, so then November 9th, we had a meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4382.801">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4383.641">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4384.162">A</a>  full meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4384.942">Would</a>  you like me to go into the meeting on the 9th?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4390.565">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4391.245">So</a>  you guys are all set as far as questions for the alleged third violation, correct?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4395.828">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4396.288">It's</a>  just, so that's the 8th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4398.429">Those</a>  two are the 8th and you put the new system in on the 9th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4401.171">On</a>  the morning of the 9th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4403.092">Morning</a>  of the 9th.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4407.343">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4408.164">No,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4409.384">That's</a>  what we're here for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4410.965">Once</a>  we're done with all the questions on the alleged third violation, then Officer Smith is welcome to read the summary, which is where you left off, but Ben, take your time.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4423.212">No,</a>  no, no, I guess those... I think I'm clear on those three ones, so... Okay.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4435.757">Um,</a>  officer Smith, if you care to read the summary, um, which is continuing it at the end of the evening, I returned to the method police station. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4444.402">It's</a>  in the middle of page three, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4449.345">Just</a>  to back up one second, one paragraph. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4452.506">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4454.778">When</a>  I finished the third incident, Mr. Rakesh Patel, who was the fourth, I mean, then contacted Mr. Karen Patel, and we scheduled a meeting for the following day, 3.30, because we wanted to address this right away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4469.585">At</a>  the end of the evening, I returned to the Medford Police Station. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4472.346">The</a>  two 12-packs of Nicole Valter and a bottle of T-Dogus vodka were disposed of in the trash barrel at the Medford Police Station. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4478.449">Seized</a>  products, will and driver's licenses will be destroyed at the conclusion of today's administrative hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4485.3">So</a>  on the following day at approximately 3.30 p.m., I traveled to Medford-Wyden Spheres and spoke with Mr. Rakesh Patel and Mr. Karen Patel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4494.945">I</a>  explained the entirety of my investigation and showed them the fraudulent driver's licenses from the night prior and from the first incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4502.449">Mr.</a>  Karen Patel explained after receiving the phone call last evening, he ordered an ID scanner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4509.292">an</a>  ID visor, smart V2 ID scanner, and a manual for identifying fraudulent IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4515.276">They</a>  also said they were purchasing black lights, ultraviolet lights, and books. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4522.741">They</a>  were all in order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4523.922">So</a>  when I went in on the 9th, he showed me the Amazon receipts that he purchased them, and they were to arrive on the 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4532.929">So</a>  they were going to be installed, and they were installed on the 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4535.07">On</a>  the 9th, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4539.06">He</a>  explained that after receiving that phone call, and when they opened up the following day, himself and Mr. Rakesh would tell them that they downloaded an app to their phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4548.908">So</a>  check IDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4550.489">And</a>  that's what they were going to use for the in-between until the new system arrived. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4554.732">I</a>  wasn't aware of that they already had a system at the registry that they had been using. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4559.516">I</a>  wasn't aware of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4562.178">Overall,</a>  I think we had a very positive meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4565.612">They</a>  were very merciful to sell it to persons under 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4568.533">And</a>  they took the necessary steps by buying it, purchasing a new ID scan of the books, the ultraviolet lights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4578.817">These</a>  are things that all should have been done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4581.458">I</a>  mean, yeah, they own another business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4583.138">They</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4583.698">They</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4584.459">They</a>  went and opened a store in 23. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4586.419">Especially</a>  after the first incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4589.42">But</a>  I'm glad they took the necessary steps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4591.841">Those</a>  steps were completed before I even walked in the door. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4595.4">on</a>  the night they made the purchase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4598.181">I</a>  saw the Amazon receipts, and I know they will put in place on the 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4602.083">Because</a>  on the 10th, I started, Mr. Garen Patel started sending me emails of all these pictures of the IDs that they're sharing, because the system was actually, well, it worked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4610.667">It</a>  worked, and I went down and collected those IDs, and the new system seems to be working very well to prevent this from happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4617.53">But</a>  overall, we had a very positive meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4620.771">They</a>  were remorseful for what transpired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4623.927">And</a>  that's essentially the summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4627.549">Okay,</a>  very good.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4633.894">Mr.</a>  Patel, do you have any comments on the summary of the police report on what</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4644.274">So</a>  I would like to just add one point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4648.036">One</a>  of my family members in New York, he owns a liquor store and he had a similar kind of experience with underage teenagers with fake IDs and those investigations wouldn't lead to anywhere. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4662.304">And</a>  so what they ended up doing, partnering with the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4666.892">City</a>  Hall and the police department, they come up with a strategy, if you will, implementing a $1,000 fine to the teenager who carries the fake ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4677.52">Because</a>  we can go on and on about catching this fake ID, confiscating, forwarding to the police department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4686.946">But</a>  if it's not going to lead to any penalties to the teenager carrying the IDs, it's like they're not <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4696.066">under</a>  pressure of not carrying the pay guide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4699.127">They</a>  just don't care, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4701.227">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4701.487">So</a>  if we implement, like if the Metricity implements some sort of guidelines, like first incident, second incident, they're like, there is a $1,000, $5,000 fee fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4715.229">And</a>  if we forward the teenager information to the police department, they're able to enforce those fines on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4725.947">that</a>  will reduce the teenager carrying the fraudulent ID in the first place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4731.748">We're</a>  going to be doing everything in our power. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4734.508">We</a>  order a second system that's better, but sometimes that's still not 100% of that I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4742.13">So</a>  yeah, that's my personal comments.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4745.11">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we can take that under advisement and refer it to our legal department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4750.171">I'm</a>  not sure if that's quite legal for us to do that without checking with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4756.858">There</a>  is language, I believe, in 138 Mass General Laws that the store can be fined up to $2,000 for selling to a miner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4772.543">You</a>  know, I'm not, I'd have to really dig into it to see if there was any language in there for the minors, but it's something we can refer to our legal department and, you know, check that.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4784.531">Officer,</a>  can you comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4785.952">So</a>  on the police side of things, I've discussed this at length with Lieutenant Walkowicz, and we seem to be in agreement of progressive discipline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4794.437">So</a>  all of these people that we've interacted with, it's almost like one bite of the apple, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4800.101">If</a>  there is a, this happens again, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4802.48">then</a>  we will take criminal charges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4804.101">This</a>  will go through the court system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4805.461">There</a>  will be penalties of some sort, but they've all been advised of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4809.503">So,</a>  but for this instance, we decided, you know, we'll explain the ramifications to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4816.246">And</a>  then going forward, if this happens again, then we're going to take the criminal side of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4821.549">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4822.409">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4823.069">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4823.469">And</a>  that's basically what the verdict was when you appeared before us in June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4830.13">that</a>  we held a one day suspension in abidance for a year, meaning if you violate it again, then you get that one year suspension for that previous check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4844.741">And</a>  that was a servant to another age group, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4848.504">Yeah,</a>  it was the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4850.645">I'd</a>  like to ask one question is the clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4856.73">His</a>  name is Rakesh. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4861.027">Is</a>  he still working there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4862.809">Is</a>  he, I mean, he was one, you know, he was the same one that sold to the miner back in June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4871.855">And</a>  Mr. Caron was also informed to abuse, got certified and obviously didn't either learn anything from it or just disregarded the respect for the law that, you know, you're supposed to follow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4892.151">Is</a>  Mr. Rakesh still working for you, folks, or is he going to be supervised by some sort? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4900.4">I</a>  mean, I know that you were going to be working with him until this machine came or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4906.967">It's</a>  just that, you know, I feel bad for you as an owner that, you know, because of this <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4916.312">you're</a>  going to have to pay the penalty on it, which is not really fair.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4921.795">That's</a>  what a business owner has to do when their employees don't follow the rules. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4927.197">And</a>  that's their, it's ultimately, they're the ones who make all the money, not their cash.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4933.2">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4933.54">It</a>  could come to a bit if they start to a minor and they wrap the car around a tree or they kill somebody.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4939.243">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4940.884">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4941.264">Then</a>  it's too late. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4942.244">Then</a>  it's too late.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4947.396">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4948.536">I</a>  also just want to share just my opinion, but I do think that the police, in this case, have done a very thorough job of following up on all of these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4957.878">And</a>  I mean, I'm sure those kids whose parents have been informed, I mean, gosh, I remember a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4966.079">I</a>  don't think if somebody's ID got taken a long time ago, growing up, there was no, you know, they've vanished. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4973.02">And</a>  I don't think the police were calling their parents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4975.661">I</a>  never heard of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4976.883">So</a>  I think he's very thorough, he's very proactive too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4979.545">And</a>  I, so I, I, you know, the fine thing, I don't even know what to say about that, but that's, that's really a step.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4986.929">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4987.35">I</a>  agree too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4988.63">Like,</a>  so like our story in Lowell, like, um, it's not the same level of help from the police department, so like Alex and Chris too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4996.575">So</a>  like, yeah, so respect is better, respect is due. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=4999.997">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5000.378">So</a>  I think they're, they're on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5003.78">Um,</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5005.928">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5007.649">Well,</a>  at this point, is there anybody else that I'd like to speak on behalf of or against or anything else to say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5018.377">Well,</a>  what we're going to do is we're going to deliberate for a short period of time, 10, 15 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5031.867">And</a>  so the three commissioners can <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5037.59">from</a>  testimony and we'll be back in and give you our decision.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5045.955">Okay,</a>  we have both the offices here as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5052.238">Get</a>  rid of these.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5054.079">Switch</a>  glasses, you're getting old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5057.801">Okay,</a>  these are the commission's findings for today's hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5067.792">Um,</a>  apparently this commission, we weren't taken seriously on July 17th with the compliance checks hearing that we had given you folks a one day suspension, uh, held in abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5083.3">And</a>  you understood at that time that if you violated again within a year that you were going to get a one day license suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5091.284">So</a>  that is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5095.605">going</a>  to be in effect starting tomorrow on 11-27. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5100.929">And</a>  as you seem to continue to disregard the law, especially after being TIP certified, the second offense that occurred on 11-1-24 will receive a two-day suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5122.477">that's</a>  going to be served 11, 29, 24, and 11, 30, 24. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5132.345">Violation</a>  of Mass General Law 138, section 34, sale of alcoholic beverage to minors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5141.051">After</a>  being notified by Sergeant Covino on 11, 124, that you're still sold alcoholic <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5153.707">on</a>  11A at 20 hundred hours to again sell alcoholic beverages to a minor violating Mass General Law 13834. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5166.013">That</a>  was Michael Bailey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5169.234">He</a>  was 19 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5171.995">And</a>  that became your third offense, which you will receive a three-day suspension for beginning 12-1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5181.141">24,</a>  12-2, 24, and 12-3, 24. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5188.424">45</a>  minutes later, on the 8th of November, you continued to disregard the law and sold to yet another minor, violating Mass General Law 138, Section 34, to Mr. Cameron Bibolo, 20 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5206.412">And</a>  that became your fourth offense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5212.806">which</a>  will be December 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5223.19">Mr.</a>  Patel, this is a total of 10 days suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5230.253">Your</a>  Section 15 alcoholic beverage license is going to be suspended, and that's beginning tomorrow through December 7th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5242.144">you</a>  may resume normal business hours of operation Sunday, December 8th of 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5249.05">You</a>  are to surrender your license from the premise and deliver it to Daria by 10 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5260.74">tomorrow</a>  morning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5265.103">Due</a>  to the fact that you purchased an ID scan, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5270.615">It</a>  shows that this commission, it shows this commission that you're trying to change your ways of doing business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5278.843">So</a>  we're going to mitigate the two violations you admitted to today on October 31st and November 2nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5298.683">You</a>  know, it's the tip certification course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5305.029">You're</a>  well aware that what the acceptable forms of IDs are for the state of Massachusetts and out-of-state licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5313.397">Even</a>  with this machine, if it doesn't pick it up, an out-of-state license is not acceptable in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5321.965">So</a>  you're doing that at your own risk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5325.087">I</a>  come in, you ID me, and I present you with an out-of-state license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5334.029">Obviously,</a>  I'm over 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5335.989">That's</a>  not going to be a problem for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5338.31">But</a>  if it's somebody that's questionable, that's a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5340.79">I</a>  don't know if your machine guarantees that you're not fraudulent or whatever, but it's not acceptable in Massachusetts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5355.355">You're</a>  also going to be required to have all employees TIP certified, and ID training classes that need to be completed within 60 days, and forward copies to DARIA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5371.442">The</a>  Mass Package Service Association can assist you with that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5386.436">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5391.818">Mr.</a>  Patel, as I stated at the last hearing you attended in July, this city and commission take these major offenses seriously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5403.303">One</a>  of these major offenses could have resulted in a tragedy or even a fatality, not only to the impaired body, but also to an innocent body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5415.288">With</a>  that said, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5416.682">Mr.</a>  Patel, as we go forward, if you should appear before this commission with another major offense, you could be facing an indefinite suspension or revocation of your license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5437.197">Do</a>  you understand what this commission has told you, Mr. Patel?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5440.679">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5443.811">Mr.</a>  Patel, do you have any questions pertaining to this license suspension?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5454.973">Would</a>  anyone else care?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5456.134">It's</a>  going to be</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5470.908">It's</a>  going to be starting tomorrow, 11-27-24, through 12-7-24. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5479.07">You</a>  may resume normal operation Sunday, 12-8-24.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5484.752">And</a>  so on Sunday, 12-8, we can't pick you up or license from the City Hall?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5492.494">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5492.954">I</a>  mean, obviously, we're closed here on Sunday, but you'll be authorized to sell alcoholic beverages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5500.935">on</a>  Sunday, the 8th, and just come by to pick up your license on Monday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5510.353">Yep,</a>  those are the dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5516.1">where</a>  you sell other items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5518.342">I</a>  don't know, you do lottery or any of that stuff, but that's totally up to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5523.686">You</a>  don't have to close the doors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5525.467">You</a>  just cannot sell any alcoholic beverages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5529.09">And</a>  if you do, that could lead to a whole nother set of problems that you really don't wanna get into. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5539.458">Okay,</a>  is there any other questions you have on the suspensions or this matter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5548.462">Would</a>  anyone else, police officers or commissioners care to comment? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5554.046">Chairman,</a>  is there a notification to the public of any signage? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5561.272">Yes,</a>  we did discuss that during deliberation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5565.876">We</a>  are definitely going to give them <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5570.77">signage</a>  to post in the windows and on the entry door, letting the public know that you are in violation and that's why you're closed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5578.152">We're</a>  not closed, but unable to sell alcohol beverages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5582.433">We</a>  just have to look into the wording on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5587.094">And</a>  if we have it ready by tomorrow morning, Daria can provide it with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5592.976">If</a>  not, we'll reach out to you and let you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5599.1">Okay,</a>  Commissioner Giraldo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5600.561">Do</a>  you have it in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5602.543">You're</a>  good?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5603.904">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5606.846">You</a>  do understand it's 10 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5608.307">It</a>  could have been a whole lot worse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5612.07">Believe</a>  me, this is why we took longer than 15 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5615.392">We</a>  kind of hashed it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5617.594">You</a>  know, we know that we purchased the package store on the 23rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5622.817">So</a>  the SINs before the SINs we counted against you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5628.578">the</a>  word is out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5629.699">So,</a>  um, so take this and there'll be a learning moment for all of us, especially where you guys, your whole family is in the, you know, you guys know backwards and forwards, but this could have been a lot worse because if you just, you knew the penalties, it could have been easily among either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5651.248">So,</a>  but like I said, we, we try to be pro business, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5655.849">At</a>  the end of the day, no one was seriously injured. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5658.53">Law</a>  enforcement had made sure parents, everybody was aware of it and spoke with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5665.131">So</a>  it's kind of one of the few reasons why we're not really throwing the book at you, so to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5672.453">So,</a>  like I said, take this, learn from it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5676.293">We</a>  don't want to see you again for this violation because it's not going to be pretty if we see you again for this violation, okay?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5684.654">Just</a>  as a point of reference with Commissioner Matarana saying in the city of Medford rules and regulations, guidelines on disciplinary sanctions or defense major suspension, 30 days to revocation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5701.423">So</a>  technically we should have given you 30 days today as a maximum, but we took into consideration what are you doing to better your business? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5710.807">What</a>  are you doing to improve this issue? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5713.369">Unfortunately,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5718.016">that</a>  goes along with the territory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5721.101">But</a>  I'm sorry, I don't mean to... No, no, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5726.008">Okay,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5732.548">Yeah,</a>  and are we going to get the instruction on the ID training within 60 days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5738.553">Within</a>  60 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5739.814">We</a>  get that from, is it?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5741.596">Yeah,</a>  what you want to do is, you know what the TIPS training is, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5745.559">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5745.94">So</a>  any of your employees at this store need to be TIPS certified and a copy of their TIPS certifications should be sent to DAPR. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5758.01">Also,</a>  it's something called <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5760.549">ID</a>  training class. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5762.992">And</a>  if you get in contact with the Massachusetts Package Store Association, are you familiar with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5772.462">They</a>  will tell you where you can go and have that training for all of your employees as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5778.828">If</a>  there's a certificate that comes with <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5782.738">we're</a>  not certified.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5784.442">Would</a>  you provide the copy of that instruction like either tomorrow when we come drop off the license so that</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5792.216">I</a>  don't know if that's going to be ready yet with you, Daria, but she's super busy with our... Yeah, or you can email it to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5803.519">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5805.68">So</a>  I don't forget.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5806.821">No,</a>  we'll give you a detailed report of what the violations are and what the dates are and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5815.103">But</a>  you know the gist of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5816.844">from</a>  tomorrow through the 8th, through the 7th, reopening on the 8th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5826.809">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5829.11">That</a>  concludes this hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5830.991">I</a>  make a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5832.952">Second</a>  motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5834.353">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5835.273">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5836.954">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5838.755">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, D.I. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-26-24&start=5840.376">7th,</a>  meeting's adjourned.</p>
