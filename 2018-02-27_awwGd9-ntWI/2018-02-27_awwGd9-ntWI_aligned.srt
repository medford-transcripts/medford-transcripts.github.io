1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,971
A standing ovation of gratitude for embattled Superintendent Roy Belson.

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:17,335
The 50 year veteran educator will retire on April 30th, two months early after waiting two months to tell police and parents about a loaded gun magazine found in a middle school auditorium.

3
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:23,477
Want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.

4
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:27,199
There are people in the community who obviously were concerned, and so I respect that.

5
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:32,941
There's a certain element of people that have certain political agendas, and I understand that.

6
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:38,984
But we'll move forward, and in time, everything will heal.

7
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,025
Frustrations boiled over last Thursday at a community meeting.

8
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:45,127
Parents livid that safety protocols weren't followed.

9
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:48,328
Tonight, students demanded a voice in their own safety.

10
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,770
We want our leaders to be proactive and to listen to us.

11
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:02,537
and to be truthful to us and not to go about what students perceive as the Medford way, backroom deals and talking behind our backs.

12
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:06,760
And the school committee has green-lighted other protocols to make schools safer.

13
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,422
We will move forward on ALICE training.

14
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:13,806
We will establish a school safety advisory committee.

15
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:27,028
And another school policy that takes effect immediately, anyone who finds any item on school grounds that could potentially pose a safety risk must call and report that immediately to police.

16
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,410
We're live in Medford tonight.

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,132
I'm Mary Saladna, WCVB News Center 5.
