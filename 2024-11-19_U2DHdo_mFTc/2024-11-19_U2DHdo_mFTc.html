    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=894.85s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=896.231s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=897.452s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=898.373s">Councilor</a>  Marks, I didn't get every one of your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=902.156s">I</a>  can read back what I have, and you can give me what I don't have, if that works for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=911.642s">First</a>  one I have is, is the administration working from a list? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=915.243s">Second</a>  one is, what percentage is being done, what percentage of the sidewalks are being done from the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=922.244s">With</a>  this 500,000, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=923.685s">Okay,</a>  with this 500,000, hang on. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=930.866s">Next</a>  one I have is, is there a priority list? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=934.207s">And</a>  the final one I have is, when will the work take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=937.528s">You</a>  hit them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=938.468s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=939.283s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=939.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=940.483s">And</a>  you want that as a question to the administration or as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=946.246s">However,</a>  I mean, if you could do it either way, it doesn't matter to me.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=950.407s">Why</a>  don't we, if you wouldn't mind, Councilor Rhoads, why don't we offer those as amendments from you? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=954.889s">You'll</a>  have an amendment, Vice President Caraviello as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=957.57s">Is</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=957.89s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=958.731s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=959.651s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=961.612s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=963.092s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=965.516s">I,</a>  uh, when I first saw this, I was a little alarmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=968.222s">I</a>  said, well, $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=969.224s">I</a>  said that this is, uh, this is, you know, it's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=973.674s">you</a>  know, Groundhog Day all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=975.675s">And</a>  I think that one of the things I made a motion for in the past few years of budget time is looking to see it incorporate a full-time cement sidewalk and pothole crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=986.499s">And</a>  because we keep on putting money into these bonds, into these type of payments for contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=994.862s">When</a>  I did talk to the <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=997.663s">the</a>  director of DPW, Mr. Cairns, he did inform me that this is something that we did talk in phases and he refreshed my memory about where this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1009.647s">The</a>  company for Council Marks, the company is already in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1013.889s">They</a>  already have the, there is a list, they're working off that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1018.531s">They're</a>  already in. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1019.752s">This</a>  will just have them continue what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1024.075s">So</a>  there is a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1025.736s">They</a>  have their feet already, their boots on the ground, ready to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1029.759s">And</a>  as soon as this is approved, the money's there, they will then follow through and continue with the sidewalk projects that were in place when we first initiated this process with the last regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1044.19s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1048.493s">wish</a>  somebody was here to talk to us, but I think that, you know... <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1055.177s">I</a>  also want to piggyback with what future resolution that's in, that Councilor Beaz is in, that we really need to know what our funding is going to look like after this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1067.146s">So,</a>  but again, I think that what Mr. Karens did tell me when I did my homework, he did say, George, this is something that we've already proved, brought me back to the place where we did prove this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1079.196s">And</a>  this is, he was a little confused at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1082.315s">because</a>  it was broken up into two payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1085.077s">But</a>  the contract was awarded, I believe, Adam, for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1088.82s">It</a>  was a two-year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1090.522s">So</a>  that's what Mr. Cairns told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1092.243s">So</a>  again, I know that Councilor Knight has something to offer maybe, and we can revisit this next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1099.088s">But</a>  I hope that helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1102.451s">But</a>  that's the conversation I had with Mr. Cairns today.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1105.172s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1106.293s">I</a>  just received a note that actually Aleesha Nunley was supposed to be with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1110.216s">She's</a>  not feeling well, but I believe the chief of staff is going to join us maybe in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1115.459s">So</a>  let's keep the conversation going. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1118.481s">I</a>  know there are a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1120.142s">So</a>  Councilor Morell is up next and Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1123.805s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1124.705s">Yeah,</a>  just echoing a lot of my fellow councilors questions and thank you to Councilor Scarpelli for providing that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1130.679s">Just</a>  some basic questions related to this that I think the administration can easily address. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1135.723s">I'm</a>  curious, it's phase three out of how many phases, and understanding, will there be another request for money? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1142.569s">Is</a>  that going to be the next fiscal year? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1144.771s">Does</a>  this $500,000, when does that carry us to a future request? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1149.636s">Is</a>  this it? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1150.236s">So</a>  simple questions that the administration can address when the chief of staff comes on or when we revisit this.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1159.647s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1160.908s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1162.709s">Yeah,</a>  just quickly to add to what my fellow councilors have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1166.311s">I</a>  think I would just like to know, can we continue at the $500,000 level? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1171.753s">You</a>  know, what is the impact relative to the, of the COVID-19 crisis on our finances and how does this fit into that picture?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1178.357s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1182.519s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1186.026s">Any</a>  other questions from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1188.568s">Anybody</a>  have questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1189.909s">Anybody</a>  have a question they'd like to ask?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1191.431s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1196.695s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1198.717s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to report the questions out to the administration for an answer so that we can address the people next week.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1206.604s">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1217.835s">That's</a>  an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1218.876s">If</a>  we do, uh, if I may, uh, do we know if the chief of staff is going to be joining us?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1225.56s">I</a>  just, I just sent him a text. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1227.301s">Cause</a>  he said he was going to be on in 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1229.282s">I</a>  just sent him a text saying it would be great if you could join us, but I haven't heard back from him on that text yet.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1236.206s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1236.766s">Commercial</a>  break and after these messages, they'll be right back.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1242.45s">Do</a>  we have any emails on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1244.271s">I</a>  don't believe so.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1249.007s">We</a>  have no emails on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1253.029s">I</a>  don't have all of Councilor Morell's question if she wants that as part of the council records.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1258.892s">Yes,</a>  so I was just seeing, it's, I believe, I mean, it being called phase three, I just got from the fellow councilors, so understanding what the phase is, and when does this, is there, are we anticipating another request? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1273.54s">Is</a>  this the final request of something like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1279.328s">Yeah,</a>  I think those two cover it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1282.791s">Okay,</a>  and the council bears had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1285.734s">What</a>  is the COVID-19 impact on the city finances?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1289.358s">How</a>  does this fit into that conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1292.881s">Or</a>  what might we need to pare back from $500,000 to a smaller amount?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1311.185s">Let</a>  me know when you have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1313.046s">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1314.707s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1316.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1318.648s">We</a>  have a subcommittee of public works and a schedule coming up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1324.37s">Maybe</a>  this is something that we can discuss there. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1327.411s">And</a>  also, if Mr. Kearns can come, we could take into consideration Councilor Scarpelli's motion about putting on a crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1337.916s">I</a>  mean, it's something that I, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1339.335s">that</a>  supported in past years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1340.576s">But</a>  again, maybe during that subcommittee meeting, whenever it happens, this issue can be talked about so we don't have to continue going out for $500,000 every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1354.187s">I</a>  mean, this is something I think I've ordered almost every year that I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1358.251s">So</a>  I think it's time that maybe we move on and actually look into really getting a crew getting started on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1369.224s">Thank</a>  you, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1369.924s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1373.306s">Clerk</a>  Urnabes. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1375.108s">Dave</a>  Rodriguez just said he got on and I'm going to unmute him right now.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1378.59s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1379.83s">Chief</a>  of Staff Rodriguez, good evening.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1383.913s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1384.753s">Thank</a>  you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1385.534s">I</a>  apologize that I wasn't on earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1387.857s">No</a>  worries.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1389.258s">Thank</a>  you for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1390.718s">There</a>  are a number of questions asked by Councilors regarding the loan order for the citywide sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1397.8s">I'm</a>  not sure if you want to read the questions maybe one by one to the Chief of Staff and he can take a shot at answering them.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1405.383s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1409.755s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello has asked if the mayor and Commissioner Currens will look into the pilot program to repair the sidewalks for less money than it costs to replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1423.518s">Apparently</a>  there was a negotiation with Malden at some point, and Vice President Caraviello wanted to know if Medford had reached any kind of agreement with Malden.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1436.663s">I</a>  have not heard about the negotiations with Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1438.685s">I</a>  can look into that and get some further information. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1442.108s">The</a>  500,000 that's before the council tonight is actually to backfill an existing contract that was begun last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1450.675s">So</a>  in order for us to change gears like that, I'd have to look into that from a procurement standpoint because there is an existing contract in place with a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1459.442s">So</a>  I can certainly look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1461.646s">And</a>  I certainly would like to get some more information regarding the negotiation with Malden and see what the details of that are all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1469.658s">So</a>  I can look into that for you, sir.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1474.794s">or</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1476.235s">If</a>  I can play a bit for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1478.557s">David,</a>  I was on the email chain with Commissioner Karens and the company that we had brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1485.322s">And</a>  the company had reached some type of agreement with Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1489.985s">And</a>  they were looking to come over here to Medford to stop, maybe to try some sidewalks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1495.929s">I</a>  don't know where that conversation with Commissioner Karens went. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1499.692s">But</a>  maybe if you can look into that and see if that ever came to fruition.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1504.683s">certainly</a>  will.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1505.645s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1510.255s">These</a>  next several are from Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1513.522s">The</a>  first one is the administration working from a list.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1518.647s">A</a>  list that isn't currently in development. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1520.869s">So</a>  we are undergoing a pavement management indexing program through the engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1525.552s">We're</a>  utilizing chapter 90 money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1528.335s">So</a>  last that I had spoken with the city engineer, Tim McGivern, the scope of services for those for that was currently being put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1536.361s">We</a>  have been a little bit sidetracked regarding the current crisis and a lot it's been all hands on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1543.005s">even</a>  in engineering, especially with the work safety plans that have been put into place regarding horizontal construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1549.108s">Engineering</a>  has been doing a lot of work ensuring the security of those work safety plans and making sure workers and <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1555.369s">the</a>  ancillary services are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1557.171s">I</a>  will follow up with Tim, figure out exactly where the payment management index programming is, and if a vendor has been secured through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1565.399s">There</a>  was a couple of questions about conflicts and some other folks that we had currently on call, but I will follow up with Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1571.846s">I</a>  can answer that question offline, or if you wanted to, I can come back at the next meeting and address it then.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1582.673s">This</a>  next one is related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1585.335s">If</a>  there is a list, what percentage of the work is being done from that list with this $500,000?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1596.32s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1597.32s">I</a>  certainly don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1598.04s">I'd</a>  have to check and see what the scope of work is, but I can check on that for you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1602.222s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1604.103s">Another</a>  question from Council Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1606.164s">Is</a>  there a priority list?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1609.119s">That</a>  would be, that would be set by the payment indexing. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1611.7s">That's</a>  not where streets would get done first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1613.62s">Final</a>  question from Council Marks, there's a couple more from Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, but the final one from Councilor Marks, when will the work take place?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1621.943s">It'll</a>  begin as soon as the construction season begins, is set to begin immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1626.404s">So</a>  it's ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1628.745s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1629.025s">Councilor</a>  Morell, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1633.687s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1635.425s">Just</a>  if I could, because I know some of my other colleagues expressed concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1640.327s">Over</a>  the last several years, these particular requests for sidewalk repairs have been pretty consistent, as Council Vice President Caraviello mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1651.252s">And</a>  the consistent question back from the council has been, what is the list we're working from? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1657.975s">Because</a>  that's always been a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1661.174s">And</a>  I think members that have served for a number of years were never able to get a working list of what sidewalks are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1670.961s">Are</a>  they prioritized? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1673.901s">And</a>  then to accomplish some of the goals, I think, like Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears mentioned, is that when you hear phases, you assume that at some point this will be over, this phase one, phase two and phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1686.892s">However,</a>  since I've been on the council, it's never had an end and there's never been an end game. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1693.757s">And</a>  I'm glad that we have a new administration now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1696.82s">So</a>  I think these are important questions that we know what the list is, what is comprised of, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1703.822s">and</a>  what we're going to get for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1706.265s">I</a>  realize we're in the second half of a contract, but that way it'll give us an understanding that, you know, after we do this phase, there's another phase, or this is the last phase, and then everything coming in will be new requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1723.302s">We've</a>  yet to get that over the years, and that's extremely vital so we can get a handle on it, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1730.544s">You</a>  know, we probably could have hired three, four, five people with equipment and a crew to do it internally and get much more bang for our buck by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1740.107s">However,</a>  we're at where we are right now, but I think moving forward, you know, I think we have to get these answers so we can make a financial decision that's good for this community and good for the taxpayers.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1752.985s">And</a>  certainly, and that was among the first conversations that the mayor had on her first day at office was, where are we with payment management? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1760.607s">How</a>  do we do this the right way? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1762.268s">How</a>  do we rank these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1763.328s">How</a>  do we make sure that the worst streets and sidewalks get done first? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1766.429s">And</a>  you're 100% correct that it is consistently a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1770.15s">And</a>  I'd hesitate to say that it's phasing because we're always gonna be chasing bad streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1775.312s">They're</a>  always gonna be in a state of disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1777.412s">And</a>  it's one of the constant sources of maintenance that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1779.973s">It's</a>  why chapter 90 money is so vital for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1782.854s">to</a>  be able to use on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1783.755s">So</a>  as long as we can rank them, get the worst streets done first, help work with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1787.677s">There's</a>  always emergencies that have to get done, but we're gonna try to use a scientific method and use a data-driven approach in order to index these things to make sure that the worst streets get done first and we're addressing the needs as we need to.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1803.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1803.586s">And</a>  just one last point, if I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1806.107s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1806.988s">Not</a>  to belabor this, but because when you talk sidewalks, most people think, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1811.477s">Oh,</a>  it's the replacement of a sidewalk panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1814.458s">But</a>  many times the work goes into curbing, goes into the removal of tree stumps because they may be the hindrance why you can't put a sidewalk and there may be a catch basin that's located near the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1828.325s">And</a>  that starts to expand the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1831.806s">And</a>  before you know it, rather than doing 500 panels or sidewalk panels, you're doing 50 with other related work. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1841.558s">These</a>  are the questions I think that we have to have answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1844.42s">And</a>  I know you can't tell sometimes until you get into a situation and say it involves much more than we anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1851.305s">But</a>  these are the type of things we have to know because 500,000 sounds like a lot, but when you start to do work, it doesn't go very far at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1859.991s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1864.01s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1865.652s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, if you would like to continue with the questions that were asked.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1869.035s">Two</a>  more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1870.497s">This</a>  one is from Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1872.379s">She</a>  asked about phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1874.26s">She</a>  wants an understanding of what phase three is, and do we anticipate another request for funding for sidewalk repairs?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1881.937s">I</a>  think the phase three is just for this contract, but I can get the exact information on that for you in terms of, I'm not familiar with the term phase three as it was included within the order, but I can put my finger on it for you, make sure I get you that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1895.528s">It's</a>  not a problem.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1896.649s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1899.411s">Clerk</a>  Cardavis, would it be possible to pull the previous papers from phase one and phase two so our new councilors can see what we've done <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1910.035s">what</a>  we've appropriated and approved over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1913.517s">I</a>  know since I've been on, and I've only been on myself and Councilor Scarpelli have only been on for four years, but I think we, you know, we definitely approved two phases and, you know, we're closing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1925.145s">I</a>  think I want to say we're probably close to a million dollars now because I want to say the previous two were like at least 250, but I can be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1932.27s">I</a>  don't have the paperwork in front of me, but.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1934.311s">Yeah,</a>  we can take a look at that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1935.592s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1936.213s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1937.453s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1938.213s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think a lot of the questions, as we're trying to piecemeal get to an overview of this whole project, as Councilor Mark said. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1944.617s">So</a>  I think if there's another phase or something like this comes up again, just an overview would be really helpful in understanding what we're being asked to approve.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1955.743s">Clerk</a>  Hardin, did you have any more questions on the</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1959.079s">There</a>  is one from Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1963.602s">He</a>  can jump in or I can read it, whatever Councilor Bears prefers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1968.166s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1968.986s">Just,</a>  Dave, when discussions about this were happening, was there any discussion of whether we'll be able to do this given the coronavirus crisis and the impact on city finances?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1982.436s">There</a>  has been, and there's been a lot of talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1985.91s">Recently</a>  we have been on the phone with our financial advisors regarding the best way to borrow money, and the best way to structure, structure our borrowing going forward and this was determined that this was something that we would be able to afford in terms of the contracting in the existing contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2002.747s">Unfortunately</a>  Aleesha Nunley was unable to join us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2006.23s">But</a>  as soon as she's back on her feet, I can't get you a detailed financial analysis on this particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2012.474s">So</a>  it was a little unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2013.855s">We</a>  were hoping that Alicia would be able to join us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2016.437s">But</a>  as you know, she is under the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2018.578s">So</a>  as soon as we're able to get more detailed finances, we can get that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2022.361s">But</a>  this is certainly something that we think the city can afford.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2028.725s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2029.925s">David,</a>  if I may, for a minute.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2031.266s">So</a>  is the $500,000 coming from the capital budget?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2037.135s">No,</a>  it would be settled to bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2039.017s">It</a>  would be borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2040.238s">Okay,</a>  it's going to be borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2042.379s">We</a>  got it in the bond market for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2043.821s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2044.221s">Yes,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2044.741s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2048.204s">Any</a>  other questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2052.788s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2055.09s">Do</a>  we know what the bond rate is? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2057.552s">Our</a>  bond rate hasn't changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2058.773s">We</a>  do have a bonding bond rate meeting in the third week of May this year.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2064.052s">No,</a>  I mean the rate on the loan, the $500,000 loan that we're looking to.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2069.533s">It's</a>  a moving target. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2070.434s">So</a>  it'll be put up for competitive bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2072.914s">So</a>  the bond market is in flux right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2076.355s">So</a>  if I told you what the bond rate would be today, it could very well change tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2081.776s">So</a>  when these go out for sale, they will be out for competitive bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2086.317s">Our</a>  financial advisors have said <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2088.638s">Most</a>  recently, the bond market is starting to get more competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2092.882s">In</a>  the opening days of the economic issues that we're facing right now, it was not very good, and things were shifting over to the note market. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2101.31s">But</a>  the bond market has started to become more competitive, so rates are certainly more competitive right now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2107.584s">And</a>  who are our financial advisors, are these the same entities that we've been using in the past, or is this a new entity or a new consultant that's been brought in?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2114.97s">It's</a>  Hilltop. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2115.59s">Yeah,</a>  it's Hilltop. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2116.251s">It's</a>  the folks that we've had for the efforts used for years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2122.176s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2125.678s">While</a>  we have the Chief of Staff, have you looked at any other funding sources other than bonding?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2133.556s">So</a>  there's only, it would be extremely limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2135.277s">It's</a>  either free cash or bonding for this, for the amount of money that it is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2138.959s">Right,</a>  and we have what, at least four or five million in free cash or maybe even more?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2144.161s">I</a>  believe it's more, but that's certainly something that we'd want to preserve for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2150.224s">The</a>  bond market where it is right now is probably going to be our most favorable financial option for this particular kind of project.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2159.187s">And</a>  that decision's already been made.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2161.728s">That's</a>  when we proposed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2162.849s">That's</a>  why we proposed it as borrowing instead of a transfer from free cash.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2168.514s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2169.074s">Can</a>  you give us next time to just what we have out there for free cash?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2174.439s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2174.539s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2179.002s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2180.143s">Just</a>  along the same note, maybe what we have in bonding capacity as well.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2185.673s">Our</a>  bonding capacity is very robust. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2188.194s">So</a>  as a matter of law, we're allowed to borrow 5% on the equalized value of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2193.416s">And</a>  where I, the last time I saw our bond load, it was about $38 million, which is far below our debt limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2201.459s">So</a>  we're not really approaching that at this point.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2213.784s">What</a>  would the term, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2215.427s">of</a>  the loan B for the 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2217.788s">I</a>  believe 20.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2220.169s">I</a>  think 20 years is the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2222.95s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2330.275s">My</a>  intention was to take up both papers under suspension when I raised the motion.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2335.639s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2336.619s">You</a>  want to take the second paper from the mayor?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2339.741s">Yes,</a>  but yeah, community preservation papers.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2342.343s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2343.264s">20-319,</a>  the electronic delivery to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155 regarding the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2355.933s">Yeah,</a>  Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following on recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2366.08s">Number</a>  one, requesting the appropriation of $250,000 from the CPA Community Housing Reserve to the Action for Boston Community Development, ABCD for the ABCD Rental Assistance for Medford Residents Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2383.678s">Number</a>  two, requesting the appropriation of $20,000 from the CPA Community Housing Reserve to Housing Families Incorporated to provide rental assistance as part of the Pro Bono Legal Services Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2398.065s">All</a>  projects will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2403.108s">The</a>  category is Community Housing Reserve and General Reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2406.41s">Sincerely,</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2410.332s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2412.887s">The</a>  first question that I'd have, Mr. President, is whether or not these appropriations and programs that we're funding would service 100% Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2424.092s">Because</a>  community preservation funds are generated through an assessment on our property taxes, I think it's very important that we make sure that these funds stay within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2433.355s">So</a>  I ask that question.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2434.916s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2436.556s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2441.078s">Oh,</a>  Roberta. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2443.649s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2444.049s">Yeah,</a>  I can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2447.571s">We</a>  are required, but under fair housing federal fair housing law we cannot limit it strictly to only Medford residents however we can place a priority on Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2462.418s">and</a>  given the amount of need that's anticipated and the fact that other communities who are working with ABCD are also putting funds on the table, it's highly unlikely that Medford's funds will be utilized supporting residents of other communities, that these funds are very highly likely to go entirely to Medford residents.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2488.572s">Mr.</a>  President, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2491.034s">From</a>  the presentation, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2492.835s">Cameron</a>  referred to limit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2495.357s">And</a>  when you say limit it, limit what? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2497.499s">Limit</a>  the expenditure of CPA funds or restrict the expenditure of CPA funds under this program?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2509.896s">We</a>  cannot have housing pro publicly funded housing programs under federal fair housing law that are entirely restricted to residents of one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2524.614s">So</a>  the funds have to be applied in such a way that they allow for fair access to housing to people from, to all kinds of people who are protected classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2542.466s">Now,</a>  since Medford's population is already representative of protected classes under fair housing laws, Medford's, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2553.693s">The</a>  funds that Medford puts into programs like this, or any community preservation, or any publicly assisted housing, can very likely support Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2566.022s">And</a>  in the past, I've provided a worksheet showing what the <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2574.647s">who</a>  is supported by a local preference in housing programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2579.792s">So</a>  if we were to apply a local preference to Medford residents only, for example, the <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2587.244s">That</a>  would exclude people who, say, have roots in Medford but have been displaced already and then don't have the opportunity to move back to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2597.752s">So</a>  that's an issue with requiring people to be Medford residents already before they can benefit from <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2607.33s">from</a>  publicly funded housing programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2609.631s">In</a>  this instance, I believe that all of the units, that all of the residents who are going to be assisted are people who are already living in Medford because the type of assistance is emergency rental assistance for people who have come on hard economic times and are having difficulty being able to pay <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2634.745s">their</a>  rent and mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2635.946s">But</a>  I'd like to allow our applicants to speak to how the programs will work in their particular programs.</p>
