Order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law, Chapter 38, Section 20.

35
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:59,096
Whereas on March 10, 2020, I, Charles D. Baker, Governor of

36
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:15,763
Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting pursuant to the powers provided by Chapter 639 of the Acts of 1950 and Section 2A of Chapter 17 of the General Law, has declared that there now exists in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a state of emergency

37
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:22,048
due to the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19.

38
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:41,513
And whereas many important functions of state and local government are executed by public bodies, as the term is defined in general law chapter 30A, section 18, in meetings that are open to the public, consistent with the requirements of law and sound public policy, and in order to ensure active,

39
00:03:42,213 --> 00:04:05,432
public engagement with contribution to and oversight of the functions of government, and whereas both the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, DPH, have advised residents to take extra measures to put distance between themselves and other people to further reduce the risk of being exposed to COVID-19.

40
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:10,356
Additionally, the CDC and DPH have advised high-risk individuals

41
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:19,323

44
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,963
And whereas low-cost telephone, social media, and other internet-based technologies

45
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:54,914
are currently available that will permit the convening of a public body through virtual means and allow real-time public access to the activities of the public body.

46
00:04:55,235 --> 00:05:08,326
And whereas Section 20 of Chapter 30A in implementing regulations issued by the Attorney General currently authorize remote participation by members of a public body subject to certain limitations.

47
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,669
Now, therefore, I hereby order the following.

49
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:39,617

50
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:50,070

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,225

00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:26,080
or a local ordinance or bylaw pursuant to which the proceeding is conducted, any alternative means of public access must provide for such participation.

54
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,723
A municipal body

55
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:55,224
The municipal public body that, for reasons of economic hardship and despite best efforts, is unable to provide alternative means of public access that will enable the public to follow the proceedings of the municipal public body as those activities are occurring in real time, may instead post on its municipal website a full and complete transcript, recording, or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as practicable upon conclusion of the proceedings.

56
00:06:56,648 --> 00:07:07,774

57
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:16,999

April 16, 2020, to President John Falco and honorable members of the Memphis City Council.

Council on nine.

99
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,346
Mr. President, thank you very much.

100
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:42,119
If I do recall properly, I do believe this would be phase three of a three-year plan for sidewalk restoration that we have funded previously, but I may be mistaken.

101
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,765
I was hoping maybe there'd be a representative from the administration here to discuss a little bit further as to this loan order.

102
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:54,138
I was too, and actually, I don't think anyone is here with us tonight.

103
00:11:54,158 --> 00:12:03,000
I was thinking someone from the DPW or the chief of staff, but no one seems to be on the line from what I can tell.

104
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,661
I'm sorry, sorry.

105
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:10,442
Councilor Knight, did you make a motion?

106
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:13,383
I'll allow my other council colleagues to type it.

107
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,967
Okay, Vice President Caviello and then Councilor Marks.

108
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,168
Thank you, Mr. President.

109
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:34,801
Mr. President, if we could ask the administration if this $500,000 includes part of the pilot program that you and I had suggested back in January with the company that repairs the sidewalks for a third of the cost

110
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,022
of replacing some of them.

111
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:46,946
I know they would, I saw the email chain with Commissioner Kearns and the company, and I know they were doing some work in Malden this coming spring.

112
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:57,530
And if you can find out if they reached any kind of agreement to do some of that work here at Medford, hopefully we can defray some of that cost and get more work done.

113
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:26,864
uh for less money so we get a little bit better bank for a buck so if we if you can make that and uh form of a question to the administration in the dpw okay i got the motion vice president carabiello i i need more i i need to get that that uh amendment again or the uh the request again okay uh back in january uh president falco and myself uh requested that the mayor and the dpw look into a pilot program with a company that we

114
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:33,487
We gave them that repair sidewalks for less money than it does to replace them.

115
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:41,829
And, um, I saw that, uh, commissioner Karens, uh, had, had been talking to him because they were doing some work in Malden.

116
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:45,990
And I don't know if they ever came to an agreement to do some work in Medford.

117
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:49,591
So if you could ask if, uh, if that had come to fruition.

118
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:51,272
Okay.

119
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:52,821
Thank you.

120
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:53,782
Thank you.

121
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:56,484
We have Councilor Marks, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Morrell.

122
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:57,284
Councilor Marks.

123
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,306
Thank you, Mr. President.

124
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:17,678
For previous phases of the sidewalk improvements, this council has requested if the administration is working from a current list, if so, what percent of the list will be accomplished

125
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,592
through this 500,000.

126
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:23,093
So that was one of the questions that was asked in the past.

127
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:26,834
And I was asked that that be re-asked again, Mr. President.

128
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:33,757
Roughly how many sidewalks do they feel will be accomplished with this 500,000?

129
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:40,479
What priority, if there is an existing list, will the sidewalks be done?

130
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,280
Is there a priority list that is already established?

131
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,482
And when will the work

132
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:51,387
start to take place, assuming it's approved.

133
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,791
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

134
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:56,551
Thank you.

135
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:58,293
Councilor Scott Kelly.

136
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,736
Councilor Marks, I didn't get every one of your questions.

137
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:09,282
I can read back what I have, and you can give me what I don't have, if that works for you.

138
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:14,403
First one I have is, is the administration working from a list?

139
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:20,904
Second one is, what percentage is being done, what percentage of the sidewalks are being done from the list?

140
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:23,605
With this 500,000, correct?

141
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,605
Okay, with this 500,000, hang on.

142
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,127
Next one I have is, is there a priority list?

143
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:36,587
And the final one I have is, when will the work take place?

144
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:38,028
You hit them all.

145
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:38,748
Okay.

146
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:39,563
All right.

147
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,303
Thank you.

148
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,044
And you want that as a question to the administration or as an amendment?

149
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,707
However, I mean, if you could do it either way, it doesn't matter to me.

150
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,129
Why don't we, if you wouldn't mind, Councilor Rhoads, why don't we offer those as amendments from you?

151
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,550
You'll have an amendment, Vice President Carviello as well.

152
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:57,830
Is that?

153
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,390
That's fine.

154
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,531
Okay, thank you.

155
00:15:59,651 --> 00:15:59,991
Thank you.

156
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,072
Councilor Scarbelli.

157
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,133
Thank you, Council President.

158
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,102
I, uh, when I first saw this, I was a little alarmed.

159
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,164
I said, well, $500,000.

160
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:12,871
I said that this is, uh, this is, you know, it's like,

161
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,635
you know, Groundhog Day all over again.

162
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:25,818
And I think that one of the things I made a motion for in the past few years of budget time is looking to see it incorporate a full-time cement sidewalk and pothole crew.

163
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:34,161
And because we keep on putting money into these bonds, into these type of payments for contractors.

164
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:35,802
When I did talk to the

165
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:48,507
the director of DPW, Mr. Cairns, he did inform me that this is something that we did talk in phases and he refreshed my memory about where this is.

166
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:53,309
The company for Council Marks, the company is already in the city.

167
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,931
They already have the, there is a list, they're working off that list.

168
00:16:58,531 --> 00:16:59,392
They're already in.

169
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,635
This will just have them continue what they're doing.

170
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,716
So there is a list.

171
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:09,159
They have their feet already, their boots on the ground, ready to work.

172
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:24,130
And as soon as this is approved, the money's there, they will then follow through and continue with the sidewalk projects that were in place when we first initiated this process with the last regime.

173
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,151
So again,

174
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:33,667
wish somebody was here to talk to us, but I think that, you know...

175
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:47,106
I also want to piggyback with what future resolution that's in, that Councilor Beaz is in, that we really need to know what our funding is going to look like after this pandemic.

176
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:59,116
So, but again, I think that what Mr. Karens did tell me when I did my homework, he did say, George, this is something that we've already proved, brought me back to the place where we did prove this.

177
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:01,478
And this is, he was a little confused at the time,

178
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,317
because it was broken up into two payments.

179
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:08,140
But the contract was awarded, I believe, Adam, for two years.

180
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,021
It was a two-year project.

181
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,143
So that's what Mr. Cairns told me.

182
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:19,048
So again, I know that Councilor Knight has something to offer maybe, and we can revisit this next week.

183
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:22,371
But I hope that helped.

184
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,473
But that's the conversation I had with Mr. Cairns today.

185
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,253
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

186
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:30,175
I just received a note that actually Alicia Nunley was supposed to be with us tonight.

187
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:35,399
She's not feeling well, but I believe the chief of staff is going to join us maybe in a few minutes.

188
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,421
So let's keep the conversation going.

189
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,642
I know there are a number of questions.

190
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,924
So Councilor Morrell is up next and Councilor Beers.

191
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:44,685
Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:50,209
Yeah, just echoing a lot of my fellow councilors questions and thank you to Councilor Scarpelli for providing that information.

193
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,763
Just some basic questions related to this that I think the administration can easily address.

194
00:18:55,723 --> 00:19:02,289
I'm curious, it's phase three out of how many phases, and understanding, will there be another request for money?

195
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,711
Is that going to be the next fiscal year?

196
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:09,535
Does this $500,000, when does that carry us to a future request?

197
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,176
Is this it?

198
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:16,882
So simple questions that the administration can address when the chief of staff comes on or when we revisit this.

199
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:20,588
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

200
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:21,568
Councilor Beers?

201
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:26,251
Yeah, just quickly to add to what my fellow councilors have said.

202
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:31,693
I think I would just like to know, can we continue at the $500,000 level?

203
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:38,337
You know, what is the impact relative to the, of the COVID-19 crisis on our finances and how does this fit into that picture?

204
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,259
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

205
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,700
Any other questions from the council?

206
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,548
Any other questions from the public?

207
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:49,569
Anybody have questions?

208
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,411
Anybody have a question they'd like to ask?

209
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:54,974
Okay.

210
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,236
Counselor Knight.

211
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:06,583
Mr. President, motion to report the questions out to the administration for an answer so that we can address the people next week.

212
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:07,885
Let's see.

213
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:18,655
That's an idea.

214
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:25,139
If we do, uh, if I may, uh, do we know if the chief of staff is going to be joining us?

215
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,241
I just, I just sent him a text.

216
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:28,902
Cause he said he was going to be on in 10 minutes.

217
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:33,164
I just sent him a text saying it would be great if you could join us, but I haven't heard back from him on that text yet.

218
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:36,746
Okay.

219
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:42,409
Commercial break and after these messages, they'll be right back.

220
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,890
Do we have any emails on this?

221
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:44,951
I don't believe so.

222
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,048
We have no emails on this.

223
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:57,091
I don't have all of Councilor Morrell's question if she wants that as part of the council records.

224
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:13,460
Yes, so I was just seeing, it's, I believe, I mean, it being called phase three, I just got from the fellow councilors, so understanding what the phase is, and when does this, is there, are we anticipating another request?

225
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,961
Is this the final request of something like this?

226
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,329
Yeah, I think those two cover it.

227
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,753
Okay, and the council bears had a question.

228
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:28,457
What is the COVID-19 impact on the city finances?

229
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,260
How does this fit into that conversation?

230
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:38,847
Or what might we need to pare back from $500,000 to a smaller amount?

231
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,486
Let me know when you have that.

232
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:53,366
I got it.

233
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:55,607
Vice President Caviel.

234
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:56,867
Thank you, Mr. President.

235
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:03,570
We have a subcommittee of public works and a schedule coming up soon.

236
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,351
Maybe this is something that we can discuss there.

237
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:17,876
And also, if Mr. Kearns can come, we could take into consideration Councilor Scott Pelley's motion about putting on a crew.

238
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,636
I mean, it's something that I,

239
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,536
that supported in past years.

240
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:34,167
But again, maybe during that subcommittee meeting, whenever it happens, this issue can be talked about so we don't have to continue going out for $500,000 every year.

241
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:38,231
I mean, this is something I think I've ordered almost every year that I've been on the council.

242
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:47,759
So I think it's time that maybe we move on and actually look into really getting a crew getting started on this.

243
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:49,904
Thank you, Council.

244
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,345
Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

245
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:53,867
Clerk Urnabes.

246
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:58,109
Dave Rodriguez just said he got on and I'm going to unmute him right now.

247
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:58,910
Okay.

248
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,531
Chief of Staff Rodriguez, good evening.

249
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:04,713
Good evening, everyone.

250
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:05,494
Thank you for having me.

251
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:07,075
I apologize that I wasn't on earlier.

252
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:09,217
No worries.

253
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:10,178
Thank you for joining us.

254
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:17,300
There are a number of questions asked by Councillors regarding the loan order for the citywide sidewalks.

255
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,483
I'm not sure if you want to read the questions maybe one by one to the Chief of Staff and he can take a shot at answering them.

256
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:25,663
Sure.

257
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:42,878
Vice President Caraviello has asked if the mayor and Commissioner Currens will look into the pilot program to repair the sidewalks for less money than it costs to replace them.

258
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:54,020
Apparently there was a negotiation with Malden at some point, and Vice President Caraviello wanted to know if Medford had reached any kind of agreement with Malden.

259
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:58,665
I have not heard about the negotiations with Malden.

260
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,247
I can look into that and get some further information.

261
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:09,954
The 500,000 that's before the council tonight is actually to backfill an existing contract that was begun last year.

262
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:18,702
So in order for us to change gears like that, I'd have to look into that from a procurement standpoint because there is an existing contract in place with a contractor.

263
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,085
So I can certainly look into that.

264
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:29,478
And I certainly would like to get some more information regarding the negotiation with Malden and see what the details of that are all about.

265
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:30,700
So I can look into that for you, sir.

266
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:35,715
or President Caviello.

267
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:38,156
If I can play a bit for a second.

268
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:45,242
David, I was on the email chain with Commissioner Karens and the company that we had brought forward.

269
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:49,565
And the company had reached some type of agreement with Malden.

270
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:55,909
And they were looking to come over here to Medford to stop, maybe to try some sidewalks here.

271
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,352
I don't know where that conversation with Commissioner Karens went.

272
00:24:59,692 --> 00:25:03,955
But maybe if you can look into that and see if that ever came to fruition.

273
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:05,184
certainly will.

274
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,932
Thank you.

275
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,039
These next several are from Councilor Marks.

276
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:15,786
The first one is the administration working from a list.

277
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,849
A list that isn't currently in development.

278
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:25,512
So we are undergoing a pavement management indexing program through the engineering department.

279
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:27,574
We're utilizing chapter 90 money to do that.

280
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:35,660
So last that I had spoken with the city engineer, Tim McGivern, the scope of services for those for that was currently being put into place.

281
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:41,625
We have been a little bit sidetracked regarding the current crisis and a lot it's been all hands on deck.

282
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:49,048
even in engineering, especially with the work safety plans that have been put into place regarding horizontal construction.

283
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:54,710
Engineering has been doing a lot of work ensuring the security of those work safety plans and making sure workers and

284
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,770
the ancillary services are safe.

285
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:04,618
I will follow up with Tim, figure out exactly where the payment management index programming is, and if a vendor has been secured through that.

286
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:11,786
There was a couple of questions about conflicts and some other folks that we had currently on call, but I will follow up with Tim.

287
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:18,092
I can answer that question offline, or if you wanted to, I can come back at the next meeting and address it then.

288
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,134
This next one is related to that.

289
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:34,419
If there is a list, what percentage of the work is being done from that list with this $500,000?

290
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,620
I don't know.

291
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,000
I certainly don't know.

292
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,062
I'd have to check and see what the scope of work is, but I can check on that for you.

293
00:26:42,222 --> 00:26:43,523
Okay.

294
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,504
Another question from Council Marks.

295
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:47,225
Is there a priority list?

296
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,300
That would be, that would be set by the payment indexing.

297
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,060
That's not where streets would get done first.

298
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:01,183
Final question from Council Marks, there's a couple more from Councilor Morrell and Councilor Behrs, but the final one from Councilor Marks, when will the work take place?

299
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:05,924
It'll begin as soon as the construction season begins, is set to begin immediately.

300
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:07,665
So it's ready to go.

301
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:09,005
Okay.

302
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:12,106
Councilor Morrell, I have a question.

303
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:14,267
Councilor Marks.

304
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,087
Just if I could, because I know some of my other colleagues expressed concern.

305
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:29,831
Over the last several years, these particular requests for sidewalk repairs have been pretty consistent, as Council Vice President Carvello mentioned.

306
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:37,695
And the consistent question back from the council has been, what is the list we're working from?

307
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:40,336
Because that's always been a moving target.

308
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:50,481
And I think members that have served for a number of years were never able to get a working list of what sidewalks are on the list.

309
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,362
Are they prioritized?

310
00:27:53,901 --> 00:28:06,351
And then to accomplish some of the goals, I think, like Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beers mentioned, is that when you hear phases, you assume that at some point this will be over, this phase one, phase two and phase three.

311
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:13,037
However, since I've been on the council, it's never had an end and there's never been an end game.

312
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:16,119
And I'm glad that we have a new administration now.

313
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,005
So I think these are important questions that we know what the list is, what is comprised of,

314
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,864
and what we're going to get for the money.

315
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:42,321
I realize we're in the second half of a contract, but that way it'll give us an understanding that, you know, after we do this phase, there's another phase, or this is the last phase, and then everything coming in will be new requests.

316
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:50,104
We've yet to get that over the years, and that's extremely vital so we can get a handle on it, like Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned.

317
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:59,446
You know, we probably could have hired three, four, five people with equipment and a crew to do it internally and get much more bang for our buck by now.

318
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:12,170
However, we're at where we are right now, but I think moving forward, you know, I think we have to get these answers so we can make a financial decision that's good for this community and good for the taxpayers.

319
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:19,367
And certainly, and that was among the first conversations that the mayor had on her first day at office was, where are we with payment management?

320
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,808
How do we do this the right way?

321
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:23,288
How do we rank these things?

322
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,029
How do we make sure that the worst streets and sidewalks get done first?

323
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,550
And you're 100% correct that it is consistently a moving target.

324
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:35,292
And I'd hesitate to say that it's phasing because we're always gonna be chasing bad streets and sidewalks.

325
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:36,992
They're always gonna be in a state of disrepair.

326
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,913
And it's one of the constant sources of maintenance that we have to do.

327
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:42,014
It's why chapter 90 money is so vital for us.

328
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:43,715
to be able to use on that.

329
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:47,657
So as long as we can rank them, get the worst streets done first, help work with it.

330
00:29:47,677 --> 00:30:00,844
There's always emergencies that have to get done, but we're gonna try to use a scientific method and use a data-driven approach in order to index these things to make sure that the worst streets get done first and we're addressing the needs as we need to.

331
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:03,566
Thank you.

332
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,727
And just one last point, if I could, Mr. President.

333
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:06,547
Yes, please.

334
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:11,010
Not to belabor this, but because when you talk sidewalks, most people think,

335
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,658
Oh, it's the replacement of a sidewalk panel.

336
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:27,744
But many times the work goes into curbing, goes into the removal of tree stumps because they may be the hindrance why you can't put a sidewalk and there may be a catch basin that's located near the sidewalk.

337
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:31,326
And that starts to expand the scope of the project.

338
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:39,830
And before you know it, rather than doing 500 panels or sidewalk panels, you're doing 50 with other related work.

339
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,939
These are the questions I think that we have to have answered.

340
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:50,604
And I know you can't tell sometimes until you get into a situation and say it involves much more than we anticipated.

341
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:58,910
But these are the type of things we have to know because 500,000 sounds like a lot, but when you start to do work, it doesn't go very far at all.

342
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,231
So I just want to put that out there.

343
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,951
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

344
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:08,975
Clerk Hertoghez, if you would like to continue with the questions that were asked.

345
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:09,816
Two more questions.

346
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,778
This one is from Councilor Morrell.

347
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,220
She asked about phase three.

348
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:21,268
She wants an understanding of what phase three is, and do we anticipate another request for funding for sidewalk repairs?

349
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:35,508
I think the phase three is just for this contract, but I can get the exact information on that for you in terms of, I'm not familiar with the term phase three as it was included within the order, but I can put my finger on it for you, make sure I get you that information.

350
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:35,968
It's not a problem.

351
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:37,309
Okay, thank you.

352
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:49,159
Clerk Cardavis, would it be possible to pull the previous papers from phase one and phase two so our new councilors can see what we've done

353
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:53,437
what we've appropriated and approved over the last couple of years.

354
00:31:53,517 --> 00:32:05,125
I know since I've been on, and I've only been on myself and Councilor Scott Kelly have only been on for four years, but I think we, you know, we definitely approved two phases and, you know, we're closing in.

355
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:12,250
I think I want to say we're probably close to a million dollars now because I want to say the previous two were like at least 250, but I can be wrong.

356
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,631
I don't have the paperwork in front of me, but.

357
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,252
Yeah, we can take a look at that.

358
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:16,193
Okay, thank you.

359
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:16,793
Councilor Morrell.

360
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:18,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

361
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:24,577
Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the questions, as we're trying to piecemeal get to an overview of this whole project, as Councilor Mark said.

362
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:31,661
So I think if there's another phase or something like this comes up again, just an overview would be really helpful in understanding what we're being asked to approve.

363
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:38,145
Clerk Hardin, did you have any more questions on the

364
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,421
There is one from Councilor Behrs.

365
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:47,385
He can jump in or I can read it, whatever Councilor Behrs prefers.

366
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:48,906
Sure.

367
00:32:48,986 --> 00:33:00,455
Just, Dave, when discussions about this were happening, was there any discussion of whether we'll be able to do this given the coronavirus crisis and the impact on city finances?

368
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:04,638
There has been, and there's been a lot of talk about that.

369
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:21,426
Recently we have been on the phone with our financial advisors regarding the best way to borrow money, and the best way to structure, structure our borrowing going forward and this was determined that this was something that we would be able to afford in terms of the contracting in the existing contract.

370
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:25,350
Unfortunately Alicia Nunley was unable to join us tonight.

371
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:32,014
But as soon as she's back on her feet, I can't get you a detailed financial analysis on this particularly.

372
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:33,835
So it was a little unexpected.

373
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:35,776
We were hoping that Alicia would be able to join us on this.

374
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:38,498
But as you know, she is under the weather.

375
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:42,341
So as soon as we're able to get more detailed finances, we can get that for you.

376
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,982
But this is certainly something that we think the city can afford.

377
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:49,905
Okay.

378
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,106
David, if I may, for a minute.

379
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:53,828
So is the $500,000 coming from the capital budget?

380
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,997
No, it would be settled to bond.

381
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,158
It would be borrowed.

382
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,299
Okay, it's going to be borrowed.

383
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:03,741
We got it in the bond market for it.

384
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:04,201
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:04,681
Yes, you're right.

386
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:04,982
Okay.

387
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,345
Any other questions from the council?

388
00:34:12,788 --> 00:34:13,569
Oh, Councilor Knight.

389
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,131
Do we know what the bond rate is?

390
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:18,753
Our bond rate hasn't changed.

391
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:23,357
We do have a bonding bond rate meeting in the third week of May this year.

392
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:29,413
No, I mean the rate on the loan, the $500,000 loan that we're looking to.

393
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:30,414
It's a moving target.

394
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,194
So it'll be put up for competitive bond.

395
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:35,615
So the bond market is in flux right now.

396
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:40,936
So if I told you what the bond rate would be today, it could very well change tomorrow.

397
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:45,337
So when these go out for sale, they will be out for competitive bonding.

398
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,038
Our financial advisors have said

399
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:52,061
Most recently, the bond market is starting to get more competitive.

400
00:34:52,882 --> 00:35:00,450
In the opening days of the economic issues that we're facing right now, it was not very good, and things were shifting over to the note market.

401
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,075
But the bond market has started to become more competitive, so rates are certainly more competitive right now.

402
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:14,950
And who are our financial advisors, are these the same entities that we've been using in the past, or is this a new entity or a new consultant that's been brought in?

403
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,430
It's Hilltop.

404
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,211
Yeah, it's Hilltop.

405
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:19,614
It's the folks that we've had for the efforts used for years and years.

406
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:24,077
Okay, thank you very much.

407
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:31,243
While we have the Chief of Staff, have you looked at any other funding sources other than bonding?

408
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,257
So there's only, it would be extremely limited.

409
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:38,779
It's either free cash or bonding for this, for the amount of money that it is.

410
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:43,381
Right, and we have what, at least four or five million in free cash or maybe even more?

411
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:50,204
I believe it's more, but that's certainly something that we'd want to preserve for the future.

412
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:56,706
The bond market where it is right now is probably going to be our most favorable financial option for this particular kind of project.

413
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,468
And that decision's already been made.

414
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:02,749
That's when we proposed it.

415
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,093
That's why we proposed it as borrowing instead of a transfer from free cash.

416
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:09,034
Thank you.

417
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:13,918
Can you give us next time to just what we have out there for free cash?

418
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:14,519
Sure.

419
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,662
Any other questions?

420
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:19,663
Council Beers.

421
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:24,247
Just along the same note, maybe what we have in bonding capacity as well.

422
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,294
Our bonding capacity is very robust.

423
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:32,976
So as a matter of law, we're allowed to borrow 5% on the equalized value of the community.

424
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:41,039
And where I, the last time I saw our bond load, it was about $38 million, which is far below our debt limit.

425
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,280
So we're not really approaching that at this point.

426
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:46,661
Thanks.

427
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:48,982
Any other questions?

428
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:51,943
Oh God, it's all night.

429
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:54,624
What would the term,

430
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:57,228
of the loan B for the 500,000.

431
00:36:57,788 --> 00:36:59,188
I believe 20.

432
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:01,409
I think 20 years is the bond.

433
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,372
Thank you very much.

434
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:10,032
Any other questions?

435
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:17,455
Okay, the chair awaits a motion from the floor.

436
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,778
Motion to table, Mr. President, until we get answers from the administration.

437
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:24,758
Until next week.

438
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:31,670
Okay, on the motion of council marks the table until next week, so we can allow time to get some answers from the administration.

439
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,471
Second.

440
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:34,494
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

441
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:36,236
Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

442
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:41,923
Still writing it down, hang on just a second.

443
00:37:56,711 --> 00:38:01,312
That was Councilor Marks' motion to table for one week until there are answers from the administration.

444
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:03,013
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

445
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:03,773
You are correct.

446
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,834
Okay, to table for one week.

447
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:07,894
Councilor Behrs?

448
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:09,135
Yes.

449
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:10,775
Vice President Caravaglia?

450
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:12,536
Yes.

451
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:13,836
Councilor Knight?

452
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:14,777
Yes.

453
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:16,077
Councilor Marks?

454
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:17,057
Yes.

455
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:18,198
Councilor Morrell?

456
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:18,958
Yes.

457
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:20,198
Councilor Scarpelli?

458
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:20,999
Yes.

459
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,099
President Falco?

460
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,042
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

461
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:27,122
The motion has been tabled till next week.

462
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:45,268
We want to stay with, let's see, should we revert to the regular order of business?

463
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,289
Is there a motion on the floor?

464
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:54,798
My intention was to take up both papers under suspension when I raised the motion.

465
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:55,919
Okay.

466
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:59,321
You want to take the second paper from the mayor?

467
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,303
Yes, but yeah, community preservation papers.

468
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:03,244
Okay, perfect.

469
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:14,091
20-319, the electronic delivery to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155 regarding the Community Preservation Committee.

470
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:25,580
Yeah, Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following on recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

471
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:42,692
Number one, requesting the appropriation of $250,000 from the CPA Community Housing Reserve to the Action for Boston Community Development, ABCD for the ABCD Rental Assistance for Medford Residents Program.

472
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:57,425
Number two, requesting the appropriation of $20,000 from the CPA Community Housing Reserve to Housing Families Incorporated to provide rental assistance as part of the Pro Bono Legal Services Program.

473
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:02,127
All projects will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category.

474
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,929
The category is Community Housing Reserve and General Reserve.

475
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,511
Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

476
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:10,832
Councilor Knight.

477
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:23,031
The first question that I'd have, Mr. President, is whether or not these appropriations and programs that we're funding would service 100% Medford residents.

478
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:33,335
Because community preservation funds are generated through an assessment on our property taxes, I think it's very important that we make sure that these funds stay within the confines of our community.

479
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:34,415
So I ask that question.

480
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:35,316
Okay.

481
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:39,397
Let's see.

482
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:41,558
Oh, Roberta.

483
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:43,929
Thank you.

484
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:45,930
Yeah, I can speak to that.

485
00:40:47,571 --> 00:41:01,778
We are required, but under fair housing federal fair housing law we cannot limit it strictly to only Medford residents however we can place a priority on Medford residents.

486
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:26,471
and given the amount of need that's anticipated and the fact that other communities who are working with ABCD are also putting funds on the table, it's highly unlikely that Medford's funds will be utilized supporting residents of other communities, that these funds are very highly likely to go entirely to Medford residents.

487
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,293
Mr. President,

488
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,815
From the presentation, Ms.

489
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:34,897
Cameron referred to limit it.

490
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:37,058
And when you say limit it, limit what?

491
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:42,622
Limit the expenditure of CPA funds or restrict the expenditure of CPA funds under this program?

492
00:41:49,896 --> 00:42:03,545
We cannot have housing pro publicly funded housing programs under federal fair housing law that are entirely restricted to residents of one community.

493
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:21,905
So the funds have to be applied in such a way that they allow for fair access to housing to people from, to all kinds of people who are protected classes.

494
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:31,452
Now, since Medford's population is already representative of protected classes under fair housing laws, Medford's,

495
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:45,882
The funds that Medford puts into programs like this, or any community preservation, or any publicly assisted housing, can very likely support Medford residents.

496
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,764
And in the past, I've provided a worksheet showing what the

497
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:59,612
who is supported by a local preference in housing programs.

498
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:04,597
So if we were to apply a local preference to Medford residents only, for example, the

499
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:17,331
That would exclude people who, say, have roots in Medford but have been displaced already and then don't have the opportunity to move back to Medford.

500
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:25,197
So that's an issue with requiring people to be Medford residents already before they can benefit from

501
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,191
from publicly funded housing programs.

502
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:54,144
In this instance, I believe that all of the units, that all of the residents who are going to be assisted are people who are already living in Medford because the type of assistance is emergency rental assistance for people who have come on hard economic times and are having difficulty being able to pay

503
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:55,846
their rent and mortgage.

504
00:43:55,946 --> 00:44:02,950
But I'd like to allow our applicants to speak to how the programs will work in their particular programs.

505
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:06,692
I certainly can appreciate that, Ms.

506
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:07,113
Cameron.

507
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:20,040
Like I said, my concern is that because these funds are generated from an assessment on property taxes from residents here in the community,

508
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,262
These funds really should stay within the confines of our community.

509
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:26,423
I don't see why we should be sending them out.

510
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:35,028
If we were going to be producing housing inside the community, and other people were going to be eligible to have access for it, that's one thing.

511
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:41,251
It's another thing if we're taking money and funding a program that's going to be servicing people that don't live here.

512
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,492
And I think that's what my concern is.

513
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:57,097
Well, we don't have the ability to help residents at all, Medford residents, without leaving the door cracked open.

514
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:12,446
And as I said, this program is by and large going to benefit Medford residents primarily, if not entirely, but we're required if we're going to help anyone at all to leave the door open.

515
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:20,393
So there's no guarantee that this money is going to service Medford residents?

516
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:24,574
There's a guarantee that if we don't spend it, we can't help Medford residents.

517
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:27,975
That's the only guarantee we have.

518
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:35,696
If we spend it, there's a guarantee that Medford residents could be left out, and they won't be able to have access to this, and it could go somewhere else outside.

519
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,817
I'd like to let our applicant speak, actually.

520
00:45:38,077 --> 00:45:38,397
Thank you.

521
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:44,499
There are a number of councilors that have questions first, so continue with the council.

522
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,360
Councilor Knight, are you all set?

523
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,122
Apparently, Ms.

524
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:52,725
Cameron is going to let other people answer the questions, so that's fine with me, absolutely.

525
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:57,189
Okay, we'll come back to the questions after, but Councilor Scott Pelley had a question.

526
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,218
George, you're muted.

527
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,578
I appreciate it.

528
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:13,499
Thanks, Council President.

529
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:22,605
I tend to understand with all the applicants that are here tonight that we'll be speaking on, and I can totally understand what's going on.

530
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:29,610
And I've been in, like most of the councils, I've been talking to Medford families that are in dire straits right now.

531
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:35,775
But I tend to agree with Councilor Knight that there's a possibility that Medford taxes

532
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:46,519
that make up our community preservation money that will be left out because we have to do this through the federal government.

533
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,059
I understand that.

534
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:51,200
But if I can't, I see that Dave's still here, Mr. Rodriguez.

535
00:46:53,621 --> 00:47:03,425
I could tell you, I think if we really try it as a community, there's got to be a way that we can fast track an application to a Medford

536
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:21,623
partnership with housing or method family network that you we can give I'm Guaranteeing we could find $250,000 to go to housing concerns of guaranteed method residents And has that been discussed at all?

537
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:22,904
Has that been an avenue?

538
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:26,967
Is this something that this is the the only way that it's it could be funneled through?

539
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:28,748
because I think

540
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:44,175
I think if there is another way, I think that we spend a little bit more time looking at different avenues that we know that 100% of the Medford tax payers' money that make up the preservation funding, that it goes directly to Medford residents.

541
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:49,217
So nothing against any of the applicants that are on tonight that don't live in Medford.

542
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:53,520
I completely, I understand how difficult it is.

543
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,262
And the people that are here, that offer Medford can apply in a different avenue.

544
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:04,927
and we can support them, what they need to survive this horrible time.

545
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:25,705
But I hate to see that there's going to be a Meffitt family looking out when the money might be going somewhere else, because we didn't do our due diligence to see if we had other avenues in filtering that and funneling that money toward the people of our community that need it 100% of the need.

546
00:48:25,845 --> 00:48:26,906
So thank you.

547
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,851
Yeah, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

548
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:36,353
Councilor Scarpelli, was that a question for the chief of staff or?

549
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:57,383
Yes, if we can't make it a motion, if we can, the chief of staff can, if he can answer it or if we can go back to his staff and find to see if there's, we've exhausted, because I know other communities have other partnerships in place to help the residents of their community

550
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,440
with rent and survival.

551
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,101
And they're not using the community preservation money.

552
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:12,946
So if I can hear that, that'll help me make my decision whether I want to vote for this or not this evening.

553
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:13,927
So thank you.

554
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:15,688
Thank you.

555
00:49:20,275 --> 00:49:21,035
Thank you for the question.

556
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:24,597
This is one thing that we're doing in terms of many.

557
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:26,579
So we are attacking this.

558
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:31,001
The CPC is taking one tactic in order to do this by funding these organizations.

559
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:39,527
We received close to a million dollars in additional CDBG funding that we're looking for the federal government to give us some guidance on how to program that money out.

560
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:47,789
and they've relieved the us of the obligation to the limit of the 15% cap of providing those services to public service organizations.

561
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,451
So this is one of many things that we're working on right now.

562
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:55,312
Alicia Hunt has been the running point on the CDBG process.

563
00:49:56,032 --> 00:49:59,233
If there are specific questions regarding how we're looking to program that money.

564
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:06,439
She would certainly be the best person to talk to her and her staff up at OCD who have been doing a lot of work to try to work on it.

565
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:09,221
I don't want to cut you off, Dave, Mr. President.

566
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:21,991
We looked at avenues within our community that have the ability to take that money and give it to the families of Medford that need it, that have been identified.

567
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:42,113
I'm talking about this $250,000 that's being asked to go to possibly, that I understand that many Method families will get it, but if there's one family from Method that doesn't get it, but someone in a neighboring community does get this money because it has to be dished out this way to the federal government, I think that's unfair.

568
00:50:42,274 --> 00:50:43,375
So the question is,

569
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:57,628
With this money, is there another way that we can make sure that the people that are in our meeting tonight that are from Medford that need this assistance, that we can guarantee that they're going to be one of the applicants that are going to be helped?

570
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:04,835
Because one of these people that are asking for assistance tonight, they might be one of the people that don't get it because it's gone somewhere else.

571
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,917
So I would hate to see that.

572
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,799
So that's what I'm asking.

573
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:25,633
My question is, did we do our homework to see if that $250,000 can go to another city partner to assure that 100% of that money that's raised by 100% taxpayer money goes to Method residents that are in need?

574
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:31,314
Because this is CPC, a CPC ask that just funneled through them.

575
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:40,757
The asking, although the communication does come from the mayor, is largely ministerial in that sense, is that we received the request from CPC and we forwarded right to the council, that's just a process issue.

576
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:52,900
In terms of the actual substantive questions about how these choices were made, those are choices that are best asked to Roberta and the rest of the CPC in terms of which applicants were, which applications were received,

577
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,842
and what due diligence was received in order to program this particular money.

578
00:51:57,302 --> 00:52:00,864
The administration does not have any oversight over CPC in that regard.

579
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:10,029
Just to follow that up, is there a venue, is there an avenue that the city administration can work with the CPC

580
00:52:11,025 --> 00:52:16,366
to take that money other than ABCD that we can then bring it directly to.

581
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:35,432
I know that Roberta's come to us in the past of an emergency application that's, so let's say fictitiously, Marie Cassidy from Method Family Networks comes in and asks for $250,000 from CPC that we can approve that so 100% of the money goes to Method residents.

582
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,432
Is that something that can be done?

583
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:39,996
The CBC, the CBC, CBC money is controlled by CPC.

584
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:43,137
So it's, it's, that's, that's, I think that's the answer to the question.

585
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:46,818
Um, and then Roberta and how that, that money's program is best asked her.

586
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:49,659
Thank you, Roberta.

587
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,240
Can Roberta answer that question, John?

588
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,341
So I'm going to call on a number of people.

589
00:52:53,361 --> 00:53:00,523
So we have Andre LaRue with us and we have, uh, Roberta Cameron and I, and we also have some, uh, Dana Stafford.

590
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,144
So I'm going to let them speak.

591
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:05,405
I think they'll be able to tell us more, give us more background.

592
00:53:06,108 --> 00:53:09,470
And then I think at that point, we'll have better questions to ask.

593
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:11,372
So if I'm going to allow them to speak right now.

594
00:53:11,392 --> 00:53:13,013
Point of information, Mr. President.

595
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:16,075
The question is pretty simple.

596
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:23,541
Someone could tell me that money can go to a Method entity through CPC to get up to 100% of Method residents.

597
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,642
Can someone just answer that yes or no?

598
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:26,943
If it's no, it's no.

599
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,504
And that's what I'm getting at.

600
00:53:28,524 --> 00:53:30,746
So that's why I'm going to let them speak now so they can answer your question.

601
00:53:31,106 --> 00:53:31,547
I'd love to.

602
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:31,807
Thanks.

603
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:32,928
Thank you.

604
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:35,363
Thank you.

605
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:46,801
First of all, a short answer to the question is that both federal and state housing law says that we cannot discriminate with public funds.

606
00:53:49,104 --> 00:54:06,189
we can prioritize, and the chances are that the funds will be utilized entirely, if not almost entirely, to serve Medford residents, and it will go to serve people who are living in Medford right now, given the nature of the types of programs that we're funding.

607
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,170
But I really think that we can't

608
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:28,716
continue to have the conversation without allowing the applicants to present what it is that they're going to be doing with the funds, because a lot of the questions that we're raising would be answered if we gave the applicants a couple of minutes to explain what their program is about, and they may be able to speak better to their programs than I've done so far.

609
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:30,797
Point of information, Mr. President.

610
00:54:31,337 --> 00:54:53,064
Roberta, all I'm asking is, I can appreciate what they're going to say, and I can appreciate, but what I'm saying is, before they even say anything, my answer could be answered if you could tell me that if the Medford Family Network or if another entity in Medford came to the CPC with an emergency application for $250,000 to help the families of Medford, could that be possible?

611
00:54:53,844 --> 00:54:55,065
It's nothing with an applicant's note.

612
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:56,365
If you could tell me that, it'd be great.

613
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:07,839
They could not provide a program that would match what these programs are doing, and they could not use public funds to discriminate.

614
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:21,690
Whether it's a Medford-based organization or an organization from outside of Medford who is helping Medford residents, if they are public funds, we cannot discriminate with public funds.

615
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:35,506
But I'd really like to hear from, if you may, Mr. President, if we could allow the applicants to explain how their program is going to work, because they may be able to answer the questions better than I have.

616
00:55:35,526 --> 00:55:40,069
Robert, everybody's going to get their turn.

617
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:45,054
The problem is everybody has questions all at once, okay?

618
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:52,359
So I want to try to get some of the housing, you know, people with housing backgrounds to kind of talk more about the issue.

619
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:57,603
Then councilors have questions and the recipients, everyone will get a chance.

620
00:55:57,623 --> 00:56:01,826
So if you just give me a couple of minutes, I'll now recognize Andre Larue.

621
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,069
Thank you, Mr. President.

622
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:10,232
And thank you to the city councilors for discussing this.

623
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:11,951
My name is Andre LaRue.

624
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:19,213
I'm the chair of the Medford Community Development Board, and I am that board's representative to the Community Preservation Committee.

625
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:32,437
And I worked on helping to put this proposal together so I can explain a little bit about where it came from and the research that we did and why we feel that this is a strong proposal and a way to spend this money.

626
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:39,159
So, Councillor Scarpelli, I think the simple question, the answer to your question is no.

627
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,039
We could not

628
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:49,201
We could not do anything more than what we're doing right now with any other organization, even if it was a local Medford organization.

629
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:59,908
So what we did is we looked at what other communities have rental stabilization programs and which organizations administer those programs.

630
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:09,235
We narrowed it down to a short list of organizations that have great experience in surrounding communities doing this work.

631
00:57:09,645 --> 00:57:29,979
And we figured that the best way of responding to this crisis around rent that people are going to be suffering from would be to ask an organization that has a staff capacity and existing program to just expand that program into Medford and to prioritize with this funding Medford residents.

632
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:37,264
So for example, ABCD has, although it's ABCD Boston is the official name,

633
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:51,601
They basically took over the organization TriCap that serves Medford, Everett, and Malden, and has its office in Malden a number of years ago, and their rental stable is

634
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:03,919
funded in large part by Malden CDBG funds, which means that Malden residents are prioritized.

635
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:15,542
So when we, so we could have a Medford resident right now apply to that program, but there's so many Malden residents who need that help that they will be on the priority list.

636
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:20,642
And the de facto effect is that no Medford residents can really access those funds.

637
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:23,223
So we would be doing the same thing with this funds,

638
00:58:23,823 --> 00:58:25,865
these funds but for Medford residents.

639
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:39,236
So the priority would be given to Medford residents and there would probably be so many Medford residents that would need this that no other residents from other communities would be unlikely, very unlikely to be able to tap into any of those those funds.

640
00:58:39,276 --> 00:58:46,521
And that's probably the best that we can do because as Roberta mentioned, federal law prohibits any further restriction than that.

641
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:46,982
So

642
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:50,053
That answers that question.

643
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:58,138
And we invited ABCD to come in for this funding in part because

644
00:58:58,725 --> 00:59:00,826
They're a large organization.

645
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:05,488
They have the staff capacity to ramp up a large program quickly.

646
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:16,672
And the other reasons that were very attractive to us is that they provide case management to families for six months after receiving any assistance.

647
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:21,474
So they will get documentation from the renter, from the landlord.

648
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:27,597
They will try to work out an arrangement with both of them together.

649
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:42,267
so that an adequate amount of money is given, so they can serve these resources, they steward these resources appropriately and conservatively, so that they can help as many families as possible.

650
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:55,333
They have a range of other services that they offer out of their Malden offices that people can access, so like food access, and they can make referrals for

651
00:59:56,845 --> 01:00:01,268
legal assistance and other kinds of assistance that they have.

652
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:12,294
So then they'll check on the families for, I think every month for six months down the road to make sure that those families then later don't fall out of housing stability.

653
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:17,737
So those were some of the things that I think we found as we were doing our research that was attractive to us.

654
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:26,282
And I'm sure that, you know, Jaina and Tabitha can answer further questions about how this works, but we were impressed with their

655
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,007
their experience.

656
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:29,408
Thank you.

657
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:31,508
Thank you very much.

658
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:33,849
Councilor Scott Pelli, is your question answered now?

659
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:34,629
I just want to make sure.

660
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:35,930
Thank you.

661
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,231
I appreciate the response.

662
01:00:38,431 --> 01:00:38,751
Thank you.

663
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:39,691
Thank you.

664
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,912
So we have a number of councilors up next.

665
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:44,393
Councilor Caviello, did you have your hand up before?

666
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:48,694
I did, Mr. President, but I'll wait to come back.

667
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:49,714
I want to hear what the other

668
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:54,393
people say before I ask my question.

669
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:56,533
So maybe my question may be answered before then.

670
01:00:56,873 --> 01:00:57,194
Okay.

671
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,974
Councilor Marks, you are up next.

672
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,636
Councilor Marks, are you with us?

673
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:09,977
He looks like he's frozen.

674
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:16,319
Very intense.

675
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:18,180
Councilor Morrell.

676
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,740
Thank you, Mr. President.

677
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:23,168
I just had a question regarding what priority means.

678
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:24,948
Is it time bound?

679
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:30,109
Is there a certain amount of time that Medford families can apply and then it would go down the list to other families?

680
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:33,929
I'm just curious for clarity on what priority signifies.

681
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:44,971
Yeah, I think Jaina really has to answer that question because I'm not as familiar with how they handle it internally.

682
01:01:46,532 --> 01:01:47,432
Jaina Stafford.

683
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:54,887
Let's see, oh, hi, Jaina.

684
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:56,569
Hi, hi, everyone.

685
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:59,031
Can you just give us your name and address for the record, please?

686
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:04,516
Yes, Jaina Stafford from Housing Families in Malden at 919 Eastern Ave.

687
01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:06,618
It's nice to see you all again.

688
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:13,364
And actually, I'm sorry, Jaina is from Housing Families, the ABCD folks, it's Alexia and Tabitha.

689
01:02:13,924 --> 01:02:14,745
Okay, thank you.

690
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,721
They may want to answer those questions first.

691
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:20,122
I would defer to Tabitha and Alexia.

692
01:02:20,843 --> 01:02:23,044
If they want to speak about their program, it's much larger.

693
01:02:23,064 --> 01:02:28,367
Alexia, would you like to speak first?

694
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:31,308
Or Tabitha?

695
01:02:31,328 --> 01:02:33,049
I can speak.

696
01:02:33,695 --> 01:02:36,197
Okay, Tabitha, why don't you talk about your program, please?

697
01:02:36,677 --> 01:02:41,260
Hi, Tabitha Gasson, Director of Housing for ABCD, 6 Pleasant Street, Malden, Mass.

698
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:53,547
So basically, to answer that direct question, I think priority, we will prioritize, we have, first of all, let me just say we do have funding from other cities and towns.

699
01:02:54,207 --> 01:03:01,212
And so the monies that we are servicing to help families in Medford would be for Medford families specifically.

700
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:09,786
When we take in the applications when we look through our different various funding sources We look for people who have an address that's in medford.

701
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:16,228
So we in in their properties in medford and so Um, that's how we will take on the priorities.

702
01:03:16,288 --> 01:03:27,652
We have money from cpc and and in malden We have money cdbg money in malden and other everett is reaching out to us with the same type of funding so I don't think that um

703
01:03:28,662 --> 01:03:32,445
using Medford money would be an issue during this time.

704
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,887
And so we will prioritize that.

705
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:40,031
And I think Andre did an excellent job speaking about the components of our program.

706
01:03:40,091 --> 01:03:52,280
I mean, the stabilization, you know, rental assistance in itself is a band-aid, but comprehensive case management, following up with the client, following up with the landlord.

707
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,744
We send out a landlord reference form every month just to see if the tenant's paying their rent.

708
01:03:57,144 --> 01:03:59,766
to see, you know, if there's any issues with the tenancy.

709
01:04:00,286 --> 01:04:07,311
We connect our tenants with, we connect the clients with fuel assistance resources, food pantry.

710
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:09,993
We do a comprehensive budget with that.

711
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:13,016
We'll help them with job search if they lost their job.

712
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:18,900
So there are a lot of components that we put into our package that makes that tenancy sustainable.

713
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,742
If we just threw money at it, it would just be a band-aid.

714
01:04:22,142 --> 01:04:25,565
But I'm quite sure that Medford families, if that's the concern,

715
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:51,533
The priority would be this money will first go to people who have an address in medford the only time that that would be a That would be something different is if we're not getting the numbers in medford and we're going to do a broad outreach to community partners in medford Because they know where the population is they know what the need is and that's going to be our number one priority to reach out to um community partners in medford

716
01:04:51,953 --> 01:04:57,839
So they can identify the families or the households that are in the greatest need so that we can service them.

717
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:01,903
Thank you very much.

718
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:04,165
And Jaina.

719
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:06,928
I'm happy to speak a little bit about our program too.

720
01:05:07,628 --> 01:05:12,773
So we see this as more of a compliment to the services that we're already offering.

721
01:05:13,274 --> 01:05:16,637
So we've been very fortunate to receive Medford CDBG funds.

722
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,236
for a number of years.

723
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:22,398
And that puts us in the community doing legal services.

724
01:05:22,939 --> 01:05:29,524
So we would accept of course, any referrals from ABCD for clients that need these legal services in the Medford community.

725
01:05:29,984 --> 01:05:34,448
And we would want to access these funds as a compliment to our legal services.

726
01:05:34,828 --> 01:05:46,437
So if we find ourselves negotiating in court or trying to work out a Medford case that's already progressed further than just the initial stages of having a smaller rearage

727
01:05:46,756 --> 01:05:51,380
then we would be able to access the money, particularly for these cases.

728
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:05,731
We saw it as kind of a streamlining where we wouldn't have to, we'd accept the referral from ABCD, we'd work on the case, and then we wouldn't have to send the families back to ABCD for rental assistance because we'd have a small amount of money that we could access directly.

729
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:05,871
Okay.

730
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:10,135
Thank you.

731
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,536
Did that answer your question?

732
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:14,158
Yes, that did.

733
01:06:14,198 --> 01:06:14,538
Thank you.

734
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:14,979
Okay.

735
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:15,259
Thank you.

736
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:16,730
Councilor Marks.

737
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:19,132
Thank you, Mr. President.

738
01:06:21,113 --> 01:06:22,694
I have a couple of questions.

739
01:06:23,715 --> 01:06:29,238
First of all, how did the CPC arrive at this dollar amount?

740
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,801
I can speak to that.

741
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:42,786
We have been putting, well, first of all, the community preservation funds can only be used for three,

742
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:52,679
kinds of projects, affordable housing, parks and playgrounds, and historic preservation.

743
01:06:53,139 --> 01:07:05,673
So we, since, for the last few years, while CPA has been in effect, we've gotten a lot of project applications for historic preservation projects and for parks projects.

744
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:13,996
But we have not gotten very many for affordable housing, even though we know that affordable housing is a huge need in the community.

745
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:23,179
So we've been setting aside funding every year to go into an affordable housing kind of account.

746
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:27,901
So that when we got some projects and applications, we'd have funding there to use it.

747
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:34,803
So we have about half a million dollars in an account right now for affordable housing.

748
01:07:35,163 --> 01:07:45,867
And given the scale of the crisis right now, we felt that we should make half of that funding available to try to help Medford families during this short term crisis.

749
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:55,590
But we didn't wanna spend down everything because we still wanted to have some funding available for actually an affordable housing project when it comes to us.

750
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:02,139
So if I could, so it doesn't sound like you had any game plan.

751
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:09,546
When I say you, I don't mean you in particular, but it doesn't sound like there was a game plan on why 250,000 was selected.

752
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:17,644
I realize you had a half a million, but why was 250,000 selected?

753
01:08:18,785 --> 01:08:28,312
Is it based on a number of families we believe that may be able to take advantage and that number would suit what we have the need for?

754
01:08:28,332 --> 01:08:36,818
And the reason why I bring this up is from what I'm hearing is there's a potential that if we do prioritize method residents,

755
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:43,824
And just say that we overestimated the amount of need that could be out there.

756
01:08:44,545 --> 01:08:51,731
And for instance, only $75,000 of Method residents came forward.

757
01:08:52,572 --> 01:09:00,379
The other amount, according to what was stated, would have to go to other people that may be outside this community.

758
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:08,282
we can't withdraw the money, right, once our priorities of method families are done, say, okay, now we want to opt out of the program.

759
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,803
So, I'm just wondering how we arrived at that 250.

760
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:23,667
Well, what I can say is that, I mean, it's not scientific for sure, I agree there, but it is, you know, if we assume that it's going to cost

761
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:29,297
you know, between one and $2,000 per family to serve.

762
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:34,982
And that's what we're hearing from organizations is generally what they need to help out a family.

763
01:09:35,062 --> 01:09:45,450
And given that this is a short-term crisis, we're hoping that most of the families that are being served by this just have, you know, are experiencing one or two difficult months.

764
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:51,215
And we just need to get them through this crisis so that hopefully they can go back to work on the other side of it.

765
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:54,447
and maybe a temporary unemployment situation.

766
01:09:54,507 --> 01:09:56,168
So that's what we anticipate.

767
01:09:56,468 --> 01:10:01,010
Now, we also anticipate that there's probably gonna be a lot of people that need this.

768
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:07,073
So if we estimate that 125 families will be helped with this $250,000, just $2,000 each, that's not a ton of families.

769
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:10,774
And we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to find 125 Medford families that need the help.

770
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:28,415
Um, you know, I think there's, we're more concerned that there could be, you know, thousands of families that need the help.

771
01:10:28,935 --> 01:10:35,621
And if that's the case, um, we may need to, uh, to dig deeper and use other funding sources.

772
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:41,065
Maybe some of the CDBG funding that could be coming from the federal government from the stimulus bill.

773
01:10:41,565 --> 01:10:44,708
The problem with that money is that it won't be available for,

774
01:10:45,321 --> 01:11:08,456
Probably, you know a couple of months anyways, because there's a lot more regulations around the federal money What we felt is that if we act quickly now, we could make this available This funding available for action for people who are suffering on may 1st when they can't pay their rent bills And so this is like the first money that we can get out the door and in fact, um, you know tomorrow there's

775
01:11:09,294 --> 01:11:18,998
The Mass Housing Partnership is hosting with CHAPA a webinar for communities around the state that are interested in doing the same thing using their community preservation funding.

776
01:11:19,518 --> 01:11:24,581
And there's 400 community, like, well, 400 people signed up for that webinar.

777
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:25,681
So the interest is huge.

778
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:29,703
We're actually, like, we'd be one of the first in the state to do this.

779
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,404
So I think we're where we need to be.

780
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:46,751
Mr. President, I also think it would be helpful maybe just to get an overview of eligibility requirements by the different programs.

781
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:49,571
And I think that would be very helpful.

782
01:11:50,092 --> 01:11:59,874
And my last point is, will the full amount be used towards rental assistance or is there an administrative cost associated with this?

783
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:14,981
Yeah, there is a small amount of the money that would be used for staffing and administration, but I believe that like $225,000 would be direct assistance to families.

784
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:17,943
So it's a fairly small amount for staffing.

785
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:32,334
And I don't know if Tabitha maybe could speak a little bit more towards how the income guidelines and how decisions get made on that side.

786
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,429
I think she's unmuted.

787
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,333
So that's a 10% administrative cost?

788
01:12:42,514 --> 01:12:42,734
Yeah.

789
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:44,175
Yeah.

790
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:50,480
So we do have a 10%, 9.7, I think, administrative costs.

791
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,601
And we're not using any for staffing.

792
01:12:53,022 --> 01:12:54,903
We're using a little more for outreach.

793
01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:59,586
So we're using existing staff to fund this.

794
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:04,350
So the majority of the money, the goal is that the majority of these funds go directly to the people who need it.

795
01:13:05,411 --> 01:13:10,074
So administrative costs and some money just to help with some outreach.

796
01:13:10,495 --> 01:13:18,160
So it's very little that we're using, you know, for anything other than direct assistance.

797
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:19,661
Okay.

798
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:22,443
And just what, what about basic eligibility?

799
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:31,798
So, I mean, eligibility, again, it's based on what the funding required, but I believe it was up to 200% of the poverty.

800
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:37,782
They have to be Medford residents or, you know, I mean, that's part of our requirement.

801
01:13:40,464 --> 01:13:42,625
But we just heard that's not a requirement.

802
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:49,210
Well, I apologize, Medford priority, but it's up to 200% FPL.

803
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:57,815
One of our goals is that they'll be able to sustain the tenancy after their rearage is paid.

804
01:13:58,555 --> 01:14:01,057
So their landlord has to be willing to participate.

805
01:14:01,197 --> 01:14:07,362
Hopefully after their rearage is paid, they have a job or something else that's going to sustain the tenancy.

806
01:14:08,463 --> 01:14:10,664
So that's the basic requirement.

807
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,851
You don't look at income, you don't look at anything.

808
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:21,256
Yeah, so they have to have the income that's going to make them able to sustain their tenancy.

809
01:14:21,596 --> 01:14:32,607
So after a rent is paid, they should be able to have the income or proof that they're going to have, if they're furloughed from a job, they'll have a job that will be able to continue to pay the rent after we pay their rearage.

810
01:14:33,495 --> 01:14:40,018
Um, so yeah, we do get we get we get proof of income We get you know, we get a copy of the lease proof of income.

811
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:44,100
We get proof of ownership from the landlord We get w-9s.

812
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:55,746
Uh, we do a budget with the families And we work on you know, the goal is that they'll be able to sustain the tenancy after we pay the arrearage we we do the budget because we also want the

813
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:01,786
the household, if they can't, to participate and pay back part of their, their rearage.

814
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:03,868
So it gives them some ownership towards this debt.

815
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:09,074
And, you know, and they have to be willing to participate in the stabilization program.

816
01:15:10,736 --> 01:15:14,220
So if they don't take part in stabilization, they can't take part of the program.

817
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:23,258
Nope, that, you know, they will agree up front, of course, and you know, I mean, that's 22 people agree up front to participate in stabilization.

818
01:15:23,278 --> 01:15:30,824
Um, you know, we pretty much know when we interview somebody, if they're, if they're going to be compliant, they'll sign off on it.

819
01:15:31,304 --> 01:15:38,870
It's different when we have a court order that says, okay, in order to get this money, you're going to participate, but we have to take people at face value.

820
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:41,052
You know, I mean, these are hard times.

821
01:15:41,812 --> 01:15:42,333
Um, you know,

822
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:49,414
chances are they're going to need the support, they're going to need fugal assistance, they're going to need future assistance from us in the past.

823
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:52,738
So we try to leverage other opportunities that we have.

824
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:59,747
So we give you this assistance, you know, you're going to be part of this whole, this network, and we're going to provide these supports to you.

825
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,148
You're going to have to continue to pay your rent.

826
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:08,872
They're going to have to sign an agreement with us that says, we're going to check in with your landlord, make sure you're able to pay your rent.

827
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:10,973
We're going to connect you with services.

828
01:16:11,453 --> 01:16:13,254
And so we'll check in with them every month.

829
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:14,394
We have them sign off.

830
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:20,978
Not much else we can do other than have them sign and agree that they will participate in six months of stabilization services.

831
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:27,732
We'll have a few that will fall through the cracks who will sign and not participate, but at least we put the good faith effort forth.

832
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,953
We do a complete service plan with them.

833
01:16:30,593 --> 01:16:44,858
And Councilor Marks, they do require documentation from the tenant about if there's a loss of income, for example, or what their current income is if they're already under the 200% of poverty line.

834
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:50,338
And then they also have to get documentation from the landlord.

835
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:54,781
So it's not just, you know, somebody coming in saying I need the money.

836
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:56,602
Point of information, Mr. President?

837
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:58,723
Point of information, Councilor Scarpallo.

838
01:16:59,063 --> 01:17:01,564
First of all, thank you, Andre, for clarifying that.

839
01:17:01,604 --> 01:17:06,507
But you said something that intrigued me, and I understood it.

840
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:07,928
But the point of information is,

841
01:17:09,576 --> 01:17:15,741
everybody's talking about sustainability, but when Council Marks asked, you know, how do we get to this point?

842
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:16,601
How do we choose this?

843
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:23,926
The response was there were families that need one to $2,000 just to get by this period.

844
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:28,530
So are we really, is that truly what we're looking for?

845
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:34,614
We're truly looking for the sustainability or is this just something that, like you said, just to get them through the next couple of months?

846
01:17:35,054 --> 01:17:37,956
Because if that's the case, do we truly need ABCD

847
01:17:38,938 --> 01:17:48,305
to divvy up this money or could we find, do a little bit more work to find another organization within our community that can use, apply for this money and then do that?

848
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:54,350
Well, from, I mean, our research, I would say that that would be very difficult to do.

849
01:17:54,650 --> 01:18:01,536
I think that, um, you know, we did, there are a short list of organizations that do this work.

850
01:18:01,956 --> 01:18:02,657
Um, but,

851
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:23,711
having the experience to be able to evaluate whether somebody can, um, you know, how much money to give somebody, whether, uh, it's going to be used well, um, avoid fraud, uh, all, you know, this organization has a lot of experience with that.

852
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:31,452
And so I, I would not want to just be trying to, you know, get it out the door without somebody who has that experience.

853
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:34,518
And Tabitha, did you want to say something else to that?

854
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:38,239
I mean, I think you hit on the point exactly.

855
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:40,980
I mean, we're a community action agency.

856
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,460
So our address is in Medford, I mean, in Malden.

857
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:49,701
Medford is part of our service area.

858
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:56,022
We could very well have an address or take a boat in a community center in Medford.

859
01:18:56,462 --> 01:18:58,523
It's just logistics at this point.

860
01:18:59,963 --> 01:19:03,227
The key is that these people that have the need is being served.

861
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:05,851
And yeah, we said 1000 to 2000.

862
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:10,396
It's not just to get them by but you know, to get them out of their rut.

863
01:19:10,897 --> 01:19:15,262
The sustainability pieces, you know, we don't know what COVID-19 is going to do.

864
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:17,085
We don't know how long this is going to be.

865
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:17,165
But

866
01:19:18,346 --> 01:19:28,236
Let's get you on your feet, let's get your rear-edge behind you, and let's look forward and work together on a plan on how you can sustain your tenancy going forward.

867
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:30,479
Are you going to get your job back?

868
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,461
Do you need to do an additional job search?

869
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:34,583
Do you have any difficulties with unemployment?

870
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:36,465
I mean, there's a lot of factors.

871
01:19:36,525 --> 01:19:38,447
I could take the whole meeting up talking about

872
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:48,754
the different components of doing this work, but it's not writing a check and forgetting we sent the money out or we put the money out the window.

873
01:19:49,234 --> 01:19:51,376
It's comprehensive and it's very strategic.

874
01:19:52,357 --> 01:19:58,141
Like I said, the question that was mentioned earlier was that we're just trying to get through the one

875
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,898
one month, two months here and there.

876
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:04,198
That's what I just want to know.

877
01:20:04,478 --> 01:20:05,359
Thank you, Andre.

878
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:16,603
And actually, the other thing, counselor, is that the state just approved and the governor signed a bill preventing evictions and foreclosures.

879
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:18,384
So that's frozen for right now.

880
01:20:18,484 --> 01:20:27,548
So nobody in Medford who's watching this should feel like they're being pressured to get out of their homes during this time of emergency.

881
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:34,815
The problem is that eviction and foreclosure freeze doesn't solve the problem.

882
01:20:35,815 --> 01:20:39,779
Tabitha was mentioning that the arrearage is still going to be there.

883
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:43,603
The rent is still going to accumulate during these months that they can't pay.

884
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:51,009
This program is an opportunity to put some money on the table where ABCD or Housing Families, Inc.

885
01:20:51,850 --> 01:21:05,476
could mediate a negotiation between the landlord and the tenant so that they can put some money on the table and say, hey, maybe this isn't all of it, but is this good enough to get through these months?

886
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:11,258
And then a couple of months down the road, hopefully they're employed again and off and running.

887
01:21:11,718 --> 01:21:14,941
Okay, so thank you, that's why, because what was said earlier, it was a little contradictory.

888
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:16,282
I just wanted to make sure that was the case.

889
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:17,484
So thank you so much.

890
01:21:18,044 --> 01:21:19,205
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

891
01:21:19,225 --> 01:21:22,708
Before Councilor Scott Pelli's point of information, Councilor Marks, you had the floor.

892
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:23,910
Were your questions answered?

893
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,912
They were, and I just had one follow up if I could.

894
01:21:26,932 --> 01:21:27,093
Sure.

895
01:21:28,594 --> 01:21:33,338
Because we're talking one to 2,000, and I realize every case is different.

896
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:37,780
I realize that, and I realize there's all different circumstances and so forth.

897
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,841
But we're almost close to two months into this.

898
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:44,702
And from what I'm hearing, this could last another month or two.

899
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:49,504
And so you're potentially talking three, four, five months.

900
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:54,185
And when I hear $1,000 or $2,000, believe me, every little bit helps.

901
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:58,989
But rents in Method are no longer $1,000, $1,200.

902
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:01,811
They're $2,000, $2,500, $3,000.

903
01:22:02,932 --> 01:22:20,808
And I'm just curious, if someone did lose their job or there's no income at all in the household, what is one or 2,000 going to do in a situation that you may need tens of thousands of dollars to keep someone going and functioning?

904
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:23,909
And, uh, are we underestimating this?

905
01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:37,158
I'd hate to see this go to, uh, you know, I liked the more the merrier in my, in my opinion, I'd like to help out a vast number of people with the two 50, rather than just maybe a handful, uh, with the money.

906
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:47,305
So I'm just wondering how, how do we work this, uh, to make sure that we spread it out and knowing that, um, we're spread thin already because.

907
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:52,247
you know, $250,000 is not a lot to help a city of this size.

908
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:54,548
So I was just wondering if I could throw that out there.

909
01:22:55,008 --> 01:22:55,188
Right.

910
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:56,809
Well, you're absolutely right, Councillor.

911
01:22:56,829 --> 01:23:02,091
I think the $1,000 to $2,000 number that I threw out there is an average.

912
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:07,293
So some people are actually going to maybe need a very small amount of money, maybe only $500.

913
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:08,693
Other people are going to need maybe $4,000.

914
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:09,273
And so I think there's

915
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:22,663
When you say, you know people who have like a twenty five hundred dollar rent, they lose their job And they don't have any prospects of getting it back.

916
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:36,848
I'm, not sure whether You know, they're going to be a really strong candidate for this for this program and i'm not sure how abcd uh, you know would handle that but I think that uh, You know, they need more help like this.

917
01:23:36,908 --> 01:23:43,451
This program is not going to be like paying their rent forever right for anybody um, but but you know if they could

918
01:23:44,156 --> 01:23:51,441
they might be able to say their rent is $2,000, and maybe they can only come up with $1,200 this month.

919
01:23:52,122 --> 01:23:59,767
Maybe they can put some of their stimulus check or some of their unemployment into it, but they need $800 to make the rest of it.

920
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:04,951
Then I think that's what we're hoping will kind of get them, keep them going.

921
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:06,972
Thank you.

922
01:24:08,093 --> 01:24:10,254
And yeah, Tabitha, you probably wanted to step in.

923
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:15,511
Yeah, and so Andre is exactly right.

924
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:17,752
And what we do is we pool resources.

925
01:24:17,872 --> 01:24:22,413
I mean, we sit down with them, we identify what their resources are, what they can contribute.

926
01:24:23,253 --> 01:24:29,155
And again, sometimes, you know, we look at other resources like RAP and CDBG, other funding sources.

927
01:24:30,235 --> 01:24:34,799
that we may have access to in order to help this family to sustain.

928
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:42,705
And again, there may be those families that won't get a job back, and it's unrealistic to think that they're going to pay $2,300 a month.

929
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:47,188
And then we have a different conversation with them.

930
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,190
It's a harder conversation.

931
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,971
But again, we work together.

932
01:24:51,031 --> 01:24:52,993
Our goal is not to leave anyone high and dry.

933
01:24:53,604 --> 01:24:57,408
we work with them on finding out what other options are available to them.

934
01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:01,633
You know, the hardest thing is to ever counsel somebody to go into a family shelter.

935
01:25:01,954 --> 01:25:08,181
The hardest thing is to say, maybe you could consider living with family and friends, you know, but our goal is not to do that.

936
01:25:08,301 --> 01:25:13,607
So we pool as much resources as we can together to help that household sustain where they are.

937
01:25:15,362 --> 01:25:25,185
And if we get these families through, you know, a month or two with this program, then there may be more funding to tap into through the CDBG funds coming down in a couple of months.

938
01:25:28,066 --> 01:25:28,826
Thank you.

939
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:29,306
Thank you.

940
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:29,826
Thank you.

941
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:30,407
Thank you.

942
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:31,507
Councilor Marks.

943
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:37,409
Councilor Knight.

944
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:38,749
Mr. President, thank you very much.

945
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:40,570
I have two questions.

946
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:44,531
The first one is, I'm not sure who said it in their presentation,

947
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:49,543
but I believe the term was we invited them to apply.

948
01:25:50,683 --> 01:26:00,867
And I'm wondering if that is, you know, there's an open enrollment period or an emergency enrollment period and they're saying, look, if these resources are available, please apply.

949
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:08,442
or if this is a, hey, we know a great organization, let's call them and tell them to apply for this money, because this is a program we need, I guess.

950
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:16,670
Is the community and the community-based organizations driving the request for the program, or is the CPC driving the request for applicants?

951
01:26:17,993 --> 01:26:19,254
Yeah, I can answer that, counselor.

952
01:26:20,114 --> 01:26:23,857
It's the CPC extended an invitation to these organizations.

953
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:33,442
So we put together and really Roberta took the initial lead on the research, put together a list of organizations that does this kind of work in the area.

954
01:26:33,923 --> 01:26:40,827
And then I conducted interviews of all of the organizations and really probed what their

955
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:47,875
staff capacity was and their perspective on managing these programs and how they would use the money and get them out the door.

956
01:26:48,235 --> 01:26:53,399
And then we extended an invitation to a couple of them to come in for funding.

957
01:26:53,759 --> 01:27:04,006
And the way that this works is we see this as really complimentary, you know, ABCD has the staff capacity, they're a large organization, they can ramp up and serve a lot of families in a short period of time.

958
01:27:05,206 --> 01:27:09,008
but they don't necessarily have the attorneys in-house.

959
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:16,791
Some of the families that need help may a few months down the road be dealing with kind of legal issues with their landlord.

960
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:19,012
And so Housing Families, Inc.

961
01:27:19,432 --> 01:27:23,194
really has a very strong legal services program.

962
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:30,317
They already have an ongoing contract for like $12,000 of CDBG funds from the city of Medford.

963
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,291
So they have experience here.

964
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:42,298
They do monthly, um, like kind of, uh, office hours at the senior center and, but $12,000 is not going to go very far at all in this crisis.

965
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:47,902
So we invited them to come in and, uh, and kind of supplement that funding as well.

966
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,383
So that's why you have the two.

967
01:27:49,483 --> 01:27:58,469
So the folks at ABCD encounter, they're going to do like the primary case management and, uh, when people coming in the door, but if they need,

968
01:27:59,312 --> 01:28:02,533
specific legal help, they will refer them to Housing Families, Inc.

969
01:28:03,013 --> 01:28:06,934
for that side of the program.

970
01:28:07,314 --> 01:28:09,535
I don't want to be misunderstood, Mr. President.

971
01:28:09,615 --> 01:28:13,736
I certainly understand the work that these organizations do and I appreciate the work that they do.

972
01:28:14,216 --> 01:28:18,377
My biggest concern is taking property tax dollars and these monies that are

973
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:25,583
generated through an assessment on a property tax here for a homeowner and them having the opportunity to be used outside of the community.

974
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:27,624
That's my biggest concern.

975
01:28:27,644 --> 01:28:28,564
That's my biggest issue.

976
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:36,126
But it seems like a lot of those concerns have been addressed with the presentation.

977
01:28:37,107 --> 01:28:48,590
One question I would have for our CPC administrator or CPC staff is, does the council have the right to reduce the appropriation and allow this applicant to come back at a later date for further funding?

978
01:28:49,384 --> 01:28:50,705
Councilmarks made a great point.

979
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:54,328
If the need's not there, then these funds could go somewhere else.

980
01:28:54,348 --> 01:28:57,690
Why release $250,000 when we could release $75,000 now, $75,000 later, and then $100,000 at the end if that need needs to be met?

981
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,791
Is it in our best interest to

982
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:21,955
appropriate 50% of our CPC funds that are in the affordable housing bucket at this time, or should we give less money and allow them the opportunity to come back and ask for more if the need is there?

983
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:29,558
Roberta, Danielle, would either one of you like to take that one?

984
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:33,359
Oh, Danielle.

985
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:40,208
Hi, good evening.

986
01:29:40,228 --> 01:29:40,768
Hi.

987
01:29:42,429 --> 01:29:44,369
I guess there's a variety of ways you could do it.

988
01:29:44,389 --> 01:29:52,791
I guess what we're trying to figure out is what kind of list of potential applicants we have.

989
01:29:52,811 --> 01:30:04,573
You do have the power to reduce the award at this time if you wanted to.

990
01:30:05,592 --> 01:30:15,659
even though the CPC is recommending 250,000, but you have the power to say, no, we're not going to do that, we'll reduce it down.

991
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:31,429
Or we could potentially table it and see if we get, see who applies for it and then decide on the award size.

992
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:37,876
I mean, we're trying to kind of like figure this program out as we go along.

993
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:45,203
But I understand the concern, it's valid to try to make sure that these go to Medford residents.

994
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:50,688
I don't know, Roberta, do you have any ideas of

995
01:30:51,850 --> 01:31:07,773
It seems to me that since the committee has already recommended $250,000, that if the council wanted to approve a portion of that now and a portion later, that would make sense.

996
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:15,554
One of our concerns was that a certain economy of scale is helpful in being able to use these funds efficiently.

997
01:31:15,574 --> 01:31:15,654
So a,

998
01:31:20,878 --> 01:31:33,705
starting with an amount that's too small to make a difference might make it more challenging for them to be able to ramp up the program and to be able to provide the outreach that will be effective in helping Medford families.

999
01:31:34,385 --> 01:31:49,893
So maybe it could make sense, for example, to disperse the funds, to approve the funds in two halves, giving us a chance to come back and report to the council after say a month of

1000
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:59,792
how the funds are being utilized and what the volume of demand is, applications is for utilizing the funds.

1001
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:19,548
Yeah, and if I may, one thing that hasn't been mentioned, but the CPC did put a requirement on this funding request that they would have to give us monthly reports on who they were serving and where, you know,

1002
01:32:21,158 --> 01:32:26,822
how much money was each award, and things like that.

1003
01:32:30,165 --> 01:32:30,886
Councilor Knight.

1004
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:36,450
The last question I have, I think the chief of staff is on the call, if I'm not mistaken.

1005
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,711
What's the mayor's position on this?

1006
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:43,356
Is the mayor supportive of this appropriation, or is this something that the mayor doesn't see as appropriate?

1007
01:32:43,396 --> 01:32:47,099
Does this fall within our housing needs and use plan that we have in place?

1008
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:49,701
Those are the questions I'd have for the administration if they can answer that.

1009
01:32:50,803 --> 01:32:53,345
I think Dave was on the call.

1010
01:32:53,405 --> 01:32:56,807
I don't think he's on the call any longer, but Adam, would you know for sure?

1011
01:32:57,267 --> 01:32:58,508
That is correct, he's off the call.

1012
01:32:59,089 --> 01:32:59,769
Okay, thank you.

1013
01:33:02,191 --> 01:33:06,434
Okay, so we have a number of, so up next is Councilor Beers.

1014
01:33:08,055 --> 01:33:15,179
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Roberta, Andre, Danielle, Tabitha, Jayna, everyone who's been working on this.

1015
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:20,503
I think this meets the early scope

1016
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:21,591
Of this crisis.

1017
01:33:21,631 --> 01:33:27,314
I think the point of getting money out the door, um to try to help people who are in need right now is really well taken.

1018
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:47,688
Um I would be fine with if we wanted to do a half and half but um disbursement, but i'd really want to Make sure that if the need is greater than you know if we're running out in in a week or two weeks and not in a month that we can come back and discuss it sooner because just from the discussions that i've had and the calls that i've been getting, you know, i've talked to

1019
01:33:48,487 --> 01:33:50,169
30, 40 people who are having trouble.

1020
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,392
And if we're talking $1,000 to $2,000, that's 125 to 250 people.

1021
01:33:52,452 --> 01:33:57,458
And I'm sure that I'm not speaking to nearly even a small chunk of the folks who are in need right now in our city.

1022
01:34:05,949 --> 01:34:08,410
I really think this is a great effort.

1023
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:14,852
I'm really glad that you've all been working on this, and I really hope we can move it forward as quickly as possible because the need is there.

1024
01:34:14,872 --> 01:34:27,176
And as a lot of the conversations around housing have been happening, you know, people were feeling okay for March and maybe okay for April, and now it's really, you know, we're getting into week six, week seven, week eight.

1025
01:34:28,856 --> 01:34:33,658
The other side of it, too, is that the unemployment benefit systems have not been working quickly.

1026
01:34:33,818 --> 01:34:45,504
And if you combine the calls that I'm getting and the work that I'm trying to do on that side with the people who are concerned about housing, it makes me to think that we're going to need to go beyond this, hopefully.

1027
01:34:46,204 --> 01:34:46,984
And hopefully we can.

1028
01:34:47,204 --> 01:34:49,706
And hopefully the federal and state government are there to help us with that.

1029
01:34:50,206 --> 01:34:54,008
Because I don't think, even in Medford, we're going to have the resources to meet the need.

1030
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,969
So I just want to say thank you, and I strongly support this.

1031
01:34:58,711 --> 01:34:59,832
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

1032
01:34:59,872 --> 01:35:05,055
We have Vice President Caviello, Councilor Morrell, and Councilor Scapelli.

1033
01:35:05,735 --> 01:35:06,476
Thank you, Mr. President.

1034
01:35:06,596 --> 01:35:10,178
A lot of good information going around here.

1035
01:35:10,918 --> 01:35:15,221
One of my questions is, who is going to be the watchdog for the city of Medford on this?

1036
01:35:17,682 --> 01:35:18,743
Anybody have a question?

1037
01:35:18,803 --> 01:35:19,743
Anybody have an answer to that?

1038
01:35:21,665 --> 01:35:22,065
Danielle.

1039
01:35:22,985 --> 01:35:24,846
I would be monitoring the program.

1040
01:35:27,606 --> 01:35:29,908
Um, CPA projects, I'm sorry.

1041
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:37,755
As I do all of the CPA projects I monitor them all to make sure that they're spent in accordance with the with the awards and the grant agreements.

1042
01:35:38,536 --> 01:35:39,036
Thank you.

1043
01:35:39,177 --> 01:35:39,597
Thank you.

1044
01:35:39,977 --> 01:35:47,104
And my another question is, my other question is,

1045
01:35:49,121 --> 01:36:01,425
I would support, I can probably support half of this going on right now, because I would think within the first week or two weeks, you're gonna know what the demand is almost immediately.

1046
01:36:03,126 --> 01:36:09,768
So I think if the demand is there right away, you come back right away and you get support.

1047
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:17,811
But the biggest question I get is outside agencies telling the city of Medford how to spend taxpayer dollars.

1048
01:36:18,753 --> 01:36:43,788
uh, and that's where I get the concern on that because again, um, Especially if it's not going to city of method residence, uh, that that's where the bad rub comes in, uh with a lot of with a lot of people so that's really what my biggest concern and so if if you start out with half and the demand is there fine, uh, then we then you then we support the rest of the of the of the money, but uh, let's see what the demand is before

1049
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:46,643
We go out and put all the money out there.

1050
01:36:46,683 --> 01:36:50,407
And then like Councilor Mark says, what if there's not the demand that we think is there?

1051
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:54,571
I mean, hopefully this situation doesn't go on forever.

1052
01:36:57,013 --> 01:37:00,256
And let's just play it by ear.

1053
01:37:00,276 --> 01:37:06,763
But I say, I would support half the money being appropriated this evening with some kind of,

1054
01:37:09,068 --> 01:37:16,712
with some kind of documentation coming back within a week or two weeks saying that there is more need, and could we have the other half of the money?

1055
01:37:18,953 --> 01:37:20,354
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1056
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:26,217
Councilor Morrell is up next, then Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Pierce, and Councilor Marks.

1057
01:37:27,218 --> 01:37:28,198
Thank you, Mr. President.

1058
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,820
Yeah, I want to thank everyone who brought this forward.

1059
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:36,143
I know this was put together with some amount of speed because this is what's necessary at these times.

1060
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:44,566
This crisis is happening in real time and people's needs are happening in real time and different levels of government can act at different levels of speed.

1061
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:47,227
And I think we need to respond to this as much as we can.

1062
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:49,949
This crisis impacts people differently.

1063
01:37:49,969 --> 01:37:52,570
A lot of us are fortunate enough to be able to work from home.

1064
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:54,391
We continue our work and we don't notice it.

1065
01:37:54,752 --> 01:37:57,153
There are people that this is making a huge impact on.

1066
01:37:58,017 --> 01:38:00,719
22 million people applying for unemployment throughout the country.

1067
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:02,800
These are incredible numbers.

1068
01:38:03,581 --> 01:38:05,101
And I think we're going to see the demand.

1069
01:38:05,242 --> 01:38:09,784
And I think there's been a lot of questions about an agency like ABCD facilitating this.

1070
01:38:09,824 --> 01:38:22,572
And I think those questions have been answered and addressed in the sheer scope of the challenge and the fact that ABCD goes farther to follow people and help them really in the ways they need to be helped when they do qualify for these programs.

1071
01:38:23,392 --> 01:38:27,613
My father led one of the sister organizations to ABCD for the entirety of his career.

1072
01:38:27,993 --> 01:38:32,375
And I've seen how this impacts communities, how it impacts people who need these programs.

1073
01:38:33,015 --> 01:38:42,037
And I have all the faith in programs like ABCD to facilitate these things and to help people and to do the vetting and to make sure that Medford is put first.

1074
01:38:42,517 --> 01:38:46,098
And to the point that has been made before, if we don't do this, nothing's happening.

1075
01:38:47,139 --> 01:38:52,500
Of course, there is a small amount of risk as we kind of build the plane as we're flying it, but we're in unprecedented times.

1076
01:38:52,950 --> 01:39:00,917
And I think this is something that we do need to move forward with to help Medford families and to offer something for people who are really struggling right now.

1077
01:39:01,097 --> 01:39:02,919
So I look forward to supporting this.

1078
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:04,981
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1079
01:39:06,382 --> 01:39:07,423
Councilor Scarpelli.

1080
01:39:08,339 --> 01:39:09,341
Thank you, Mr. President.

1081
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:17,310
Again, everybody involved, Roberta, Tabitha, Andre, Danielle, I thank you all.

1082
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:20,133
I think that we need to do something.

1083
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:23,236
I agree that something has to be moved forward, but I think that

1084
01:39:24,277 --> 01:39:28,461
the questions that are asked aren't in a negative fashion, in the sense that we don't want to help people.

1085
01:39:28,481 --> 01:39:29,342
I hope you understand that.

1086
01:39:29,362 --> 01:39:35,327
I think that it's making sure that we cross our T's and dot our I's.

1087
01:39:35,707 --> 01:39:36,948
And I think you've done a great job.

1088
01:39:37,008 --> 01:39:40,331
And I think that, you know, Andre, thank you for answering those questions.

1089
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:42,033
For me, it made me understand.

1090
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:50,760
I also agree with my fellow council, Councilor Marks, when he looks at the distribution.

1091
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,421
And I think that

1092
01:39:51,841 --> 01:40:17,376
doing it in in to and doing it enough like Roberta said that it reaches enough people but then shows us Again, and I and our constituents that listen there are people here and we all know they're gonna need I know that council bear said earlier I've been filled in phone calls in a daily basis myself and you know, so I know Tabitha I could tell you right now the method family network Mike Durham who's our veterans affairs director our immigration

1093
01:40:18,597 --> 01:40:22,220
you know, uh, uh, offices and reaching out to those families.

1094
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,542
We all know we're going to hit, hit that number easily.

1095
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:27,884
That's not going to be, that's not going to be the concern.

1096
01:40:27,904 --> 01:40:31,447
I think that right now is making sure that those questions were answered.

1097
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:36,711
And I, I appreciate all your hard work to this because I think Nicole, uh, Councilor Morrell is right.

1098
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:38,992
If we're not doing something, we're not doing anything.

1099
01:40:39,072 --> 01:40:42,615
So, um, uh, this was thorough in the, the answers, but.

1100
01:40:42,955 --> 01:40:44,196
I also agree with Council Mox.

1101
01:40:44,236 --> 01:40:49,080
I think that showing us the process, I think will be very helpful.

1102
01:40:49,161 --> 01:40:49,721
So thank you.

1103
01:40:50,842 --> 01:40:51,943
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

1104
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:52,684
Councilor Pierce?

1105
01:40:54,105 --> 01:41:10,199
Yeah, and I think just along the same lines, hopefully, you know, it's trial by fire and it's not the circumstances you ever want to be doing this, but building that relationship with you now, you know, if we had had this relationship before, some of these, we'd have more understanding, we'd have some answers to the questions.

1106
01:41:11,001 --> 01:41:14,644
I think it speaks to the need, we needed this before, we definitely need it now.

1107
01:41:14,844 --> 01:41:18,887
And building those relationships and connections will help us all going forward.

1108
01:41:18,927 --> 01:41:25,691
And again, I do hope it's not, as long as many of us think it is right now, but we gotta prepare for that.

1109
01:41:27,072 --> 01:41:29,554
Thank you, Councilor Beers, Councilor Marks.

1110
01:41:31,696 --> 01:41:33,757
Yeah, Councilor Marks.

1111
01:41:36,919 --> 01:41:37,520
Sorry about that.

1112
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:40,395
This question is for Tabitha.

1113
01:41:41,336 --> 01:41:51,467
Tabitha, currently right now over the last six, seven weeks, I'm sure ABCD has fielded phone calls regarding Method residents that have concerns.

1114
01:41:51,547 --> 01:41:52,588
Is that not correct?

1115
01:42:00,546 --> 01:42:02,810
To be there, if you could start again, I'd share that with you.

1116
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:03,811
Okay, thank you.

1117
01:42:04,152 --> 01:42:10,663
Yeah, we have, I mean, we've received calls, we have received calls from different residents for a variety of things.

1118
01:42:10,823 --> 01:42:13,788
Food has been one of the major things.

1119
01:42:14,292 --> 01:42:20,916
I mean, I don't think they know right now that we have the resources for financial assistance.

1120
01:42:21,516 --> 01:42:24,738
But once they know that, the calls will come in directly for that.

1121
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,121
Fuel assistance, food, help with taxes, there's various calls.

1122
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:39,946
We've received, when I talked with the community network partners, we received about 70 calls from the Medford area with varying needs.

1123
01:42:41,567 --> 01:42:43,608
What about regarding housing assistance?

1124
01:42:44,728 --> 01:42:46,949
We haven't not for rental assistance.

1125
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:51,730
We haven't received any specific calls when we got in rental assistance yet.

1126
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:52,990
And why is that?

1127
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,210
I think they don't know that's what we do.

1128
01:42:55,891 --> 01:43:00,192
And so we have a housing department in Medford.

1129
01:43:00,732 --> 01:43:02,772
It's been really uncharted territory.

1130
01:43:03,212 --> 01:43:05,213
I said that during my interview.

1131
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:16,300
But I think once they know that we are up into speed and we're doing housing and have rental assistance in Medford, I don't think that's going to be an issue.

1132
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:27,989
We did get, and let me take that before we even apply for this, we did get a few calls regarding homeless families because of our mobile homeless outreach program, but nothing specifically for rental assistance.

1133
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:29,370
Right.

1134
01:43:29,971 --> 01:43:35,675
And I'm just curious, what percent of ABCD's budget is state funded?

1135
01:43:37,437 --> 01:43:38,679
Alexi, are you still on?

1136
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:39,520
Can you answer that?

1137
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:49,673
I think we lost her.

1138
01:43:49,993 --> 01:43:51,455
No, I'm here.

1139
01:43:51,535 --> 01:43:52,616
Oh, there she is.

1140
01:43:52,796 --> 01:43:53,557
Alexi is here.

1141
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:59,054
Um, so let's see, can we just have your name and address for the record for the clerk, please?

1142
01:43:59,314 --> 01:43:59,474
Yes.

1143
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:02,016
Alexi Lane Lowman, one 58 Brown Ave.

1144
01:44:02,356 --> 01:44:03,677
Um, Roslindale, Massachusetts.

1145
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:04,358
Thank you.

1146
01:44:04,958 --> 01:44:12,083
Um, so the question was how much is state funded particularly correct of your program?

1147
01:44:12,103 --> 01:44:15,685
How much is state funded of housing or of the agency as a whole?

1148
01:44:17,046 --> 01:44:17,606
Either one.

1149
01:44:17,867 --> 01:44:22,810
I'd like to know how much of your housing program is state funded, um, of the housing program.

1150
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:27,561
I'm one of our contracts just ended.

1151
01:44:27,601 --> 01:44:29,802
So I'm trying to do math quickly in the moment.

1152
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:32,904
Um, just a ballpark, just a ball.

1153
01:44:32,924 --> 01:44:37,066
What percent of housing is funded through the state?

1154
01:44:37,547 --> 01:44:41,269
I would say about half, but it's, it's, I'm sorry to say it this way.

1155
01:44:41,309 --> 01:44:52,435
It's kind of complicated math because, um, the majority of housing funds come through the department of, um, housing and community development, but they originate as federal funds.

1156
01:44:55,387 --> 01:45:02,452
Our program is CSBG funded, which comes through DHCD, which is basically...

1157
01:45:03,927 --> 01:45:04,627
federal funds.

1158
01:45:04,867 --> 01:45:05,047
Right.

1159
01:45:05,087 --> 01:45:08,068
It originates as federal funding, but it flows through the state.

1160
01:45:08,668 --> 01:45:21,890
Um, so if you're asking particularly like similar funding as the CPC funding, um, we've just started, um, two new contracts with the city of Malden that are for this same type of programming.

1161
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:24,451
Um, we are seeking this contract right now.

1162
01:45:24,471 --> 01:45:29,011
Um, yeah, my, my, my, my question is, cause it reaped my tweak.

1163
01:45:30,252 --> 01:45:32,532
My curiosity is that, um,

1164
01:45:33,042 --> 01:45:41,664
It was just mentioned that Method residents really don't know that maybe rental assistance money may be available to ABCD.

1165
01:45:43,008 --> 01:45:48,352
And I know for years, your organization has received either federal or state money.

1166
01:45:49,533 --> 01:46:04,125
And I'm wondering why that outreach hasn't been done over the years, so that Method residents would know, hey, if I have a concern, let me pick up the phone and call an agency that's right next door in the city of Malden, and I may be able to get some assistance.

1167
01:46:05,386 --> 01:46:07,587
So that is my curiosity a little bit.

1168
01:46:08,888 --> 01:46:14,276
why it seems to be new to the city of Meffitt where there's been federal and state money for many years.

1169
01:46:15,152 --> 01:46:20,056
So that, I think that maybe it's a matter of nuance in the conversation.

1170
01:46:20,116 --> 01:46:24,800
So we're particularly and specifically talking about rental assistance funds.

1171
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:43,795
Since we took over for TRICAP, we've been serving Medford residents and providing the same housing counseling package of programming that Tabitha described earlier that involves budgeting, stabilization, case management, access to other services, and really maximizing the benefits that are available to somebody.

1172
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:53,506
particularly rental assistance is one of the least funded categories of benefit that folks are really in need of.

1173
01:46:53,646 --> 01:47:02,857
And so when we're talking about calls for specifically rental assistance, folks who are in need know often

1174
01:47:03,818 --> 01:47:10,764
Go to ABCD for this service go to housing families for that service.

1175
01:47:11,484 --> 01:47:17,249
And when there aren't rental funds available, period because it's not within the system.

1176
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:21,092
Folks know that they're not available.

1177
01:47:21,152 --> 01:47:42,893
So if this were to be granted very quickly The word would spread that there are rental assistance funds available I know that with our work in Boston that most of the calls that we get have a need for rental assistance rather whether it's large or small and

1178
01:47:43,033 --> 01:47:54,201
And so it is a little chicken or the egg, unfortunately, in the conversation right now, but it's not that ABCD and our services are not known to Medford residents.

1179
01:47:54,581 --> 01:47:59,205
It's that this particular aspect is not known because it hasn't existed before.

1180
01:48:00,506 --> 01:48:11,714
Okay, so the COVID-19 RAF money that was just made available, do we have any Medford residents taking advantage of that?

1181
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:14,878
Did you say the RAF money?

1182
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:15,919
Yes.

1183
01:48:16,059 --> 01:48:16,279
Yes.

1184
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:29,984
We don't administer RAF, Metro Housing does, but if someone was to come to us with an enrerage or we would refer them to RAF for RAF services, but we don't administer RAF.

1185
01:48:30,044 --> 01:48:33,025
We refer to, we send referrals into a RAF.

1186
01:48:33,245 --> 01:48:35,486
So have you sent method referrals into RAF?

1187
01:48:36,566 --> 01:48:37,867
We have not to date.

1188
01:48:40,068 --> 01:48:40,828
And why is that?

1189
01:48:42,203 --> 01:48:50,272
It could be that another community partner, as Alexia said, it could be, you know, ABCD is known for specific services.

1190
01:48:51,023 --> 01:48:56,026
A RAF referral could be put in through any community-based organization.

1191
01:48:56,546 --> 01:49:04,370
So they may be seeing another organization, they could see a social worker at a clinic, and they could put through a RAF application.

1192
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:10,233
You know, since we've been in the Tri-Area, I would have to say we do see Methodist residents.

1193
01:49:10,413 --> 01:49:16,636
Mostly we get calls regarding homeless people who have been noticed in the area because of our mobile homeless outreach.

1194
01:49:17,296 --> 01:49:27,359
But most Methodist families or households come to us through one of our other services, Head Start, through our fuel assistance program.

1195
01:49:28,177 --> 01:49:30,238
through one of those services.

1196
01:49:30,318 --> 01:49:36,319
And so housing may be addressed in that area, and they may be working with other entities.

1197
01:49:36,739 --> 01:49:43,821
What existed before in Medford related to housing before we came in the Tri-Area, but there's a lot of components.

1198
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:50,663
We've been a little slow up getting into Medford and really developing a stronghold.

1199
01:49:50,703 --> 01:49:55,985
I mean, tomorrow, if we could, we could put an umbrella up in Medford, but it has not been.

1200
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:01,792
housing rental assistance that they've been seeking.

1201
01:50:01,832 --> 01:50:03,473
They've been seeking other services.

1202
01:50:04,033 --> 01:50:12,638
And where we do a one-door, one-stop shopping, if they go to fuel assistance and they have a need for housing, it could be addressed that way.

1203
01:50:12,658 --> 01:50:17,100
If they go to our neighborhood service center, it could be addressed to a case manager there.

1204
01:50:17,938 --> 01:50:31,967
If it's something that's really complicated, like they need access to shelter, or they need something that one of our other arms cannot deal with, then they will refer them to us for more comprehensive services.

1205
01:50:32,027 --> 01:50:35,990
So any one of our doors is like a general practitioner.

1206
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:44,215
And if they have a heart condition, or if they have a housing condition that can't be fixed by a general practitioner, they'll refer them to our housing department for a specialty.

1207
01:50:44,787 --> 01:50:53,009
So, yeah, we do have some work to get in there and say, hey, we got rental assistance money here, and we are more than fuel assistance.

1208
01:50:53,029 --> 01:50:55,870
We're more than our food pantries.

1209
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,410
We're more than our Head Start.

1210
01:50:58,431 --> 01:51:04,712
And since we've been in a tri-area, Method's been slow in coming on board, but it's coming.

1211
01:51:04,812 --> 01:51:05,312
It's there.

1212
01:51:06,253 --> 01:51:07,913
And our reputation

1213
01:51:09,883 --> 01:51:10,644
precedes us.

1214
01:51:10,684 --> 01:51:15,428
I mean, people are starting to learn that ABCD does more than those core key programs.

1215
01:51:16,789 --> 01:51:17,970
That's good to know.

1216
01:51:18,131 --> 01:51:24,997
And the success of this particular program we're talking about tonight will be based on the outreach

1217
01:51:25,473 --> 01:51:27,374
that's done by your organization.

1218
01:51:28,035 --> 01:51:34,199
And as you know, I think we have a lot of outreach to do to make residents aware of what's currently happening.

1219
01:51:34,519 --> 01:51:45,507
And the only reason why I brought up the other state funding or federal funding is that I want to make sure that Method residents, they may not be aware, but that they're getting a piece of the pie as well.

1220
01:51:46,247 --> 01:51:50,370
And I know the government is throwing a lot of money into this COVID now.

1221
01:51:50,941 --> 01:51:57,884
and there's a lot of money being dished out, I want to make sure that Medford residents have a seat at the table as well.

1222
01:51:58,584 --> 01:52:01,065
And I appreciate all your efforts.

1223
01:52:01,645 --> 01:52:05,547
I guarantee you in three months, we'll be having a different conversation.

1224
01:52:05,967 --> 01:52:15,731
We're going to go full force into Medford and make our existence known and help as many people in Medford that we can help with comprehensive services, not just rental assistance.

1225
01:52:16,131 --> 01:52:16,471
Thank you.

1226
01:52:16,875 --> 01:52:17,195
Thank you.

1227
01:52:17,255 --> 01:52:18,596
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1228
01:52:18,656 --> 01:52:20,077
Thank you, Tabitha.

1229
01:52:20,798 --> 01:52:22,019
Councilor Knight, you're up next.

1230
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:33,407
Mr. President, I'd like to second Councilor Caviello's motion for a 50% funding and then upon review of the usage statistics, a further conversation on appropriating the additional 50%.

1231
01:52:33,807 --> 01:52:41,412
So is the motion from Councilor, Vice President Caviello to reduce it to 100%

1232
01:52:43,943 --> 01:52:45,124
Is it 50% of the 250?

1233
01:52:45,704 --> 01:52:46,465
Yes, Mr. President.

1234
01:52:46,485 --> 01:52:52,588
Then they said these people should know within a week or two weeks how big the need is and come right back.

1235
01:52:52,668 --> 01:52:58,651
And I don't see a problem appropriating the other 50%.

1236
01:52:59,251 --> 01:53:02,213
But like Councilor Mark said, let's see the need.

1237
01:53:02,633 --> 01:53:09,317
And like Debita said, currently the program isn't that known out in her area.

1238
01:53:10,087 --> 01:53:10,728
with her group.

1239
01:53:10,828 --> 01:53:16,237
So let's see what the demand is, and then we'll appropriate as we go.

1240
01:53:16,257 --> 01:53:22,547
Okay, so I want to make sure I get this clear, and Clerk Curtis, please see if you agree.

1241
01:53:24,503 --> 01:53:25,724
There's two points to this paper.

1242
01:53:25,784 --> 01:53:27,865
The first one is requesting the appropriation of $250,000.

1243
01:53:28,446 --> 01:53:31,408
Is the motion to reduce that by 50%?

1244
01:53:31,628 --> 01:53:33,669
That is correct, Mr. President.

1245
01:53:34,149 --> 01:53:37,612
And what about the $20,000 on the second point?

1246
01:53:37,752 --> 01:53:41,574
I don't have a problem with that, Mr. President.

1247
01:53:41,755 --> 01:53:42,855
Okay.

1248
01:53:43,856 --> 01:53:45,037
Councilor Beers, one minute, please.

1249
01:53:45,397 --> 01:53:51,141
So on the motion of Vice President Caviello to reduce the line one to $125,000, seconded by Councilor Knight,

1250
01:53:55,705 --> 01:53:56,345
Councilor Behrs.

1251
01:53:58,106 --> 01:54:01,188
I just, and this is more technical.

1252
01:54:01,208 --> 01:54:03,609
I don't know if the clerk or Danielle could speak to it.

1253
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:12,113
Instead of, by doing it this way, it makes me think that the CPC is gonna have to vote again on another $125,000.

1254
01:54:12,514 --> 01:54:14,515
Is that accurate or not?

1255
01:54:14,995 --> 01:54:16,916
I would hope not.

1256
01:54:16,936 --> 01:54:19,297
They made the recommendation for the funds of 250.

1257
01:54:19,497 --> 01:54:22,179
We're just giving them half and saying, come back and ask for more later.

1258
01:54:22,419 --> 01:54:24,340
They made the recommendation for 250.

1259
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:28,202
Okay, so essentially we're releasing half.

1260
01:54:29,262 --> 01:54:31,684
Yeah, depending on the need.

1261
01:54:31,744 --> 01:54:34,366
If the need's there, we'll give the other half comes right out.

1262
01:54:35,386 --> 01:54:35,647
Got it.

1263
01:54:36,467 --> 01:54:36,787
Thank you.

1264
01:54:37,288 --> 01:54:37,628
Thank you.

1265
01:54:37,648 --> 01:54:43,652
Okay, before I call the roll, any other questions from the council?

1266
01:54:46,564 --> 01:54:47,905
We have a question from the clerk.

1267
01:54:49,005 --> 01:54:54,508
I just want to make sure I've got Vice President Caravello's motion, because I was copying down what he said.

1268
01:54:55,208 --> 01:55:00,190
His motion is to approve $125,000 in funding now and reevaluate after demand is known.

1269
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:01,230
That's correct.

1270
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:01,850
Okay.

1271
01:55:02,491 --> 01:55:02,731
Okay.

1272
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:05,172
And second to that motion.

1273
01:55:06,132 --> 01:55:07,273
Is that also 10,000 for the second

1274
01:55:09,087 --> 01:55:11,650
No, the 20,000.

1275
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:13,132
That stays the same.

1276
01:55:14,134 --> 01:55:16,076
Line one will be reduced in half.

1277
01:55:16,577 --> 01:55:18,019
Line two will remain the same.

1278
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,742
Clerk Hertoghese, have you received any emails?

1279
01:55:21,423 --> 01:55:30,969
I have no emails, there was a resident who was on the meeting earlier who had to get off and he expressed his support for the resolution.

1280
01:55:31,349 --> 01:55:32,470
Okay, thank you.

1281
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:38,633
So are you gonna vote on the 125 now and then the 20 later or are you gonna take the 20 in the same vote?

1282
01:55:38,773 --> 01:55:41,195
We could do it in the same vote.

1283
01:55:41,215 --> 01:55:43,116
We could do it in the same vote, that's fine.

1284
01:55:44,537 --> 01:55:45,037
We can't.

1285
01:55:48,612 --> 01:55:50,573
Two separate appropriations, keep in mind.

1286
01:55:50,593 --> 01:55:53,535
That's right, two separate votes, although it's, okay.

1287
01:55:53,555 --> 01:55:59,178
There should have been two separate papers, but Council Member Marks had one question, I believe.

1288
01:56:00,139 --> 01:56:09,884
Mr. President, just that we'd be provided with any statistics, documentation of what currently is going on over the next couple of weeks.

1289
01:56:10,705 --> 01:56:14,147
And if there is a need for an additional appropriation, that that information be provided.

1290
01:56:15,105 --> 01:56:19,329
So you'd like to make an amendment to the main motion, correct?

1291
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:20,210
Correct.

1292
01:56:24,113 --> 01:56:24,874
I'm working on it, hang on.

1293
01:56:26,035 --> 01:56:26,615
Mr. President?

1294
01:56:28,697 --> 01:56:30,179
One second, Councilor Scott Bell.

1295
01:56:30,219 --> 01:56:32,661
Let me read Councilor Marks' amendment.

1296
01:56:33,662 --> 01:56:34,563
Councilor Marks wants the

1297
01:56:36,493 --> 01:56:44,538
wants the council to be provided with the information on the funding, on the funding tracking, if there is need for additional funding?

1298
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:46,600
The reporting.

1299
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:57,046
So any statistics reporting, number of families, the dollar amount each family got from the first, if you want to call it first allocation.

1300
01:56:57,547 --> 01:56:57,867
OK.

1301
01:56:58,367 --> 01:57:02,570
So then we can make an informed decision if additional money is necessary.

1302
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:04,151
OK.

1303
01:57:06,817 --> 01:57:08,098
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1304
01:57:09,059 --> 01:57:09,799
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1305
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:13,202
If I can, I don't know if Roberta can help, or Tabitha.

1306
01:57:13,622 --> 01:57:15,763
How can we share this information?

1307
01:57:16,184 --> 01:57:25,070
Can we give the people, the organization that contacted us, can we help this by offering an email or phone number?

1308
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:34,597
What's the best way that we can help as a council to spread that word, to get those organizations to come to you, to expedite this?

1309
01:57:39,018 --> 01:57:40,178
Tabitha, one minute, please.

1310
01:57:42,419 --> 01:57:43,559
Tabitha, that's great.

1311
01:57:43,979 --> 01:57:49,001
If you can email us all maybe contact information and we'll get the word out ASAP.

1312
01:57:50,641 --> 01:57:52,662
If you want to give us the information out too, that's fine.

1313
01:57:52,682 --> 01:57:53,542
I just unmuted you.

1314
01:57:53,562 --> 01:57:54,222
Sorry about that.

1315
01:57:54,322 --> 01:57:57,363
Okay, so I can give you my telephone number.

1316
01:57:57,383 --> 01:57:57,863
You can call 617-348-6347.

1317
01:58:10,213 --> 01:58:22,738
And my email address is my first name, T-A-B-I-T-H-A dot G-A-S-T-O-N at BostonABCD.org.

1318
01:58:22,919 --> 01:58:26,220
Okay, thank you.

1319
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:26,640
Thank you.

1320
01:58:29,341 --> 01:58:30,222
Thank you very much.

1321
01:58:31,222 --> 01:58:31,522
Okay.

1322
01:58:33,243 --> 01:58:33,763
On the motion.

1323
01:58:36,685 --> 01:58:37,505
Vice President Cabello.

1324
01:58:39,093 --> 01:58:49,100
to update the amount in point number one here, requesting the appropriation of $250,000 to change that $225,000.

1325
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:55,404
That's seconded by Councilor Knight and amended by Councilor Marks.

1326
01:58:57,285 --> 01:58:58,546
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

1327
01:59:00,587 --> 01:59:01,147
Councilor Behrs.

1328
01:59:02,188 --> 01:59:02,528
Yes.

1329
01:59:03,449 --> 01:59:04,469
Vice President Caravaglia.

1330
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:05,010
Yes.

1331
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:06,191
Councilor Knight.

1332
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:06,971
Yes.

1333
01:59:07,672 --> 01:59:08,192
Councilor Marks.

1334
01:59:11,659 --> 01:59:12,179
Councilor Marks?

1335
01:59:16,543 --> 01:59:16,943
Yes.

1336
01:59:17,463 --> 01:59:17,864
Thank you.

1337
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:18,584
Councilor Morrell?

1338
01:59:18,965 --> 01:59:19,305
Yes.

1339
01:59:20,005 --> 01:59:20,726
Councilor Scarpelli?

1340
01:59:21,126 --> 01:59:21,446
Yes.

1341
01:59:21,807 --> 01:59:22,547
President Falco?

1342
01:59:23,008 --> 01:59:23,268
Yes.

1343
01:59:23,908 --> 01:59:26,550
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1344
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:36,598
On the second portion of the paper, number two, requesting the appropriation of $20,000 from the CPA Community Housing Reserve to preserve, I'm sorry,

1345
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:43,184
Housing Reserve to Housing Families Incorporated to provide rental assistance as part of their pro bono legal services program.

1346
01:59:43,665 --> 01:59:47,588
On that motion by Councilor, Vice President Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1347
01:59:48,729 --> 01:59:49,790
Clerk, please call the roll.

1348
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:51,411
Mr. President.

1349
01:59:52,191 --> 01:59:52,972
Councilor Marks.

1350
01:59:53,753 --> 01:59:55,534
Just before we call the roll.

1351
01:59:57,535 --> 02:00:05,682
Now, the services that are provided by housing families, are they also providing some of the tracking

1352
02:00:06,655 --> 02:00:11,356
that's necessary over the six months, is that part of their responsibility?

1353
02:00:11,376 --> 02:00:13,016
Some of the stabilization?

1354
02:00:20,558 --> 02:00:21,038
Thank you.

1355
02:00:21,458 --> 02:00:27,799
We would provide tracking in an ideal situation if we had a prevention case manager.

1356
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:30,519
We can certainly do that with these funds.

1357
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:33,840
We do that as time permits, but we're happy to also do that here.

1358
02:00:35,143 --> 02:00:36,324
So I'm just trying to figure out.

1359
02:00:36,344 --> 02:00:40,947
So the 20,000 that's going to your organization is for what purpose?

1360
02:00:41,988 --> 02:00:44,929
So this would be to compliment our legal services.

1361
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:55,937
So for people that were involved in a rental or rear edge situation, we take referrals from lots of different places, from other attorneys, from housing authorities.

1362
02:00:56,037 --> 02:00:57,758
We would take them from ABCD, of course.

1363
02:00:58,743 --> 02:01:04,446
And then a little bit of money to resolve the legal situation that is unfolding for the families.

1364
02:01:04,926 --> 02:01:08,467
So we, the $20,000 would go directly back into the community.

1365
02:01:08,547 --> 02:01:11,188
We don't have any administrative money attached to that.

1366
02:01:11,488 --> 02:01:15,870
We're already receiving money to do the legal services through the CDBG.

1367
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:20,072
So is the 20,000 tied to the 250 in any way?

1368
02:01:21,493 --> 02:01:26,835
It's not other than we would receive referrals from ABCD if they had them for us.

1369
02:01:27,827 --> 02:01:28,447
Okay, thank you.

1370
02:01:29,848 --> 02:01:30,809
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1371
02:01:30,829 --> 02:01:31,490
Thank you.

1372
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:36,373
On the motion of Vice President Carabiello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1373
02:01:37,094 --> 02:01:38,395
Clerk, please call the roll.

1374
02:01:39,415 --> 02:01:40,016
Councilor Behrs?

1375
02:01:41,017 --> 02:01:41,317
Yes.

1376
02:01:42,117 --> 02:01:43,098
Vice President Carabiello?

1377
02:01:43,398 --> 02:01:43,699
Yes.

1378
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:45,720
Councilor Knight?

1379
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:46,541
Yes.

1380
02:01:47,652 --> 02:01:48,232
Councilor Marks?

1381
02:01:48,732 --> 02:01:49,052
Yes.

1382
02:01:49,773 --> 02:01:50,393
Councilor Morrell?

1383
02:01:50,833 --> 02:01:51,133
Yes.

1384
02:01:51,853 --> 02:01:52,694
Councilor Scarpelli?

1385
02:01:52,934 --> 02:01:53,194
Yes.

1386
02:01:53,694 --> 02:01:54,414
President Falco?

1387
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:55,014
Yes.

1388
02:01:55,294 --> 02:01:57,775
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1389
02:02:03,297 --> 02:02:03,717
Thank you.

1390
02:02:03,737 --> 02:02:06,298
Thank you everyone for participating.

1391
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:10,990
educating us tonight on a lot of the housing questions that we had.

1392
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:13,251
We appreciate all your hard work.

1393
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:18,112
And thank you to the CPC as well for putting this together so quickly.

1394
02:02:18,132 --> 02:02:20,573
We appreciate all your time and effort.

1395
02:02:21,294 --> 02:02:23,374
I motion to revert back to the regular auto business.

1396
02:02:23,914 --> 02:02:25,035
I motion to Councilor Moxley.

1397
02:02:25,075 --> 02:02:25,615
Second.

1398
02:02:26,195 --> 02:02:29,536
A business seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1399
02:02:29,636 --> 02:02:30,417
Please call the roll.

1400
02:02:32,377 --> 02:02:32,978
Councilor Behrs.

1401
02:02:33,618 --> 02:02:33,838
Yes.

1402
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:36,301
Vice President Carabiello.

1403
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:36,902
Yes.

1404
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:38,004
Councilor Knight.

1405
02:02:39,526 --> 02:02:39,706
Yes.

1406
02:02:40,387 --> 02:02:40,928
Councilor Marks.

1407
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:41,709
Yes.

1408
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:42,711
Councilor Morrell.

1409
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:43,452
Yes.

1410
02:02:43,812 --> 02:02:44,553
Councilor Scarpelli.

1411
02:02:44,794 --> 02:02:45,074
Yes.

1412
02:02:45,435 --> 02:02:46,136
Vice President Falco.

1413
02:02:46,536 --> 02:02:51,644
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes and we will now revert to the regular order of business.

1414
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:57,615
motions orders and resolutions to zero dash three one seven offer by console night.

1415
02:02:58,075 --> 02:03:07,524
Here is all a member of City Council congratulate Evelyn and Henry Miller and on the momentous occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary console night.

1416
02:03:09,085 --> 02:03:11,207
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1417
02:03:11,388 --> 02:03:13,470
Many of us know the Miller and family, they've been.

1418
02:03:14,247 --> 02:03:16,669
fixtures in the city of Medford for as long as I can remember.

1419
02:03:16,709 --> 02:03:31,681
Very dedicated community advocates in their neighborhood at the West Medford Community Center, in the state working for individuals with developmental disabilities, and also very active in the Democratic Party here in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

1420
02:03:32,442 --> 02:03:34,964
Henry and Evelyn have become great friends over the years.

1421
02:03:35,104 --> 02:03:42,130
I first met them working in Charlie Shannon's office when they'd come up and lobby for state funding for certain programs in Madison at that time.

1422
02:03:42,549 --> 02:03:54,195
I'm very happy to have seen the friendship grow, and I'm very happy to see them have 50 years of wedded bliss under their belt, and I wish them 50 more, and I ask my council colleagues to join me in offering this resolution.

1423
02:03:55,076 --> 02:03:56,457
Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

1424
02:03:57,097 --> 02:03:57,817
Councilor Marks.

1425
02:03:59,258 --> 02:04:00,038
Mr. President.

1426
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:02,940
Mr. President.

1427
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:03,640
Yes.

1428
02:04:04,241 --> 02:04:05,802
I'm a little confused.

1429
02:04:06,322 --> 02:04:07,442
The Millerons are only 45 years old.

1430
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:15,971
It was an arranged marriage.

1431
02:04:18,613 --> 02:04:20,574
I agree with Councilor Knight, Mr. President.

1432
02:04:21,334 --> 02:04:26,397
They're two outstanding citizens and I wish them well on their 50th wedding anniversary.

1433
02:04:29,079 --> 02:04:31,080
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1434
02:04:32,101 --> 02:04:33,121
Vice President Caviello.

1435
02:04:33,462 --> 02:04:34,542
Thank you, Mr. President.

1436
02:04:35,143 --> 02:04:39,485
I have the opportunity to thank, uh, uh, congratulate Helena's wife in person.

1437
02:04:39,625 --> 02:04:40,406
Uh, again, uh,

1438
02:04:41,403 --> 02:04:51,825
two salt of the earth people, staunch members of the West Memphis community, and congratulate them on their 50 years, and hopefully we'll see them in 50 more years.

1439
02:04:53,185 --> 02:04:54,326
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1440
02:04:54,346 --> 02:04:55,166
Councilor Peers?

1441
02:04:56,866 --> 02:05:01,027
Just want to extend my congratulations to Evelyn and Henry as well.

1442
02:05:01,447 --> 02:05:02,367
Thank you very much.

1443
02:05:03,087 --> 02:05:05,508
We have Councilor Scott Pelley is up next.

1444
02:05:06,219 --> 02:05:07,660
Thank you, Mr. President.

1445
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:15,702
Henry is a very special person, very close with my dad back in the day and the days in youth soccer.

1446
02:05:15,923 --> 02:05:25,326
And this is a great accomplishment and a great example for all of us and how to be husbands and great husbands.

1447
02:05:26,588 --> 02:05:28,390
And Henry's a great example.

1448
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:34,875
So we want to congratulate them on a momentous occasion.

1449
02:05:34,935 --> 02:05:35,876
So thank you.

1450
02:05:36,536 --> 02:05:37,737
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

1451
02:05:37,757 --> 02:05:38,458
Councilor Morrell.

1452
02:05:39,178 --> 02:05:40,019
Thank you, Mr. President.

1453
02:05:40,039 --> 02:05:42,281
Yeah, I just want to also extend my congratulations.

1454
02:05:42,981 --> 02:05:47,284
Like anyone in the city, if you've had anything to do with politics, you have to go through Henry.

1455
02:05:47,585 --> 02:05:52,989
So I've been fortunate enough to establish a relationship with him, and I want to congratulate them both.

1456
02:05:53,872 --> 02:05:55,013
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1457
02:05:55,073 --> 02:06:07,744
And if I will agree with my colleagues a thousand percent, Henry and everyone, great people, very active in our community, very involved, very nice to talk to, very approachable.

1458
02:06:07,764 --> 02:06:13,169
And we wish them a very, very happy 50th wedding anniversary.

1459
02:06:13,789 --> 02:06:18,714
On the motion of Council on Light, seconded by Vice President Caviello, Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

1460
02:06:22,214 --> 02:06:22,494
I get it.

1461
02:06:22,675 --> 02:06:22,835
Yes.

1462
02:06:23,035 --> 02:06:23,435
Yes.

1463
02:06:23,616 --> 02:06:23,816
Yes.

1464
02:06:23,836 --> 02:06:23,896
Yes.

1465
02:06:23,916 --> 02:06:24,176
Yes.

1466
02:06:25,338 --> 02:06:25,598
Yes.

1467
02:06:38,914 --> 02:06:41,615
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1468
02:06:41,815 --> 02:06:43,396
Congratulations to the Malorians.

1469
02:06:43,416 --> 02:06:47,358
20-318 offered by Councilor Beers.

1470
02:06:47,418 --> 02:07:02,864
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a meeting of the Subcommittee on Auditing, Finance, Budgets, and Taxation, and invite the city administration to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 emergency and economic crisis on the city's finances.

1471
02:07:04,545 --> 02:07:05,125
Councilor Beers.

1472
02:07:05,968 --> 02:07:07,009
Thank you, Mr. President.

1473
02:07:07,169 --> 02:07:17,415
I was quickly schooled by the clerk that I do not have to put forward a resolution for if I'm the chair of the committee, but he thought it was going to be a light agenda.

1474
02:07:17,455 --> 02:07:25,079
So he said leave it on.

1475
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:27,801
But I wanted to, it seems like folks have questions.

1476
02:07:27,901 --> 02:07:30,902
I'd be happy for that to be committee of the whole instead of the subcommittee.

1477
02:07:31,363 --> 02:07:33,144
It seems like that might be the better venue anyway.

1478
02:07:33,993 --> 02:07:37,534
I don't want to put that out there.

1479
02:07:37,694 --> 02:07:39,995
I just want to put that out there and be more than happy for that.

1480
02:08:01,824 --> 02:08:03,125
get everyone on the same page.

1481
02:08:03,185 --> 02:08:06,528
This budget is probably going to be more interesting than most.

1482
02:08:06,788 --> 02:08:08,850
A lot of tough decisions will have to be made.

1483
02:08:10,231 --> 02:08:13,293
I had mentioned it to her and she thought it was a good idea.

1484
02:08:14,054 --> 02:08:15,455
I'm glad you put it on the agenda.

1485
02:08:15,535 --> 02:08:16,196
I definitely agree.

1486
02:08:16,236 --> 02:08:22,741
I think committee as a whole would be the better venue because all of us are going to have a major role in the budget.

1487
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:23,822
We're all involved in it.

1488
02:08:25,483 --> 02:08:28,504
But so I would agree, I think Committee of the Whole is the better avenue for this.

1489
02:08:28,604 --> 02:08:35,246
But I thank you for bringing this forward and recognize Councilor, Vice President Caviello, I believe.

1490
02:08:35,266 --> 02:08:36,387
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1491
02:08:37,507 --> 02:08:38,187
Thank you, Mr. President.

1492
02:08:38,227 --> 02:08:42,228
I was going to ask Councilor Bares to change it to Council of the Whole.

1493
02:08:42,949 --> 02:08:46,830
Again, this is, like you said, it's a very important matter.

1494
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:50,431
I don't think we even know the scope of where it is.

1495
02:08:51,291 --> 02:08:53,012
I've talked to the state delegation already.

1496
02:08:53,779 --> 02:09:01,484
They've already told me that our cherry sheet is going to be light, probably by at least 25% going forward.

1497
02:09:02,344 --> 02:09:13,091
Probably, if you saw the T report that came out the other day, how much they're bleeding, our share of the T is probably going to be going up higher than it's been in the past.

1498
02:09:13,772 --> 02:09:18,535
Schools, I mean, again, I think this is going to be probably the most

1499
02:09:20,828 --> 02:09:25,351
toughest budget that any of us on this council has faced in many, many years.

1500
02:09:26,052 --> 02:09:33,618
Maybe Councilor Marks was only, I don't know if he would, he might've been the only one that faced a budget that was this difficult.

1501
02:09:33,658 --> 02:09:36,259
So again- During the Great Depression.

1502
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:37,080
Yes.

1503
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:39,021
That was very difficult.

1504
02:09:39,142 --> 02:09:45,726
But let's say there was some tough times, but yeah, the city, again, I don't think we know the scope.

1505
02:09:45,987 --> 02:09:47,748
We're going to be a shortfall in our

1506
02:09:49,608 --> 02:09:53,050
meals taxes, hotel taxes, school rentals.

1507
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:58,291
I think we're gonna have to have an overview of where we go.

1508
02:09:58,311 --> 02:10:02,353
So if Councilor Villes would like to amend that to Committee of the Whole, I would appreciate it.

1509
02:10:02,373 --> 02:10:07,174
Thank you, Vice President Cabrillo.

1510
02:10:07,715 --> 02:10:08,855
Councilor Villes, you're okay with that?

1511
02:10:10,188 --> 02:10:10,388
Yeah.

1512
02:10:10,829 --> 02:10:11,409
Okay, perfect.

1513
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:13,632
I don't want to speak on this.

1514
02:10:14,012 --> 02:10:15,874
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Morrell.

1515
02:10:15,954 --> 02:10:17,396
Thank you for bringing this up.

1516
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:24,551
full-time capacity, per se.

1517
02:10:25,872 --> 02:10:30,116
This was our big meeting today and it was scary to hear.

1518
02:10:32,017 --> 02:10:39,062
Maybe my fellow council can help me, but are we up for, is the trash collection, is that contract up too?

1519
02:10:39,683 --> 02:10:43,886
Is that something that we have, and that's a big nut too.

1520
02:10:43,966 --> 02:10:45,648
So there's a lot that's happening.

1521
02:10:45,688 --> 02:10:48,550
And I think that really sitting down with the administration

1522
02:10:49,430 --> 02:11:01,155
getting our arms around everything right now is gonna be imperative to make sure that everybody's custom living, it doesn't change.

1523
02:11:01,195 --> 02:11:06,918
And that's teachers, police, fire, DPW, everything we need to survive in our community.

1524
02:11:06,958 --> 02:11:11,580
So thank you for bringing this up Councilor Behrs and thank you.

1525
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:15,842
Councilor Scott, Councilor Behrs, did you want to say something?

1526
02:11:17,229 --> 02:11:19,291
at the end, after everyone else.

1527
02:11:21,152 --> 02:11:21,933
The grand finale.

1528
02:11:23,254 --> 02:11:23,994
Councilor Morrell.

1529
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:25,776
Thank you, Mr. President.

1530
02:11:25,796 --> 02:11:29,378
Yeah, I just want to echo my fellow councilors, thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this up.

1531
02:11:30,419 --> 02:11:44,110
I know we had talked many months ago about the budget coming sooner, but obviously these are kind of extenuating circumstances where we need a bit of a heads up before we get to that point, not only as a body, but I think the general public, you know,

1532
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:47,391
deserves to kind of know a little bit more about where we stand.

1533
02:11:47,472 --> 02:11:52,434
Obviously, we're down on meals taxes, receipts and hospitality tax receipts and things like that.

1534
02:11:52,594 --> 02:11:55,696
And we operate on pretty tight margins in the first place.

1535
02:11:55,796 --> 02:12:00,779
And as Medford has never done an override, our margins and our budgets are pretty tight.

1536
02:12:00,819 --> 02:12:09,644
So I think just understanding what we're operating with as a body and also so that our general public can understand what kind of things we're looking at in these dire times.

1537
02:12:10,705 --> 02:12:11,065
Thank you.

1538
02:12:12,066 --> 02:12:12,986
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1539
02:12:13,026 --> 02:12:14,187
Councilor Marks, did you want to speak?

1540
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,830
No, I'm good, thanks.

1541
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:17,111
Okay, thank you.

1542
02:12:17,451 --> 02:12:19,372
Councilor Knight.

1543
02:12:19,532 --> 02:12:21,052
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1544
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:28,015
I do think it's important that we continue to keep on track with the pre-budget hearings.

1545
02:12:28,175 --> 02:12:35,538
And the reason I say that is because statutorily, we still have to produce a budget, you know, by the 1st of July.

1546
02:12:35,558 --> 02:12:43,622
And I do not believe that the governor has extended the period of time in which the municipality can put together its budget.

1547
02:12:43,682 --> 02:12:44,382
So I think by law,

1548
02:12:45,749 --> 02:12:50,934
The mayor would have to give us her budget by the last day of next month.

1549
02:12:52,175 --> 02:12:59,881
So I just hope that we can keep on a tight schedule with this, Mr. President, because there are going to be a lot of tough decisions that need to be made.

1550
02:13:00,782 --> 02:13:01,762
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1551
02:13:03,163 --> 02:13:03,924
Councilor Behrs.

1552
02:13:04,925 --> 02:13:05,345
Thanks.

1553
02:13:06,046 --> 02:13:10,870
And I think just something to tack on that we're going to need to have as part of these discussions.

1554
02:13:11,872 --> 02:13:17,437
is working with the state delegation and maybe even the federal delegation to say this is what our need is.

1555
02:13:17,457 --> 02:13:19,058
This is the impact of this crisis.

1556
02:13:19,138 --> 02:13:21,681
This is the amount of money that we're looking at cutting.

1557
02:13:22,862 --> 02:13:26,004
How much of this can we get through a federal stimulus package?

1558
02:13:26,044 --> 02:13:30,348
And I think joining together with our state and federal folks on that is going to be important as well.

1559
02:13:30,448 --> 02:13:31,889
We know some money has gone out.

1560
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:34,872
More money looks like it's going to go out.

1561
02:13:34,992 --> 02:13:38,095
So having that conversation and being able to say,

1562
02:13:38,781 --> 02:13:53,610
you know, we're gonna need something there too, and get as much as we can, because I think when we're talking about the fears that we're all having, I don't think anyone's prepared to make the kind of cuts that, and the numbers that have just been thrown out here, and feel in any way okay with it, so.

1563
02:13:55,552 --> 02:13:56,492
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

1564
02:13:57,133 --> 02:13:58,634
Vice President Caviello.

1565
02:13:58,654 --> 02:14:04,237
Mr. President, if I could just request that the mayor be invited to the meeting along with the budget director.

1566
02:14:05,138 --> 02:14:05,678
Absolutely.

1567
02:14:13,645 --> 02:14:15,045
Okay, thank you.

1568
02:14:15,365 --> 02:14:31,348
On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Vice President Caviello, that we have a committee the whole meeting with the mayor, budget director, to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 emergency and economic crisis on the city finances.

1569
02:14:33,028 --> 02:14:33,748
On that motion.

1570
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:37,349
Councilor Knight, did you have something to say?

1571
02:14:37,369 --> 02:14:38,249
Did you have?

1572
02:14:38,469 --> 02:14:39,049
No, sir.

1573
02:14:39,349 --> 02:14:39,630
Okay.

1574
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:40,690
On that motion.

1575
02:14:43,041 --> 02:14:43,802
Please call the roll.

1576
02:14:43,822 --> 02:14:45,264
Yes.

1577
02:14:45,284 --> 02:14:45,384
Yes.

1578
02:14:45,404 --> 02:14:45,705
Yes.

1579
02:14:46,726 --> 02:14:47,026
Yes.

1580
02:14:47,387 --> 02:14:47,487
Yes.

1581
02:14:47,507 --> 02:14:47,567
Yes.

1582
02:14:47,587 --> 02:14:47,727
Yes.

1583
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:19,903
There are a number of reports that we received on the April 14, 2020 committee, the whole report.

1584
02:15:20,203 --> 02:15:26,004
Mr. President, you also have two tabled motions from last week.

1585
02:15:26,484 --> 02:15:34,987
I believe there was a memorial resolution for Senator Shannon from Council Knight that was tabled because he lost his internet connection at the end of the meeting.

1586
02:15:35,227 --> 02:15:35,547
Correct.

1587
02:15:35,893 --> 02:15:41,536
and there was also a condolence motion for Paul Brogan, which was also Councilor Knight's motion.

1588
02:15:41,556 --> 02:15:43,557
But again, he lost his connection at the very end of the meeting.

1589
02:15:44,818 --> 02:15:48,320
Councilor Knight, do you prefer to take these up at the end of the meeting, or do you want to take them from the table now?

1590
02:15:49,441 --> 02:15:50,361
Go to the meeting, sir.

1591
02:15:50,881 --> 02:15:51,202
OK.

1592
02:15:51,742 --> 02:15:59,686
Let's take the committee reports first, and then we'll close with the moment of silence to memories that we lost in the community.

1593
02:16:01,247 --> 02:16:01,327
OK.

1594
02:16:02,573 --> 02:16:08,235
Reports of committees 20-310, April 14, 2020 committee, the whole report.

1595
02:16:08,655 --> 02:16:19,538
This meeting, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the year 46 annual action plan of public services applications for the community development block grant funding.

1596
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:23,800
Alicia Hunt gave an overview of the CDBG process.

1597
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:30,422
She said that all the proposals before the committee tonight were submitted before the current health emergency.

1598
02:16:31,395 --> 02:16:35,318
She anticipates another round of CDBG funds related to COVID-19.

1599
02:16:35,778 --> 02:16:56,493
There were 12 organizations that came before us during this meeting, the West Memphis Community Center, Housing Families Incorporated, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Immigrant Learning Center, Incorporated, Community Family, Communitas, Malden YMC, Mystic Community Market,

1600
02:16:57,552 --> 02:17:05,175
the Council on Aging, SCM Transportation, Memphis Public Schools, the Consumer Advisory Commission, and Bread of Life.

1601
02:17:07,616 --> 02:17:09,517
Let's see.

1602
02:17:09,597 --> 02:17:13,199
Councilor Knight moved to accept the recommendation to the OCD and to adjourn the meeting.

1603
02:17:13,299 --> 02:17:16,500
It passed on a roll call vote, seven in favor, zero opposed.

1604
02:17:17,161 --> 02:17:26,144
On the motion of Vice President Caviello to accept the committee report, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1605
02:17:26,224 --> 02:17:26,985

Councilor Knight?

1613
02:17:40,742 --> 02:17:41,062
Yes.

1614

Councilor Marks?

1615
02:17:42,882 --> 02:17:43,202

Yes.

1622
02:17:49,564 --> 02:17:51,845
Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

There were two other, another committee report, 19-659 and 20-098, April 15th, 2020 subcommittee on zoning.

1624
02:18:03,643 --> 02:18:15,007
And actually, Vice President Caviello, that was your meeting, that was the subcommittee meeting on marijuana.

1625
02:18:15,027 --> 02:18:16,307
Do you wanna talk about that?

1626
02:18:17,368 --> 02:18:18,168
The brief synopsis?

1627
02:18:19,302 --> 02:18:25,407
Yes, Mr. President, we've held a couple of meetings in regards to the marijuana zoning.

1628
02:18:26,568 --> 02:18:29,550
I think we've got it down to a C2 industrial area.

1629
02:18:31,371 --> 02:18:43,801
We're hopefully going to have the finishing touches put on tomorrow night's meeting and hopefully report it out to the council in the week coming.

1630
02:18:45,572 --> 02:18:46,072
Okay, thank you.

20-042, March 31st, Committee of the Whole report.

1653
02:19:30,781 --> 02:19:36,063
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the senior tax deferment program for the city of Medford.

1654
02:19:36,903 --> 02:19:40,704
This is a resolution I believe that was brought forward by Councilor Morrell.

1655
02:19:41,525 --> 02:19:44,466
Councilor Morrell said that the deadline to apply was April 1st.

1656
02:19:46,566 --> 02:19:50,508
Let's see, she said that the income cap can be adjusted for fiscal year 2020.

1657
02:19:50,568 --> 02:19:51,348
The cap is 57 for 2021.

1658
02:19:51,448 --> 02:19:51,928
The cap is $60,000.

1659
02:20:00,826 --> 02:20:06,729
Councilor Maxwell moved to raise the gross receipt limit to elderly deferrals for fiscal 2021 to $50,000.

1660
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:09,931
That was seconded by Councilor Knight.

1661
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:11,372
It passed on a roll call vote.

1662
02:20:11,972 --> 02:20:14,634

1673
02:20:43,214 --> 02:20:44,175
Vice President Caravaglio?

1674
02:20:44,535 --> 02:20:44,795
Yes.

1675
02:20:45,315 --> 02:20:45,795
Councilor Knight?

1676
02:20:46,235 --> 02:20:46,495
Yes.

1677
02:20:46,955 --> 02:20:47,536
Councilor Marks?

1678
02:20:47,996 --> 02:20:48,296
Yes.

1679
02:20:48,656 --> 02:20:49,296
Councilor Morrell?

1680
02:20:49,736 --> 02:20:50,056
Yes.

1681
02:20:50,457 --> 02:20:51,237
Councilor Scarpelli?

1682
02:20:51,517 --> 02:20:51,757
Yes.

1683
02:20:52,157 --> 02:20:52,857
President Falco?

1684
02:20:53,397 --> 02:20:53,598
Yes.

1685
02:20:53,918 --> 02:20:55,518
70 affirmers, zero in the negative.

1686
02:20:55,558 --> 02:20:56,538
The motion passes.

1687
02:20:57,139 --> 02:20:58,359
The committee report is adopted.

1688
02:21:02,675 --> 02:21:05,857
Can we have two papers that were on the table?

1689
02:21:07,538 --> 02:21:10,520
These were tabled to a date certain, right?

1690
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:13,341
We're tabled to a date certain, they do not require a vote.

1691
02:21:13,722 --> 02:21:18,605
Okay, perfect.

1692
02:21:18,625 --> 02:21:29,011
20-311 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas April 5th, 2020 commemorates the 15th anniversary of the passing of the late State Senator Charles E. Shannon Jr.

1693
02:21:29,764 --> 02:21:35,547
represent a method with integrity and compassion in the state legislature from 1990 to 2005.

1694
02:21:36,587 --> 02:21:49,012
Be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in his honor and be it further resolved that the meeting tonight, the meeting of the Memphis City Council will be dedicated in his memory.

1695
02:21:50,133 --> 02:21:50,613
Councilor Knight.

1696
02:21:52,498 --> 02:21:54,039
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1697
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:58,662
I had the opportunity to work with Senator Shannon at a very young age.

1698
02:21:59,042 --> 02:22:05,425
My first foray into politics at age 19, my first big boy job, working with Senator Shannon up until his passing in 2005.

1699
02:22:05,705 --> 02:22:15,110
I remember walking into the office on my first day and as an intern and sitting at the desk next to me was Consulate Kaviello's son, Richard.

1700
02:22:16,121 --> 02:22:18,964
So, you know, I go way back with the Caviello family.

1701
02:22:19,024 --> 02:22:22,606
Richie and I were in kindergarten together, and we interned for Senator Shannon together.

1702
02:22:22,947 --> 02:22:25,949
Councilman Mox worked for Senator Shannon as well for a period of time.

1703
02:22:25,969 --> 02:22:33,054
But he's someone who I give a lot of credit to for helping me professionally and personally, and he is sadly missed.

1704
02:22:33,115 --> 02:22:39,379
So I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in offering condolences to a gentleman that offered so much to this community.

1705
02:22:39,399 --> 02:22:41,961
He served in the state legislature, elected in 1990.

1706
02:22:43,652 --> 02:22:44,233
passing away in 2005.

1707
02:22:44,453 --> 02:22:49,836
He had served quite a bit of time for the residents in the city of Medford.

1708
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:51,637
He did an excellent job, Mr. President.

1709
02:22:52,457 --> 02:22:58,881
Senator Shannon was probably one of the best constituent service providers in the state legislature during his time as a state senator.

1710
02:22:59,801 --> 02:23:03,503
And that is something that is a legacy that you will want to be remembered.

1711
02:23:03,623 --> 02:23:07,165
So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

1712
02:23:08,346 --> 02:23:09,286
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1713
02:23:09,786 --> 02:23:10,647
Vice President Caviello.

1714
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:12,456
Thank you, Mr. President.

1715
02:23:12,696 --> 02:23:14,278
I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

1716
02:23:16,139 --> 02:23:22,105
I first got involved with Senator Shannon way back in my younger days when I was involved in the youth hockey organization.

1717
02:23:22,125 --> 02:23:27,549
And then the MDC then was going to demolish the building.

1718
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:30,512
I went to then Senator Shannon.

1719
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:41,793
who helped secure the funding to keep La Conte Rink open, and it's still open today, thanks to the funding that Senator Shannon got to keep the building open.

1720
02:23:42,193 --> 02:23:54,536
Going forward, we end up becoming good friends, family friends, and he was a great senator, and again, probably taught me a lot of things that I've learned to make me the councilor that I am.

1721
02:23:54,556 --> 02:23:57,837
So I thank him, and thank council for bringing this forward.

1722
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,066
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1723
02:24:01,106 --> 02:24:01,967
Councilor Marks.

1724
02:24:03,169 --> 02:24:04,210
Thank you, Mr. President.

1725
02:24:05,151 --> 02:24:07,535
I want to thank Councilor Nye for putting this on.

1726
02:24:08,476 --> 02:24:13,483
Charlie was truly a great man, a great advocate to the city of Memphis.

1727
02:24:14,204 --> 02:24:16,447
And a little known fact,

1728
02:24:17,089 --> 02:24:33,397
uh, Charlie was a former, uh, public safety officer and, um, you know, he was very instrumental in moving forward many public safety initiatives, uh, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of which, uh, the Shannon bill, uh, was named after Charlie Shannon.

1729
02:24:34,097 --> 02:24:40,040
Um, and, uh, you know, he, uh, as, uh, uh, counselor Knight mentioned,

1730
02:24:40,774 --> 02:24:43,015
uh, was a big constituent person.

1731
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:52,680
Uh, you know, the first thing that came to Charlie's mind was always how can I assist the city of Method and how can I improve constituent services?

1732
02:24:53,552 --> 02:25:03,157
And I think many of the local politicians took advice from him because that was his number one concern, addressing constituent, the local level.

1733
02:25:04,097 --> 02:25:05,378
Everything else was secondary.

1734
02:25:06,258 --> 02:25:07,619
And he was a master at what he did.

1735
02:25:08,059 --> 02:25:11,101
And again, I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.

1736
02:25:12,421 --> 02:25:13,442
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1737
02:25:16,623 --> 02:25:22,006
Actually, so let's see, if we at this point, why don't we all rise for

1738
02:25:22,485 --> 02:25:23,366
brief moment of silence.

1739
02:25:43,529 --> 02:25:43,769
Thank you.

1740
02:25:46,748 --> 02:25:52,551
We're on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caravaglia, Clerk Hernandez, could you please call the roll?

1741
02:25:53,371 --> 02:25:53,932
Councilor Behrs?

1742
02:25:56,693 --> 02:25:56,873
Yes.

1743
02:25:58,474 --> 02:25:59,335
Vice President Caravaglia?

1744
02:25:59,775 --> 02:25:59,995
Yes.

1745
02:26:00,655 --> 02:26:01,115
Councilor Knight?

1746
02:26:01,716 --> 02:26:01,976
Yes.

1747
02:26:02,596 --> 02:26:03,136
Councilor Marks?

1748
02:26:04,017 --> 02:26:04,337
Yes.

1749
02:26:04,797 --> 02:26:05,458
Councilor Morrell?

1750
02:26:05,978 --> 02:26:06,278
Yes.

1751
02:26:06,818 --> 02:26:07,619
Councilor Scarpelli?

1752
02:26:08,419 --> 02:26:08,659
Yes.

1753
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:09,960
President Falco?

1754
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:10,680
Yes.

1755
02:26:11,001 --> 02:26:13,562
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1756
02:26:15,465 --> 02:26:28,071
20-312 offered by Council and I being resolved that the Memphis City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Paul Brogan on his recent passing, Council and I. Mr. President, thank you very much.

1757
02:26:28,331 --> 02:26:32,733
Yes, just recently we have lost Paul Brogan.

1758
02:26:33,133 --> 02:26:35,154
Mr. Brogan loved the city of Medford.

1759
02:26:35,194 --> 02:26:37,875
He had the blue and white running through his veins as they'd say.

1760
02:26:38,896 --> 02:26:42,137
The father of our cemetery commissioner, Steven Brogan,

1761
02:26:42,783 --> 02:26:49,886
grandfather to Haley Brogan in our clerk's office and also grandfather to Stephen Brogan in our DPW, Stephen Brogan Jr.

1762
02:26:49,926 --> 02:26:50,627
in our DPW.

1763
02:26:51,987 --> 02:26:57,990
The gentlemen, the Brogan family, Mr. President, has long and deep roots in the city of Medford, a great family

1764
02:26:58,473 --> 02:27:02,214
made up of public servants, people that'll be willing to give the shirt off your back.

1765
02:27:02,615 --> 02:27:05,956
But one thing we can always say about Paul Brogan was he loved the city of Medford.

1766
02:27:06,696 --> 02:27:09,717
He wouldn't be afraid to tell you about it and that he will be sadly missed.

1767
02:27:09,797 --> 02:27:19,181
So I'd like my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and offering our condolences to the Brogan family who have been involved in the governance in the city of Medford for quite a long time.

1768
02:27:20,241 --> 02:27:21,141
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1769
02:27:22,982 --> 02:27:25,343
At this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1770
02:27:45,951 --> 02:27:46,292
Thank you.

1771
02:27:49,034 --> 02:27:51,876
A motion to count the night, seconded by Vice President Caviello.

1772
02:27:51,916 --> 02:27:53,037
Clerk, please call the roll.

1773
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:55,579
Councilor Behrs?

1774
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:57,340
Yes.

1775
02:27:58,161 --> 02:27:59,062
Vice President Caviello?

1776
02:28:03,225 --> 02:28:04,046
Vice President Caviello?

1777
02:28:07,975 --> 02:28:08,195
Yes.

1778
02:28:08,855 --> 02:28:09,215
Thank you.

1779
02:28:09,695 --> 02:28:10,196
Councilor Knight.

1780
02:28:11,436 --> 02:28:11,896
Yes.

1781
02:28:12,516 --> 02:28:13,136
Councilor Marks.

1782
02:28:13,977 --> 02:28:14,357
Yes.

1783
02:28:15,237 --> 02:28:15,897
Councilor Morrell.

1784
02:28:16,677 --> 02:28:16,957
Yes.

1785
02:28:17,357 --> 02:28:18,158
Councilor Scarpelli.

1786
02:28:18,898 --> 02:28:19,178
Yes.

1787
02:28:19,438 --> 02:28:20,198
President Falco.

1788
02:28:20,698 --> 02:28:21,318
Yes.

1789
02:28:21,338 --> 02:28:28,040
70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1790
02:28:28,060 --> 02:28:30,561
I believe the records are the only thing remaining, correct?

1791
02:28:30,861 --> 02:28:31,661
I think that is correct.

1792
02:28:32,406 --> 02:28:33,487
Okay, records.

1793
02:28:33,887 --> 02:28:38,570
The records of the meeting of April 14th, 2020 were passed to Vice President Caviello.

1794
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:41,632
Vice President Caviello, how did you find those records?

1795
02:28:43,213 --> 02:28:46,235
I reviewed the records and they're in order.

1796
02:28:46,715 --> 02:28:49,737
Mr. President, if I could ask, indulgence is one thing.

1797
02:28:50,778 --> 02:28:59,944
If we could close this evening's meeting in memory of all the many people who've passed on with the COVID virus.

1798
02:29:00,744 --> 02:29:01,585
Again,

1799
02:29:02,353 --> 02:29:03,813
The great majority of them are seniors.

1800
02:29:04,454 --> 02:29:07,794
And again, there's just too many today.

1801
02:29:07,854 --> 02:29:09,195
I mean, they're dying every single day.

1802
02:29:09,515 --> 02:29:15,516
So if we could close the memory and the meeting in memory of those who've passed away from this virus, I appreciate it.

1803
02:29:15,697 --> 02:29:17,057
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

1804
02:29:17,617 --> 02:29:28,720
Clerk Hernandez, on the motion of Vice President Carviello to approve the records seconded by Councilor Behrs, can you please call the roll?

1805
02:29:31,543 --> 02:29:32,064
Councilor Behrs.

1806
02:29:32,845 --> 02:29:33,105
Yes.

1807
02:29:33,546 --> 02:29:34,448
Vice President Carviello.

1808
02:29:34,648 --> 02:29:34,848
Yes.

1809
02:29:35,449 --> 02:29:35,910
Councilor Knight.

1810
02:29:36,511 --> 02:29:36,871
Yes.

1811
02:29:37,252 --> 02:29:37,813
Councilor Martz.

1812
02:29:38,494 --> 02:29:38,854
Yes.

1813
02:29:39,235 --> 02:29:39,836
Councilor Morrell.

1814
02:29:40,377 --> 02:29:40,677
Yes.

1815
02:29:41,178 --> 02:29:41,959
Councilor Scarpelli.

1816
02:29:42,219 --> 02:29:42,460
Yes.

1817
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:43,542
President Falco.

1818
02:29:44,051 --> 02:29:46,812
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1819
02:29:47,433 --> 02:29:56,357
And Vice President Caviello, why don't we have a brief moment of silence actually for everyone that has passed away in our community to COVID-19.

1820
02:29:56,617 --> 02:30:03,160
So at this point in time on the motion, Vice President Caviello, would everyone please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1821
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:19,440
Thank you.

1822
02:30:23,222 --> 02:30:38,687
And on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, that we adjourn the meeting tonight in honor of those that have passed away from COVID-19 and in the memory of our late State Senator Charles E. Shannon, Jr.

1823
02:30:39,868 --> 02:30:43,409
On the motion that we adjourn the meeting, clerk, please call the roll.

1824
02:30:43,789 --> 02:30:44,410
Mr. President?

1825
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:45,930
Oh, Councilor Marks?

1826
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:47,471
Before we adjourn?

1827
02:30:47,931 --> 02:30:48,091
Yes.

1828
02:30:49,466 --> 02:30:57,369
I would just like to take this opportunity to thank Captain Brennan and Latitu along with the brave men and women of Latitu.

1829
02:30:58,269 --> 02:31:07,833
They were at the Glen Ridge nursing home just recently and brought up some food, which I thought was a great gesture in this time, Mr. President.

1830
02:31:08,471 --> 02:31:12,895
And members of the Meffitt firefighters also did a tour.

1831
02:31:12,935 --> 02:31:31,369
I don't know if you saw it online, but they went by Wegmans in some of the stores, beeping the engines, horns, and thanking the workers that are out there very unselfishly, you know, doing the business to make sure that Meffitt residents have food and all the essentials.

1832
02:31:32,109 --> 02:31:37,153
And I just want to thank our brave men and women of both the police and fire department

1833
02:31:37,793 --> 02:31:49,197
and all the other offices in the community, Mr. President, from people at City Hall to the public schools that are stepping up and answering the call, Mr. President.

1834
02:31:50,017 --> 02:31:51,597
