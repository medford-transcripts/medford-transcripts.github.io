1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:07,814
We have to live with it, or at least, as Jean said, we have to follow it from a distance.

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,656
Or does existence speak for itself?

3
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:19,039
Jean Lévy, the social group Lévy, the total ecology, the economic situation.

4
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:23,821
Are we living in a difficult situation?

5
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,662
Are we living in reality X?

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,144
And then you have to keep distance between reality Y and reality Y, that's what you're writing for your book.

7
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:44,030
Do you have to place reality in order to join them, or is distance enough for the product to finish?

8
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:52,235
Personally, like I said earlier, I'm inspired by everything, but there is a certain reality that I can't talk about with people who are in it.

9
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:57,769
for the most realistic cases, for the most realistic sensations possible.

10
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:06,212
When you are a reader, when you read a book, you can either write it sincerely or you can write it because you don't want to read it.

11
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:14,275
For example, at the moment, there are very few people who are voodooists, and I am not a voodooist.

12
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:19,657
I didn't raise the voodoo, for example, but I have respect for it.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,866
But for me, writing a book that talks about voodoo is a way of talking to someone who knows voodoo and who is a voodooist.

14
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:32,070
So, personally, I talked to voodooists, I did research, I read about it.

15
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,054
For me, it was really putting on the feet of characters that seem as real as possible.

16
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,979
And it's true that I wrote all my characters in relation to my personal experience.

17
00:01:45,140 --> 00:02:01,528
Their writers also have the capacity to empathize, because they can put in their place certain rules that allow them to see the writing of the characters, because the reader has taken the label, it reminds me of myself, it reminds me of my friends, it reminds me of the situation I was living.

18
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:03,849
So all this to tell you what?

19
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,451
It's to tell you that 80% of my novels are fiction, but I'm based on real facts,

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,814
Not only my personal experience, but also the experience that I have all around me, the people around me, so that I can talk to them.

21
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:32,634
And when it comes to topics that I don't want to talk about, I always make sure that I talk to people who have this experience, so that I can talk to them.
