[SPEAKER_07]: Once this item has been chosen, I promise I will inform you about the purchase.

00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:09,168

145

150
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're thinking about e-readers for the library or some additional iPads for our students.

151

[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad that our community is really looking at our schools as a place to really help children learn in creative ways that, you know, the doll is a stretch.

165
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's great.

166
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wonderful.

167
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice giving back.

168
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

169
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,782
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Scarry.

170
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:31,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second?

171
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:31,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

172
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

173
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:37,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

181
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Kretz?

182
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:38,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

183
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:38,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Stone?

184
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

185
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Skerry, yes.

186
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

187
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot?

188
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

189
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke?

190
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

191
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vote is 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

192
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

193
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:50,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommendation to accept gifts from... Meadey.

194
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Meadey Corporation.

195
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Mathenos?

196
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:53,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Martinez.

197
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Martinez Van, I'm sorry, Van Schor to fund robotics team.

198
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Superintendent.

199
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:04,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have with us this evening Carolyn Joy, our Director of Mathematics.

200
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,674
[SPEAKER_00]: who will come up and tell us a little bit about the blockball team.

201
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:12,638
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Barbara Chin, the advisor to the blockball team, and also several members.

202
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,840
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done exceptionally well over the year.

203
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Martinez Van Schor has been incredibly generous for multiple years, enabling them to participate in this wonderful event.

204
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:25,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn it over to Carolyn to give us a greater explanation.

205
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:27,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

206
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:34,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Fan Shui, he is the CEO and founder of Mighty Technologies in Medford.

207
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:51,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is his fifth year when he is offering a donation to the robotics team so that they can compete in the 2016 Ball Ball Tournament, which is held up at the university, up at Lowell.

208
00:07:52,305 --> 00:08:00,087
[SPEAKER_03]: The gift provides the funding necessary for application and registration for the team to participate.

209
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:13,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The gift, again, is to the students, and the students of both the high school and the vocational technical school are invited to participate.

210
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no qualifications to be part of the team.

211
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:21,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a willingness to be there and a dedication to see the project through.

212
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, Ms.

213
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Chen has brought with her a representative sample of students for you to meet from ninth graders up to twelfth graders.

214
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to ask Ms.

215
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:36,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Chen to come up and introduce some of the students.

216
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

217
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:37,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Chen.

218
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Today we have seven students show up.

219
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:53,359
[SPEAKER_14]: There are two seniors, Serena Doe and Chris Morristown.

220
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there are two juniors, Scott and Joe Bell.

221
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:09,029
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there are one sophomore, Scott, and then two freshmen.

222
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,310
[SPEAKER_14]: There are two new members.

223
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's very interesting is that we still have seniors who have already sent out their applications to colleges, but still are very dedicated to moving the team forward this year.

224
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:35,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice to see them kind of learning from each other as they grow in it.

225
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year we came in second place.

226
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking for first place this year.

227
00:09:49,388 --> 00:10:08,764
[SPEAKER_14]: last year we have 23 schools and right now this year I think I look online it's about 14-15 school registered so I'm not sure at the actual game how many school will compete against.

228
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:09,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the date of the event?

229
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:12,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it already scheduled, the date of the event?

230
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, April 30th.

231
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:21,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And this next Saturday, we have the regional workshop that marked the beginning of the season.

232
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,469
[SPEAKER_14]: And that takes about eight weeks.

233
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish you the best.

234
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:27,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor.

235
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:33,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to ask that a letter be sent out to Martinez Von Schor.

236
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:42,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Von Schor has been incredibly generous year after year supporting this, so please express our thanks from the Medford School Committee to him.

237
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:46,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm thankful for the students who made a point of coming out tonight.

238
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, and we hope to see you again.

239
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:56,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor, I also want to express our thanks to our teachers because without an advisor for this group,

240
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't happen.

241
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that this particular group takes a lot of hours and time to be ready for this competition.

242
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:13,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And in MedFed, I want to really tell the community how wonderful our teachers are and you exemplified our best.

243
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your time.

244
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

245
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

246
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

247
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:20,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

248
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:21,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Ms.

249
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuno.

250
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:23,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

251
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:24,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno.

253
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:25,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

254
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:27,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

255
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:27,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

256
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:28,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

257
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:28,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Kretz?

258
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:29,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

259
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:29,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Stone?

260
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

261
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scaria?

262
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

263
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

264
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:31,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Van De Kloot?

265
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

266
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:32,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke?

267
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

268
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

269
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The gift is accepted.

270
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:36,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Ms.

271
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:37,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Joy.

272
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:37,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

273
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

274
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:45,211
Thank you.

275
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:49,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Report on Medford Public Schools Enrollment Demography and Class Size, January 2016.

276
00:11:53,948 --> 00:12:13,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as we approach a new term, and as we begin an opportunity for new members to become familiar with our school system, I thought it would be instructive to provide you with some brief information about the enrollment in the schools, who is our student body, and what are some of the things that we have to face going forward.

277
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:21,651
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we begin a new school term, it's useful to provide this snapshot about enrollment, demography, and class sizes.

278
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:32,997
[SPEAKER_00]: These statistics are basically the fundamental data that we will use, the facts that we will use to determine our program and our budget going forward, both now and in the future.

279
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:35,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's note some of the following.

280
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:42,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall enrollment is 4,462 students pre-K through 12 in all our school buildings.

281
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:48,324
[SPEAKER_00]: There are students who are outside of our school buildings for whom we're responsible, but these are the students in our school buildings.

282
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:52,306
[SPEAKER_00]: This number is down slightly from last year's count of 4,514.

283
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,388
[SPEAKER_00]: The number will fluctuate as the year goes in, as youngsters come and go.

284
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:02,992
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a snapshot of a number that we had last week when we prepared this report.

285
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:10,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Our school population is approximately 65.5% Caucasian, 15.3% Afro-American, 8.6% Asian, and 9.5% Hispanic, with the remainder being of mixed racial origin.

286
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:22,485
[SPEAKER_00]: There are slightly more males and females in the school system system-wide.

287
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,906
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 23.5% of our students whose first language is not English.

288
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:33,329
[SPEAKER_00]: The ELL English language learners student population is 7.8%, but that's growing all the time.

289
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Students with disabilities are approximately 18% of enrollment.

290
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Students are considered high risk by state guidelines of 43% of enrollment.

291
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:51,420
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes disadvantage economically, special needs, people don't speak English as a first language.

292
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:56,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 400 teachers in our school system.

293
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:01,888
[SPEAKER_00]: The student teacher ratio is 11.5 to 1 compared to the statewide number of 13.3 to 1.

294
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:12,811
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.7% of our teachers are fully licensed for their teaching assignments, compared to 97.4% statewide.

295
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:21,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've provided you some charts to look at a little bit, which will give you some idea of, you know, where these things are distributed.

296
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go on a little bit more.

297
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:27,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Kindergarten enrollment by school teacher and kindergarten age fed inclusion designations.

298
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:34,127
[SPEAKER_00]: enrollment by school grade, grade level classification, elementary class size enrollment by school grade level, and teaching.

299
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, middle school and high school vocational school class sizes are good.

300
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,694
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some variation based upon student course selection and specific student requirements.

301
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:52,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Periodically, we will provide you with additional data as the year progresses that will help us jointly plan programs, staffing, and budgetary matters.

302
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:59,599
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the first chart, you'll see how the students are distributed by grade levels.

303
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,899
[SPEAKER_00]: See that on that chart there.

304
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:04,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to take any questions as we move forward.

305
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,882
[SPEAKER_00]: The next chart consolidates those numbers, so you can see it by levels and by specific schools.

306
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:19,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third chart is the elementary enrollment chart, which speaks directly to class size.

307
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:25,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the class size issues are always at the forefront of the school committee's concerns.

308
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,496
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at it, the class size in Medford are exemplary.

309
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:32,798
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better than most communities around us, better than more wealthy communities.

310
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the school committee has made this a very high priority over the years.

311
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's well placed.

312
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:43,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be happy to answer any questions about that particular chart.

313
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:46,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last chart, if I can, I'm just going to finish one chart.

314
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:49,107
[SPEAKER_00]: The last chart is a look at the kindergarten aims list.

315
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:54,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are kindergarten aides, some are part-time, some are full-time.

316
00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:01,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we assign full-time aides in classrooms where there are students who require special attention.

317
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:10,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Part-time normally is in situations in general where there are students who require significant additional time.

318
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:20,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're in negotiations with our paraprofessionals, and because it's a sensitive topic, we chose not to take any time away from anyone.

319
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:25,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some classrooms which are not inclusionary right now that retain their full-time in.

320
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:37,096
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a topic undoubtedly that some of you would like to talk about some more and we should probably schedule some time to talk about it so you can decide what you want to do going forward in the future.

321
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:43,818
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some question as to whether or not the state will continue to provide kindergarten funding for expansion of kindergartens.

322
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,358
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not show up in the next statewide budget.

323
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:51,479
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approximately $143,000 and that's something we need to take into consideration.

324
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,180
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you may have

325
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:58,979
[SPEAKER_00]: the desire to make this a priority and do some other things with other resources.

326
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:04,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be happy to take any questions, Madam Mayor, or I'm happy to entertain any concerns anyone has.

327
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:04,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

328
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:05,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

329
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few questions.

330
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, in regards to the kindergarten needs, could you please provide us a report of what the difference in cost would be to up all the part-time people to full-time?

331
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,383
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my first request.

332
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:34,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, I want to know if the larger kindergarten classes at the McGlynn, with 23 students in two classes, are receiving, both of those have full-time kindergarten aides.

333
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:40,972
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in my introduction, the reason for that is that there were people who were full time.

334
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Class size numbers sometimes go up and down.

335
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:56,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were negotiating with the paraprofessionals union, and because we tried to maintain harmony in that situation, not bump people down or take hours away from people, we agreed to let it stand for this year until a more complete discussion could be had.

336
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So in those two classes at the McGlynn School that have 23 students in each class, there is a full-time kindergarten aide because that's a lot of kindergartners for someone not to have an aide with them in the afternoon.

337
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest to you that our kindergarten class sizes even at the McGlynn are some of the best in the state.

338
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:20,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, our class sizes are one of the best I've ever seen in the state of Massachusetts, and I agree with you wholeheartedly.

339
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:37,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But 23 is still a large number of little ones, and I personally believe that we need to look into having full-time aides in our classrooms, because kindergarten is the foundation of our education, and if you're tying shoes instead of actually teaching,

340
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,238
[SPEAKER_05]: That's detrimental to the classroom.

341
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:47,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my opinion, and I would like to know whether those two largest classrooms have full-time kindergarten aides.

342
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what it says.

343
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,223
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it from here.

344
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure those two rooms are the ones that have the full-time aides.

345
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,726
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be happy to provide the information.

346
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor.

347
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:58,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It says part-time at.

348
00:18:59,007 --> 00:18:59,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, wait a minute.

349
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:00,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it.

350
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:01,889
[SPEAKER_04]: One's part-time, one's full-time.

351
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:02,189
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

352
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to look at this.

353
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:05,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

354
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:06,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuno.

355
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the first two questions were the ones that Aaron just asked.

356
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want a breakdown of the full times and the part time and how much it would cost to have full time across the board.

357
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:28,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to say, looking at the numbers, I know that we like to look at certain things and make sure that we keep them the way we are, but I have to say,

358
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,966
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm looking at these numbers in classrooms, they are incredible.

359
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:35,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came off of a conference talking about this.

360
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had shown them this, they would have been so happy.

361
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:49,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, as Erin mentioned, having the 23 students in a classroom, especially with the younger students, it is something that we really need to look at.

362
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:54,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you mentioned we would have maybe a meeting of the whole on this particular issue.

363
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:57,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing I am looking at is the middle schools.

364
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:08,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking at the middle school right now, and there is a difference of about 30 students, and they keep on climbing.

365
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I know that I've brought this concern up in the past.

366
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:18,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to make sure that we also look at it for the year coming when September rolls around.

367
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:25,708
[SPEAKER_02]: If the numbers are going to be jumping up again towards one school rather than another school, I just don't want to see that.

368
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see it equal across the board.

369
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:33,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that one of the schools does have the inclusion classes.

370
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:34,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, both schools have.

371
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:36,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Both have inclusions now.

372
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:42,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to keep our eyes opened on, especially the middle schools, because I do see those numbers going up.

373
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,176
[SPEAKER_00]: So from year to year, because it's open selection, some people will choose one school over the other.

374
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:59,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Another factor is that there are certain specialized classes which go up and down, special needs, ELL, and that affects it as well.

375
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:04,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to keep it as close as possible, but from time to time there are preferences.

376
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:09,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key for us is not to have the class sizes get too large in either school.

377
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:21,166
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's highly possible that any given year, in a given classroom, or a given school, there's going to be a disparity in the numbers of youngsters who want to go to that school.

378
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:28,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a look at, for example, the Andrews in grade eight, it's nine students less than the McGlynn.

379
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:31,210
[SPEAKER_00]: But in grade six, it reverses itself.

380
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this is a function of choice and what people would like to see.

381
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,392
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to continue to have choice,

382
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:45,934
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that the classes are a good size, but on the other hand, we try to balance it as much as we can.

383
00:21:50,068 --> 00:22:01,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I just was, Mr. Superintendent, when we looked at the kindergarten list, the one that does jump out is that one is a full-time and one is a part-time, and they've got the same number of students.

384
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:05,178
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we could have a further explanation at the next time.

385
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:10,201
[SPEAKER_00]: It could very well be that one classroom may have someone in it that requires more attention.

386
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,683
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be that.

387
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few more questions.

388
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,929
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I really appreciate the breakdown in the data.

389
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:20,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

390
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,973
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm wondering, at the Andrews and the McGlen Middle Schools, how many children are in each class, like in English?

391
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:36,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you give me the total numbers of each class grade, but breaking down how many kids are in the chairs for science, for math, for, you know what I mean?

392
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that information.

393
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've ever broken it down that way.

394
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:46,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We can break it down for you, so it's a little larger report because there's more of them.

395
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:50,248
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, in every grade level, there are two teams.

396
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:58,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two teams will split the numbers of students, minus the numbers of students who are in specialized classrooms for various reasons.

397
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take, for example, the McGuinn in grade eight.

398
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with grade eight.

399
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:11,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say to yourself, OK, in grade eight, there's going to be two groups.

400
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two groups are roughly 75 students apiece.

401
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,653
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, roughly.

402
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:26,838
[SPEAKER_00]: If you divide the fact that there are four sections for each, at least four sections, your class size is around 20 or under.

403
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:27,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

404
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,980
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you an idea.

405
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to minus out the students in specialized classes.

406
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:35,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break it down for you, but that's a quick way to look at it.

407
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,085
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, no, I just needed clarification on that.

408
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:40,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's sufficient at this point, as long as those numbers are

409
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:44,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And each team has four teachers?

410
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:44,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

411
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:45,024
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

412
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hasn't changed?

413
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:48,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And they rotate.

414
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:54,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all three grade levels in both buildings, each team, there's not one team with less teachers or anything?

415
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:56,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We did in the past, but not this year.

416
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,262
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great to know.

417
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So that explains that.

418
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to comment on the vocational school, the number of freshmen this year.

419
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great number to see that increase in students at Medford Vocational School.

420
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's overall increase from last year's enrollment.

421
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:16,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that we're keeping children in Medford.

422
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:23,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of our high school kids are actually going to the vocational school, because our programming is really developing well.

423
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:27,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're making great offerings and great strides with our students in our school.

424
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:31,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you've done a great deal of work for that.

425
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:33,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's great.

426
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I said great too many times.

427
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:36,938
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see.

428
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:38,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy about it.

429
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,360
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

430
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:40,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

431
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:41,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're happy.

432
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens once in a while.

433
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:45,575
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens once in a while.

434
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:50,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to Joe in the background, and he told me that he would come up and talk to you if you were happy.

435
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:50,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

436
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:54,419
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that, yes, the vocational school is growing.

437
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And the integration between the high school and the vocational school is growing.

438
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:01,863
[SPEAKER_00]: We met today to go over even more options to increase that.

439
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:04,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're going to see that grow.

440
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:08,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And next year, I don't believe there will be any ninth graders going outside.

441
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:15,762
[SPEAKER_00]: the district, with the exception of possibly Essex Aggie, where there is a specialized animal husbandry childhood program.

442
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:18,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will further increase that number.

443
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been great work.

444
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:23,508
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some interest in our next meeting.

445
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll see some additional programming, too, coming into the vote.

446
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:33,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of work by administration, by teachers, by the building changes, and by this committee.

447
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a lot of years to work for that.

448
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing the fruits of that.

449
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:42,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe not last, but two more, okay?

450
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:47,779
[SPEAKER_05]: On page one, number three, there are 23% of our students whose first language is not English.

451
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And our ELL student population is 7.8%.

452
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:53,140
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the average statewide?

453
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:59,701
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the average statewide is slightly higher who don't speak English, who are ELL.

454
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:00,361
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 8%.

455
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:02,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're right on.

456
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:03,702
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the same ballpark.

457
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:07,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the next category as well, students with disability.

458
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at 18% of our population.

459
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So special ed statewide is close to 17%.

460
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:11,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

461
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're pretty close.

462
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty much in the ballpark.

463
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that in mind,

464
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:24,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some changes at the vocational school and at our middle schools with different kids going to different places.

465
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:30,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure that our other services are looked at, not just teaching staff.

466
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:39,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Our student services, our nursing, our ELL classes are meeting requirements in better than requirements, because we want better than.

467
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:41,808
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the best we can.

468
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think that we need to look at that too and don't just assume, like if there's a larger population going to one school than another, we might need more nursing staff at that school or more, you know, special education things.

469
00:26:56,352 --> 00:27:00,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also know that we service different students at different buildings.

470
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:05,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know for middle school, a lot of the ELL students are at the McGlenn.

471
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So those children are pulled out for a period of time for the day, but they're backing in.

472
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:16,218
[SPEAKER_05]: In our elementary schools, it's a bigger issue.

473
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:30,805
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one school that a lot of students are pulled out, but when they go back into the general ed classroom, how does that change the numbers of that classroom when you count those students in a C for the other parts of the day?

474
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:33,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that really increases class size.

475
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:39,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the inclusion is done in the general ed areas as opposed to the regular academic areas.

476
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,931
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done in gymnasium.

477
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:46,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done in music and art and things of that type, the inclusionary practices with regard to that.

478
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:50,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in some instances, it's done in the academic areas, but not as frequently.

479
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,981
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are still remarkably low.

480
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That brings more issues to me than what is our physical education class numbers.

481
00:27:58,827 --> 00:27:59,488
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're pretty good.

482
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:00,248
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty good.

483
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to know what pretty good.

484
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:02,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We can provide them to you.

485
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see that.

486
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,651
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty good.

487
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:12,877
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you raised with regard to the nursing services, Tony Vento is here today to talk about the Narcan issue.

488
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:20,823
[SPEAKER_00]: But Tony and I attended the DPH nurse leader program in Marlborough not that long ago.

489
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:24,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And Medford has perhaps one of the best ratios of student nurses.

490
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:29,541
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of amusement, Tony will know what I'm talking about.

491
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:38,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Cichikowski was the superintendent in Lexington, get up and bragged about her nurse coverage, and we got up and bested her, and I said, we're better than Lexington.

492
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:40,509
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was pretty good.

493
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,190
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a good laugh out of that.

494
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We have at least two nurses in every building.

495
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:47,774
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost remarkable with this day and age.

496
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:50,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, to your credit, you added counseling services.

497
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:53,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our support services are very strong.

498
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,680
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always room for improvement, but they're very strong.

499
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to know class sizes for our other classrooms, our physical education classes.

500
00:29:04,163 --> 00:29:14,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because we don't get that data, and I want to make sure that we have enough people in place for our computer classes and our art classes, so those aren't overcrowded and that we have enough staffing.

501
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking at everything.

502
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:25,853
[SPEAKER_05]: District wide rather than just the everyday classrooms, because those classes are really important to the overall full child, which is what we look at here.

503
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,374
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be happy to provide it.

504
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:35,518
[SPEAKER_00]: You noticed that if the number seven was the student teacher ratio, we're 11.5 to 1, the state is 13.3 to 1.

505
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:38,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So that alone gives you a clue, but it's not the total picture.

506
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's all my questions.

507
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

508
00:29:44,821 --> 00:29:46,302
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just on this page.

509
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:56,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Through you to the superintendent, just as a point of information, Roy, how many students in the last couple of years have left our Metro Public Schools to go to either a charter school or private school and have come back?

510
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:01,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were approximately 330 students in the charter schools right now.

511
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:03,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that number goes up and down a little.

512
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,850
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, it was 315.

513
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:15,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come up, it's gone down depending on what's going on right now and people wanting different things.

514
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,742
[SPEAKER_00]: The youngsters at Minuteman, the vocational school, have come down dramatically.

515
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:22,902
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now at 35.

516
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:25,703
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at 50 a year or two ago.

517
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:29,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come down to half that, if not more than half that next year.

518
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:35,445
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, do children leave Medford schools to go somewhere else and find out it's not a compatible fit, they come back?

519
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,086
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to change dramatically.

520
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:45,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect with the vocational school being ascendant in terms of what it's doing, in terms of some other programs we're running, in terms of our

521
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:55,819
[SPEAKER_00]: public relations activity that we're pushing and branding our schools in a positive way, that we'll see more youngsters coming back.

522
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's more options in our schools than almost any other school around us.

523
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes some of the towns that one would consider wealthy.

524
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:06,983
[SPEAKER_13]: To put it succinctly, somebody that wasn't here in September, do we have any students that are here now?

525
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:12,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard for me to tell you exactly that because people do come and go a little bit.

526
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,656
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who've come in and some people that have left.

527
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:19,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially youngsters who come from other countries that moves back and forth very rapidly.

528
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other questions for the superintendent on this report?

529
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

530
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:36,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve the motion as offered by Mr. Benedetto on the cost increase to go from part-time to full-time, the impact, as well as the class sizes for non-gen ed.

531
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:38,813
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, all those in favor?

532
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

533
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:40,274
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

534
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

535
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive and place on file the superintendent's report.

536
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

537
00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:46,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

538
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:46,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

539
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Report on Medford Public Schools enrollment.

540
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, goodness, I'm sorry.

541
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Report on Spring 2016 Park State Testing and Parent Notification.

542
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:06,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I'm going to call on our deputy superintendent, Beverly Nelson, to deliver this report and bring you up to date on this matter.

543
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:10,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening and welcome to our new members and welcome back to our veteran members.

544
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:11,964
[SPEAKER_08]: A happy new year to everyone.

545
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,426
[SPEAKER_08]: MCAS has been our state mandated test since 1998.

546
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:21,148
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some change that's come up in the last couple of years.

547
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:31,312
[SPEAKER_08]: The board of education, the Massachusetts board of education this past November voted to develop a brand new version of MCAS, which they've labeled MCAS 2.0.

548
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And the plan is that this new test will replace the current MCAS test by the year 2017.

549
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So this coming year, this test will be developed by the Department of Education.

550
00:32:49,022 --> 00:33:02,544
[SPEAKER_08]: The new test, the new MCAS, will have different types of questions that will require students to perform tasks and process content at a different level than is currently done with MCAS, the regular MCAS.

551
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:09,913
[SPEAKER_08]: which many people feel has too many multiple choice, too many types of questions where students can guess.

552
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:19,621
[SPEAKER_08]: The new test will be something that is more process-oriented, requires students to perform more complex types of tasks.

553
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:28,968
[SPEAKER_08]: The types of questions that we're going to see on the new MCAS 2.0 are similar to the types of questions on the PARCC test.

554
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:31,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the PARCC test was developed

555
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:34,384
[SPEAKER_08]: for states that had adopted the Common Core.

556
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:43,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And for a while, we were thinking about, the state was thinking about adopting the park as our replacement for the regular MCAS.

557
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:50,795
[SPEAKER_08]: This school year, districts were asked to decide which test they wanted to administer to students.

558
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:52,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were two choices.

559
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:59,640
[SPEAKER_08]: We could either stay with the current MCAS, which is the old version, or we could move to the new park test

560
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:03,439
[SPEAKER_08]: which is, again, that test that was developed for multi-states.

561
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:18,050
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration, with the approval of the school committee at the December meeting, chose to administer PARCC to our students since the new MCAS test, the questions on that test, will be PARCC-like questions.

562
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:25,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we will be able to provide our students with some real practice as we move towards the new MCAS 2.0 in 2017.

563
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:39,099
[SPEAKER_08]: This week we're asking our principals to notify parents and guardians about the spring test, which will take place in late April through May.

564
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Attached to your report is a template, a draft letter.

565
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:45,562
[SPEAKER_08]: We're meeting with principals tomorrow.

566
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:46,782
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll present this to them.

567
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:54,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We will ask that they customize it, put it on their own school stationery, and get it out to parents this week so people are notified.

568
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:57,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Students who are on IEPs,

569
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:02,283
[SPEAKER_08]: may require adjustments to reflect some of the new PARC accommodations.

570
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:11,366
[SPEAKER_08]: In most cases, the accommodations will remain the same as currently for MCAS, but PARC is a different test and there are some differences.

571
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:22,730
[SPEAKER_08]: IEP teams will review accommodations that are part of each child's IEP and will notify parents of any needs for adjustments to the IEPs.

572
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:34,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The Office of Pupil Services will be sending out a letter to parents and guardians, notifying them of these differences, and offering parent information sessions to answer questions.

573
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:38,729
[SPEAKER_08]: This particular letter is also attached to your report.

574
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the next few months, we are in preparation mode.

575
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:53,653
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been meeting with our principals, our Director of Humanities and Mathematics, are working with teachers, giving them access to park-like questions, having students practice,

576
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:56,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure that everyone's ready to take this.

577
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:58,170
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel confident they will be this spring.

578
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We also want to make sure parents have all questions and answers.

579
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:10,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So in addition just to handing out letters, we're going to ask that principals hold forums in schools so that people can get questions and answers answered.

580
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:14,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, you can hopefully review the draft letter.

581
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:23,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we're planning to present this to our principals tomorrow and then to the parents later this week.

582
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:28,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone has any questions on our plan for testing or our plan for notification.

583
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam chair.

584
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:36,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to mention that I've received quite a number of inquiries about this.

585
00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:44,184
[SPEAKER_12]: People being disappointed that in fact that the school committee made the decision to have Park administered this year.

586
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:52,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I just wanted to be clear because when I wrote back to the people and explain that, you know, to me this is a shell game.

587
00:36:53,953 --> 00:37:07,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Mitchell Chester at the DOE was getting a lot of flack about PARC, and so very simply he said, oh, we won't do PARC, we'll do MCAS 2.0, but the questions are going to be very PARC-like.

588
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:16,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel as a school committee member, I made that vote because we would be doing our students a disfavor not to

589
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,371
[SPEAKER_12]: at least acclimate them to the questions.

590
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:21,853
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of those things.

591
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:23,554
[SPEAKER_12]: It's parked by any other name.

592
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:25,636
[SPEAKER_12]: This name is now MCAS 2.0.

593
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:34,866
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I had the discussion one-on-one with people, I think that they understood where we were coming from, but it's frustrating to some level.

594
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:44,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume as usual that this letter will be sent out and it will be translated as necessary.

595
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:45,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

596
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:45,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

597
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,630
[SPEAKER_12]: So, okay.

598
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks very much.

599
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,732
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll take a motion to put this on file.

600
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

601
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:53,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

602
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, do we have any idea when the principals are going to be doing their forums?

603
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any dates or anything like that?

604
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it be at night or will it be during the day?

605
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're going to meet with them tomorrow.

606
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:07,776
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll develop some plans for moving forward.

607
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:10,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it really depends on the needs of the parents.

608
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:15,443
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be more, uh, one particular school, the principal might receive more requests.

609
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:23,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, schools that have more special education students may have more requests, those parents, but we will certainly make sure everyone has a full idea.

610
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, it's very complex.

611
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:28,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you know, they were going in one direction and they turned the corner.

612
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:29,936
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that,

613
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, what we're doing for our students is we're helping them to prepare for the new test.

614
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:38,797
[SPEAKER_08]: To stay with the regular MCAS this year, I felt it was regressive.

615
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:39,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to move forward.

616
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:47,545
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure by the time that MCAS 2.0 is operational that everybody has had some practice with it.

617
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:51,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I believe that decision was a wise one.

618
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:53,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad the committee agreed to that.

619
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we will make everyone comfortable.

620
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:56,273
[SPEAKER_08]: We have plenty of time.

621
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:59,128
[SPEAKER_08]: We will do things on our website.

622
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:10,514
[SPEAKER_08]: We can actually do things, again, live on the web, tape things on the website so we can, for those parents who can't make an informational session, we can have it available to them online.

623
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:16,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will do everything we can so everybody's comfortable with this, including our teachers and most importantly our students.

624
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know Mr. Van de Kloet just mentioned the frustration.

625
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:34,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat on this committee for two years, going back and forth with the Department of Education, and it is very frustrating because, you know, again, I think they think we're fools.

626
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:44,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, you know, I hate the idea that we're using our children's education for politics, but there's a lot of political background to this.

627
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:47,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's a huge,

628
00:39:48,230 --> 00:40:01,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say huge, but there are organizations out there that are trying to focus on maybe not having this, but I'd like to know how many students do opt out when we get the response from this letter.

629
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:03,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Just out of curiosity, I'd like to know.

630
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:04,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe they can opt out at all.

631
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,701
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a mandated state test.

632
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:13,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I think that would be very difficult because if we're going to have accountability levels and

633
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,808
[SPEAKER_02]: half the students.

634
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:24,691
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you have to check into the fact that we by law would have to also send out a letter asking parents if they want to opt out.

635
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:30,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Please double check in that because I know that when we did it last year with the park and the MCAS.

636
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,214
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a little different.

637
00:40:33,494 --> 00:40:37,236
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a time what park has been around it for a few years.

638
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:38,796
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually tested it.

639
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,057
[SPEAKER_08]: We were required to,

640
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,520
[SPEAKER_08]: do a pilot test two years ago.

641
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And then last year, districts could once again select between the regular MCAS and PARC.

642
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them selected PARC.

643
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:58,292
[SPEAKER_08]: We felt that we didn't know which way the board was going to vote, that we were more comfortable just staying with what we had until something different was there.

644
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:06,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the things I think we want to keep in mind, a very important thing, and that is once we get all through this adjustment and moving forward,

645
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:15,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're going to be fairer to our students in how we test them, because it's not going to be guessing and multiple choice as much as MCAS is.

646
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:18,092
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be doing performance-based tasks.

647
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:20,312
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be processing things.

648
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:26,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a fairer test, even though I know there's too much testing and we don't like all the mandated testing.

649
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:31,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for the individual student, it will be fairer in terms of what they're going to be asked to do.

650
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we keep our eye on them.

651
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:34,118
[SPEAKER_08]: The end product.

652
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I want to make sure that we do.

653
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reason I think that we voted for this the way we did a couple of weeks ago.

654
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:48,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want for, you know, if through you to the superintendent, if you could find out about this letter, because I don't want to find out that there are cities out there.

655
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you.

656
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:52,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand because, you know,

657
00:41:52,643 --> 00:42:00,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give the best we possibly can to our students, but I don't want to find out from other districts that there might be such a letter.

658
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there is, we need to know about it.

659
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend that, even though I don't like the standardized testing, I don't recommend that we do have parents sign it.

660
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:19,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It is their choice, but I want to make sure that if that choice is there, we have to be transparent in letting them know that.

661
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:20,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look into it.

662
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:21,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just double check, please?

663
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:22,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I will double check.

664
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:24,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just make it clear.

665
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:25,657
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no opt-out.

666
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:31,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who pursues the opt-out is doing it as their own individual initiative.

667
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just want to make it very clear.

668
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:40,923
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is that the state has not imposed a penalty on the lower grades because, quite frankly, they wouldn't know what to do with anyone who did opt-out.

669
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are you going to do?

670
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:50,610
[SPEAKER_00]: If a whole school opted out, maybe they would zero in on that school and bring down a team to ask a lot of questions.

671
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:59,718
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no official opt-out of this test, and anyone who does it does it, you know, basically as a, if you will, a maverick move, their own move.

672
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,303
[SPEAKER_00]: From our standpoint, we think that

673
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:15,706
[SPEAKER_00]: taking these kinds of tests prepares our students best for the future, because it will be, whether you call it PARC, or you call it MCAS 2.0, or you call it anything else, it's going to be more performance-based.

674
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to give them practice, and we need to give the teachers practice.

675
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:20,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add one more dimension to this thing.

676
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:26,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably a good time to put it in, because this is a discussion about notification of parents.

677
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:33,717
[SPEAKER_00]: This evening, I handed you two press releases that came out of our new Office of Public Information.

678
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,648
[SPEAKER_00]: there is going to be quite a bit of public information on this.

679
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:53,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I'm already working with that office and other people to go to each school and hold time with parents and others, coffee hour with the superintendent, whatever the case may be, to solicit information and to answer these questions.

680
00:43:53,951 --> 00:44:03,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see over the next month or so, or two months if you will, because it may take a little bit of time to schedule it all, we will be out there talking to people to help them understand

681
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:12,241
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on, so they appreciate why we're doing what we're doing, or if they have some concerns, they have an opportunity to express it.

682
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:18,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is the beginning of our way of increasing public information, public notification.

683
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:25,647
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good example of where it will be a very effective initiative.

684
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:32,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that, I know the letter, I read the letter, it looks great, I think it's great.

685
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:36,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that parents get so much information.

686
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:40,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this has to be on here and all the information you included.

687
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:47,874
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, I feel like parents like bullets and quick information and what dates are and those in bold.

688
00:44:48,755 --> 00:45:00,818
[SPEAKER_05]: less is more, and as a former parent who used to get a lot of paperwork, so not in this particular case, but in general, I think that schools need to be aware of that when there's any more notices.

689
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So, or even on the back page, if it was bulleted, MCAS test no longer in place, park test, and the dates that they're planned at each school, as like a preview for parents, is an idea.

690
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:15,862
[SPEAKER_05]: My second,

691
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Our recommendation is possibly auto-call, because some parents just don't read a lot of the backpacked information, and they might hear it that way.

692
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:33,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Any additional ways that we can reach out to parents, we have to differentiate.

693
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:39,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to use all different ways of reaching our parents, just like we do in our classroom with our students.

694
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:44,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So an email if we're doing email blasts,

695
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:48,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I know that some schools are on Twitter.

696
00:45:49,177 --> 00:45:52,339
[SPEAKER_05]: All those methods should be, this is an important issue.

697
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,501
[SPEAKER_05]: We're changing the standardized testing throughout the district.

698
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,323
[SPEAKER_05]: All parents should be made aware that this decision has been made.

699
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:02,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And that communication has to be sent out in multiple ways.

700
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:04,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my suggestion.

701
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:05,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent letter.

702
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:13,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is meant to be a start of a process that principals will pick up and, again, customize

703
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:17,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, in all the communication to parents, the parents need a reminder of this.

704
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:26,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to add one more thing, and that is, and it was in the letter, that there is no PARC for science, and there is no PARC for grade 10.

705
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:31,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So those grade levels and those subjects, science is administered in grades 5, 8, and 10, and high school.

706
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:34,175
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a high school option for multiple tests.

707
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:37,919
[SPEAKER_08]: That remains MCAS, because there is no PARC version.

708
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I anticipate there'll be an MCAS 2.0 version at some point.

709
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:43,387
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just a guess.

710
00:46:43,707 --> 00:46:48,769
[SPEAKER_00]: We also anticipate that some of the questions on the 10th grade MCAS will begin to overlap.

711
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:50,170
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to change, right.

712
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:53,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to understand that it's not going to be the same test.

713
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:05,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Mrs. Burke, I just wanted to mention before when the superintendent was saying he was going to be out, a couple of years ago, the school committee met at different schools.

714
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:09,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that there's a lot of value to doing that.

715
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:21,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And we might do it, you know, maybe over the course of this year, but do it as a plan, not every meeting, because the disadvantage is that then our

716
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:27,310
[SPEAKER_12]: it's more difficult to televise the meetings and have them on live and whatever.

717
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:33,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but if we could talk about that and think about that in the coming year of how we might get around to the different schools as well.

718
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:35,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

719
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:38,135
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

720
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:38,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

721
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:39,375
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

722
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:40,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Passes.

723
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:44,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Report on ELL school population and access testing.

724
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Superintendent.

725
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:49,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, ELL English language learners.

726
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:58,631
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly growing part of our population, significantly needy part of our population in terms of services that are required.

727
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:02,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight, we're going to give you a little bit more detail on that.

728
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:18,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I want to tell you a little bit about access testing, another form of testing, which affects the placement of students in ELL programs or in other classrooms where they may, in fact, be able to take those courses.

729
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:32,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight with us our coordinator, supervisor of English language learning, Leslie Trotter is with us to take us through information with regard to English language learners and access testing.

730
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:38,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening and welcome to the new school committee members and the new mayor.

731
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:39,376
[SPEAKER_01]: How exciting.

732
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:46,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, Mr. Belson already gave you the introduction, so I'll just go right in.

733
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:50,355
[SPEAKER_01]: The access test is ongoing right now.

734
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:53,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll start with that.

735
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a bit exhausting, but we're getting there.

736
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the first year we are doing the access testing online.

737
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:08,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And first, I really want to take a minute to publicly thank all the people who have helped put it together.

738
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:14,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Belson, Central Office, and the principals for their support.

739
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:22,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan Arena for networking the computer labs district-wide and troubleshooting during the actual testing.

740
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:26,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich Trotta for organizing the tech support during the testing.

741
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:30,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Joan Bowen for helping with accommodations.

742
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,883
[SPEAKER_01]: The technology staff, Maria D'Orsi and the library staff.

743
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:38,985
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my test coordinators in each building.

744
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:48,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Teresa Castagnetti has been the first person to have to deal with all of it and she's been really incredible and very helpful.

745
00:49:49,169 --> 00:50:03,821
[SPEAKER_01]: My secretary has done a ton and all of the rest of the staff, the ELL staff, who have had to take their own personal time to train for this new test and to prepare the students and to administer the test themselves.

746
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a big undertaking.

747
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:12,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you've seen in the report that I gave you, access is a state-mandated test.

748
00:50:13,032 --> 00:50:25,163
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for the ELL students in terms of placement, hours of support that they receive in ESL, and whether or not a student can be exited from the program.

749
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:26,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state's very clear about that.

750
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:31,669
[SPEAKER_01]: They must reach certain benchmarks in this test or they do not get exited.

751
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:38,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the thing that we have to go by, along with some other parameters.

752
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:39,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the key.

753
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:42,610
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot exit them until they reach a certain point.

754
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:45,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So the test has four sections.

755
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:48,514
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a listening, speaking, reading, and writing section.

756
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:51,156
[SPEAKER_01]: All academic domains are included.

757
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:55,739
[SPEAKER_01]: English language arts, math, science, and social studies.

758
00:50:56,419 --> 00:51:01,182
[SPEAKER_01]: The test determines the English language proficiency level of ELL students.

759
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the past, our kids have demonstrated very good progress on this test.

760
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:10,054
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see how the online assessment goes.

761
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:14,756
[SPEAKER_01]: We have encountered a couple of challenges so far, but we're getting through it.

762
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, let's move on to a quick overview of the ELL department in general.

763
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We service students in grades K through 12 in six schools.

764
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:30,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So all schools but the Andrews have programs.

765
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:39,263
[SPEAKER_01]: The descriptions of the programs in each building are in your report, along with the approximate numbers of ELLs in each school.

766
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:42,065
[SPEAKER_01]: That number changes literally daily.

767
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:49,829
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had incoming families literally almost every day this entire year.

768
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:51,030
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been kind of incredible.

769
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:55,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Our newcomers, which is the kids who don't speak any English,

770
00:51:56,597 --> 00:51:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: those classes have grown significantly.

771
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:06,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also lost quite a few, so it's this crazy fluctuating situation.

772
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:12,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So note that the Roberts is now over 100 ELL students.

773
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:18,390
[SPEAKER_01]: That includes newcomers and the pull-out kids who are partially mainstreamed.

774
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:37,217
[SPEAKER_01]: The predominant languages spoken by our students, like the handout I just gave you shows, the predominant languages are Portuguese from Brazil, Haitian Creole, Spanish and Arabic, and then there are many, many other languages represented.

775
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,801
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, oh, I already said that, so I don't need to go over that, okay.

776
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:47,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Belson did allow me to add some elementary staff.

777
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:50,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has helped with the newcomers classes there.

778
00:52:50,992 --> 00:52:56,457
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really in good shape at this point, other than space has become a little bit of an issue.

779
00:52:56,497 --> 00:53:05,665
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, on the other hand, the middle and high school for what you would want for a newcomers class, the classes are very large.

780
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:06,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

781
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not anything that the state mandates anymore.

782
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:16,003
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to strongly recommend no more than 14 in a newcomer's class.

783
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:21,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we're over that, uh, and, and a number of classes at the middle and high school.

784
00:53:22,506 --> 00:53:26,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hopefully we can find a remedy for that situation.

785
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:33,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the last thing I wanted to just give you a quick update on is the retail initiative.

786
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:36,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So the retail initiative was a Desi mandate.

787
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:43,630
[SPEAKER_01]: to get mainstream teachers trained in teaching ELLs when they are mainstreamed into their classes.

788
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:46,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been very successful in Medford.

789
00:53:47,573 --> 00:53:55,360
[SPEAKER_01]: After doing a survey last year, I found out that there were still 100 teachers who needed to get the SEI endorsement.

790
00:53:55,761 --> 00:54:00,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to get three more classes taught at Medford High this year.

791
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:02,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So our teachers should be in very good shape.

792
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,561
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my teachers, Lisa Beaulieu, will be teaching the spring class.

793
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:16,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the last year the state will be providing free SEI classes for our teachers.

794
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all from me.

795
00:54:19,128 --> 00:54:22,371
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, I'm happy to try to answer.

796
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:23,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

797
00:54:24,032 --> 00:54:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

798
00:54:25,113 --> 00:54:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I always have questions.

799
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,215
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, thank you for your report.

800
00:54:28,255 --> 00:54:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very thorough and it's very good to know.

801
00:54:30,377 --> 00:54:34,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like an update after the spring is how many of our teachers

802
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: still need SEI?

803
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

804
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:40,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, retail certification in that.

805
00:54:41,421 --> 00:54:45,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd like to know, not directly to you, I want two questions.

806
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:57,309
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, are we in compliance with the state guidelines for the teacher ELL student ratio?

807
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they used to have a more specific guideline.

808
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:03,593
[SPEAKER_01]: They really don't.

809
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:06,648
[SPEAKER_01]: have a particular guideline anymore.

810
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:07,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have a recommendation?

811
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:12,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommendations has always been about 14 in a newcomers class.

812
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:16,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And are we there throughout, even the middle and high school?

813
00:55:16,794 --> 00:55:18,215
[SPEAKER_01]: No, middle and high school we're over.

814
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in every class, but in a number.

815
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: A large amount we're over?

816
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:32,223
[SPEAKER_01]: By a couple at the middle, in almost all the newcomers classes, because that group keeps growing.

817
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:36,493
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe four or five classes at the high school.

818
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:43,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So over means how many students over, do you estimate?

819
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I actually know.

820
00:55:45,154 --> 00:55:53,036
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest class, the most worrisome class is the high school first level kids.

821
00:55:53,056 --> 00:55:56,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So the complete newcomers who don't speak any English is up to 22.

822
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

823
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:03,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we get new kids, we have to figure something out.

824
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:06,348
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

825
00:56:06,768 --> 00:56:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Through you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent.

826
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:11,871
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

827
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:19,116
[SPEAKER_05]: What things are we planning moving forward for the large influx of newcomers?

828
00:56:20,016 --> 00:56:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And are we planning for our new budget to look at these and really look at staffing needs

829
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:34,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And is this so high right now that we need to make a change right now?

830
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:41,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that seems almost, it's not quite double, but it's pretty close to double the recommendation.

831
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's no, I know ELL and DSEE is very vague.

832
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:55,617
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of play and there's not good regs that we have exactly adhere to yet, but they're coming.

833
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not it's there, we're well over the recommended amount.

834
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:04,657
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what we want for our children's education as a district.

835
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:08,801
[SPEAKER_05]: So could you look at that and please come back to us with some type of plan?

836
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:16,828
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about this a little bit, because I think it's important for you to understand that DESE recommends a lot of things that they don't fund.

837
00:57:16,848 --> 00:57:20,031
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at all the recommendations that come out of DESE,

838
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,761
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to put hundreds of thousands of dollars into all kinds of things because they're not terribly realistic.

839
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:32,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, the movement of youngsters to our schools at this point is accelerated.

840
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very difficult to know how many come and how many stay.

841
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:44,065
[SPEAKER_00]: It could very well be that sometime in February a whole pile of youngsters go back to Brazil and change everything all over again.

842
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:47,066
[SPEAKER_00]: This discussion really belongs at the state level.

843
00:57:47,883 --> 00:57:56,274
[SPEAKER_00]: because the state has made a whole series of demands on schools but not provided the resources or the technical assistance to bring it forward.

844
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:58,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not by ourselves.

845
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,562
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal is always the ideal.

846
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:07,871
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly there's no absolute violation of what we're doing.

847
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:14,737
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule is are the youngsters getting sufficient number of hours, not are they in a certain class size.

848
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:23,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that certain class sizes can be advantageous, but if those numbers keep shifting on us, we're putting money in and then we're not necessarily getting it.

849
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:31,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting the right person in the middle of the year to take on a class with that specific licensure

850
00:58:31,663 --> 00:58:32,383
[SPEAKER_00]: is not so easy.

851
00:58:32,563 --> 00:58:33,624
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not standing out there.

852
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:35,224
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go one step further.

853
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:51,450
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's goal was to develop this retail initiative to the point where these youngsters could be more easily included in regular classes because then teachers in those regular classes would have the knowledge to work with youngsters whose language was not English.

854
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,432
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been very successful in Medford and very active in Medford.

855
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:59,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hope is that a lot of these youngsters will progress very quickly.

856
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:06,366
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to predict the numbers of youngsters who come into Medford in any given year is very difficult.

857
00:59:06,866 --> 00:59:09,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a budgetary discussion we should have.

858
00:59:09,888 --> 00:59:16,631
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect other allocations we make, because we're going to have to decide what's more important at any one time.

859
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:19,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we put more money in this pocket or more money in that pocket?

860
00:59:20,534 --> 00:59:24,856
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we're derelict in our responsibilities with these numbers.

861
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:39,580
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal to have the numbers recommended by DESE, but we're certainly not far afield of almost every school district that has any kind of urban rim population or urban population with these numbers of youngsters coming in.

862
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:47,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a balancing act as to what we do, but we'll certainly look into it and give you more information.

863
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: In my experience from being here and hearing it every year, the need is only growing throughout the commonwealth.

864
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:12,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that going forward, we have in place what is in the best interest of the students so that way they get the help as a newcomer and get back into the general education classrooms with the teachers that are trained in retail.

865
01:00:13,038 --> 01:00:17,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's also my goal, but we need to have really good

866
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:22,951
[SPEAKER_05]: beginner classes to get those children back into the classroom.

867
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need staff to do that.

868
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:27,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to keep in mind moving forward.

869
01:00:27,935 --> 01:00:34,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there is a bigger influx coming in, I would like to be made aware of it if those numbers change or increase.

870
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to put that as certainly in giving you this report tonight, that's what we're doing.

871
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:44,927
[SPEAKER_00]: We're telling you this is an area that's growing and we're paying very close attention to it.

872
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:46,308
[SPEAKER_00]: But again,

873
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:53,839
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we've got to plan for going forward because it is a growing area and there will be some tradeoffs.

874
01:00:55,474 --> 01:00:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

875
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:55,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Van De Kloot.

876
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:56,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

877
01:00:57,475 --> 01:00:58,816
[SPEAKER_12]: I have three questions for you.

878
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:02,799
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing you mentioned was the testing, the SCI training.

879
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:09,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to ask about if you said we still had 100 teachers who needed that training.

880
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:13,045
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens if they don't get that training, and by when do they have to have it?

881
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So as of last year, we had 100.

882
01:01:15,687 --> 01:01:15,827
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

883
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:22,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had three different classes going this year, which would cover probably that many people.

884
01:01:23,231 --> 01:01:25,972
[SPEAKER_01]: or close to it, and they can also take courses outside of our city.

885
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:27,233
[SPEAKER_01]: When do they have to have it?

886
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,853
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have it by July 2016.

887
01:01:29,313 --> 01:01:34,716
[SPEAKER_12]: And are we looking for, do we think we're going to get to 100% of our teachers?

888
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:43,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way the ruling reads is if you have a current ELL, you must have the SEI endorsement.

889
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of our teachers never have an ELL.

890
01:01:46,722 --> 01:01:48,684
[SPEAKER_01]: The English teachers don't.

891
01:01:49,324 --> 01:01:51,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while, the people at the Andrews don't.

892
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:54,728
[SPEAKER_01]: But many of them have still gotten endorsed.

893
01:01:55,289 --> 01:01:57,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say we're close.

894
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very close to 100%.

895
01:01:58,331 --> 01:02:00,693
[SPEAKER_01]: How about our music teachers?

896
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:02,435
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to do it.

897
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:04,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Only core academic teachers.

898
01:02:04,736 --> 01:02:10,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a pretty long list, but it basically covers English, math, social studies, science, special education.

899
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:11,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Phys Ed?

900
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:11,782
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

901
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:19,433
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I would just encourage all of our teachers, because I would see value for our other teachers to have this training as well.

902
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:29,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So the newest thing is they have to get 15 PDPs in ESL or SEI content before they get re-licensed next time.

903
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:30,981
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so that's how we covered the other.

904
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:31,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

905
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:31,861
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

906
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:38,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Second question is, there were a lot of newcomers at the Roberts, all together listed now at 58.

907
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:45,901
[SPEAKER_12]: So are some of those students then shifted over to the Brooks and Columbus?

908
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:46,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they moved?

909
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:49,123
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because they don't have newcomers programs.

910
01:02:49,584 --> 01:02:53,306
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm saying after they... Oh, definitely, yes.

911
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:55,308
[SPEAKER_12]: When they are ready to be transitioned, yes.

912
01:02:55,968 --> 01:03:07,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So wouldn't it be... So what we're doing is we're asking a student who is new to Medford and non-English speaking to perhaps be in grade one and two at the Roberts

913
01:03:07,965 --> 01:03:09,846
[SPEAKER_12]: and then go over to the Columbus or Brooks.

914
01:03:10,506 --> 01:03:17,568
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, you're taking them out of a comfort area with people who know them, with their friends.

915
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:26,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And to this population, who might be more vulnerable than many of our other, you're asking to do them an adjustment that other parents certainly wouldn't want their children to do.

916
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:33,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Since we have so many newcomers, why are we exploring the idea that perhaps we ought to have a newcomers

917
01:03:34,513 --> 01:03:37,574
[SPEAKER_12]: program at another school so that we're not pulling them out?

918
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:40,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We've discussed it.

919
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:42,636
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is staffing.

920
01:03:43,176 --> 01:03:46,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have a good newcomers program, you need a good staff.

921
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:47,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're exceptional people.

922
01:03:48,779 --> 01:03:52,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could split it.

923
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:58,042
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that, about having lower grades, upper grades at two different schools, something like that.

924
01:03:58,062 --> 01:04:02,664
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't have a newcomers program at every building because you don't have enough kids to support it.

925
01:04:04,035 --> 01:04:08,197
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have enough kids to need a staff at every school.

926
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:13,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got 58... But that's grades K... No, there's no K, I'm sorry.

927
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:14,359
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 through 5.

928
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:14,359
58.

929
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:19,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it doesn't break down evenly is what you're... I understand what you're saying.

930
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:19,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

931
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually relatively even at this point, yeah.

932
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:22,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

933
01:04:22,682 --> 01:04:25,023
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty comes in the fact that

934
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:39,149
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to concentrate your services in one place, because we're not big enough to have every place have an ELL program, a special ed program for certain types of language-based programs, a special ed program for therapeutic learning.

935
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:41,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to split it up among the different buildings.

936
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Each building has certain specializations.

937
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:46,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we can't concentrate our staffing.

938
01:04:46,893 --> 01:04:48,594
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an economic reality

939
01:04:49,895 --> 01:04:53,716
[SPEAKER_00]: having to add more staff and also space, which is not available to us.

940
01:04:53,896 --> 01:05:06,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the conversation from before, but now as the numbers increase, part of me just says that it's never been particularly comfortable that you're going to ask those kids to uproot, which is what you're doing.

941
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

942
01:05:08,499 --> 01:05:15,720
[SPEAKER_12]: As the program goes, I think it just needs to be always an ongoing question of, are we doing the best thing for these students?

943
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:17,881
[SPEAKER_12]: My third question is,

944
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:22,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the staff feel that the access test is accurate?

945
01:05:23,191 --> 01:05:26,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Do teachers agree with the placements, like when they come back and they get the results?

946
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:30,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we talk about testing, and we've got concerns about other tests.

947
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:33,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a really interesting sort of testing.

948
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:40,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Are your teachers, do they think the test accurately reflects where the student is?

949
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:42,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, yes.

950
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:53,070
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a hesitation because sometimes students with learning disabilities are unable to get beyond the benchmark.

951
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:56,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our American kids wouldn't pass it, to be honest with you.

952
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:59,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy if you get up to the higher levels of it.

953
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:04,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get to a 6.0, which is equivalent to a native speaker, it's a very difficult test.

954
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:13,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some students who either have cognitive issues or reading issues or whatever their issues might be, emotional,

955
01:06:13,822 --> 01:06:20,704
[SPEAKER_01]: who tend to stay in the program a little bit longer than they might if it weren't for that strict cutoff.

956
01:06:21,884 --> 01:06:22,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

957
01:06:22,664 --> 01:06:26,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, overall, we'll see how the online is.

958
01:06:26,605 --> 01:06:28,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm holding my breath.

959
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:32,107
[SPEAKER_12]: But it works that way rather than the other way where students are promoted too soon.

960
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:34,667
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, they're not promoted soon enough.

961
01:06:35,147 --> 01:06:35,207
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

962
01:06:35,227 --> 01:06:35,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

963
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:36,548
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

964
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:37,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Lisa.

965
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a question?

966
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:42,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

967
01:06:43,492 --> 01:06:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we just went over the numbers at the high school.

968
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,735
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the middle school?

969
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:52,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle school has also grown.

970
01:06:52,437 --> 01:06:55,319
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to 50, I think it's 54.

971
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:59,401
[SPEAKER_01]: When I left teaching at the middle school, we were at 38.

972
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:02,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gotten bigger.

973
01:07:02,423 --> 01:07:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: How many classes is that divided into?

974
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:07,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So the class, that's an interesting program.

975
01:07:07,735 --> 01:07:10,698
[SPEAKER_01]: The classes are sixth, seventh, and eighth graders all together.

976
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:15,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on their level of English, they stick with one group.

977
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,364
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the newcomers, the ones.

978
01:07:17,885 --> 01:07:22,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they've been here a year or two and their English is a little bit better, they go into the level two.

979
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:30,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And all classes are, they're basically together all day with different teachers, but the same kids, same group of kids.

980
01:07:30,952 --> 01:07:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a third level where they're mostly mainstreamed into regular ed classes with only English with an ESL teacher.

981
01:07:39,258 --> 01:07:43,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of the 54, do you know what the numbers are in the first, second and third level?

982
01:07:43,962 --> 01:07:44,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

983
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:46,984
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones are at about 15.

984
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:49,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we're getting another one, so that'll probably be up to 16.

985
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:53,509
[SPEAKER_01]: The twos are at 16 and the threes are fine.

986
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:54,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're like 10 or,

987
01:07:55,629 --> 01:07:58,049
[SPEAKER_01]: eight or around that range.

988
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:04,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And going back to the high school, the 22, are we talking, they're all 22 in one class, correct?

989
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:07,831
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the level one language arts.

990
01:08:08,391 --> 01:08:09,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they also divided up over there?

991
01:08:10,892 --> 01:08:12,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the high school divided up in different levels also?

992
01:08:13,832 --> 01:08:14,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, definitely.

993
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So the high school's a little different.

994
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:23,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are also grades that are mixed nine through 12, depending on the student's English level.

995
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have four different levels of language arts classes.

996
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:39,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all the standard math classes, only sheltered for ELLs, taught specifically to ELLs, plus a general math for the kids who come in with very little schooling.

997
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:49,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have three different courses in social studies, one with two different groups.

998
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:51,074
[SPEAKER_01]: World History II has two groups.

999
01:08:53,676 --> 01:09:01,143
[SPEAKER_01]: In science, we created an integrated science class, again, for the students who've come in with limited school background.

1000
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:12,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have an SCI biology, we have an SCI chemistry, and an SCI physics, internal physics.

1001
01:09:12,813 --> 01:09:15,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're saying that we have 22 students in one level,

1002
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:18,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about level one?

1003
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:19,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1004
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:22,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you definitely have the 22 students in level one?

1005
01:09:23,036 --> 01:09:24,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the language arts class.

1006
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and what about two, three, and four, do you know those?

1007
01:09:30,202 --> 01:09:32,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Those didn't stand out to me, so they couldn't have been too bad.

1008
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:39,529
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did was I went through each class number, you know, the class lists and the numbers, and wrote down the ones that stood out that were too big.

1009
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:45,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's difficult because of the mobilization with students.

1010
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1011
01:09:45,805 --> 01:09:52,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the superintendent said, he mentioned something about certain parts of the year, certain students leave, and then they come back.

1012
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:59,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know what the trend, like these 22 students that we have in level one, have they been with us for the year?

1013
01:10:00,056 --> 01:10:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they started last year?

1014
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:02,978
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the trend?

1015
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:04,699
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them started late last year.

1016
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them came this year.

1017
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's left of that group that I know of.

1018
01:10:13,432 --> 01:10:15,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only gotten more in that group.

1019
01:10:15,813 --> 01:10:23,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you see the trend in this particular group that come down another two months or so, all of a sudden from 22 students, we're going to go down to 10?

1020
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:31,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's unlikely with this group, but who knows?

1021
01:10:32,036 --> 01:10:42,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect the fact that ESI numbers are good, but 22 students in a class with how many teachers?

1022
01:10:43,467 --> 01:10:43,607
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

1023
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:44,848
[SPEAKER_02]: One teacher.

1024
01:10:46,019 --> 01:10:47,539
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking how many different languages?

1025
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,260
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

1026
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,481
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many languages, many grade levels, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot to deal with.

1027
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:54,861
[SPEAKER_01]: It's concerning.

1028
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:55,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1029
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:56,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very concerning.

1030
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:57,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that these numbers do change.

1031
01:10:57,961 --> 01:11:09,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that because of the mobilization, we go in and out, but I also do know that over the last couple of years, we've had a lot of students come stay with us and the mobilization really hasn't changed in this particular level.

1032
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend that we do look at this particular level.

1033
01:11:14,468 --> 01:11:25,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could look at, I don't know, at least, you know, if we can't find the money for breaking this particular level up even into two classes, but at least some type of assistance in that class.

1034
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, you know, we brought up the kindergartners a little while ago that 23 students in a class, it's difficult to tie shoes and, you know, put on coats and try to teach them.

1035
01:11:36,476 --> 01:11:38,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the flip side of this, try to be a teacher.

1036
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:44,767
[SPEAKER_02]: try to teach 22 students that are, you know, at a different language level.

1037
01:11:45,628 --> 01:11:46,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That teacher needs help.

1038
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: the mayor through to the superintendent.

1039
01:11:52,124 --> 01:12:04,786
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something that, I mean, I know that we're going to be looking at this at budget time, but in the meantime, budget time doesn't come until me, uh, for, you know, the discussion of budget doesn't come until we really sit down later on in the year.

1040
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:10,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And if these numbers, especially are going to be rising, it's something that we definitely have to look at.

1041
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:14,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at it.

1042
01:12:14,908 --> 01:12:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1043
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to,

1044
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:25,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Paulette, I feel the same way about the kids at the Roberts because that's before my children are presently and they have friends who are the newcomers program.

1045
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:30,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Bellson, correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of times they've stayed.

1046
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:37,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've come out of the newcomers program and come into our classrooms that they don't get shifted to the Brooks or the Columbus.

1047
01:12:40,304 --> 01:12:41,845
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on which neighborhood they're from.

1048
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:42,265
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

1049
01:12:42,285 --> 01:12:44,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was just going to say, they don't all get shifted out.

1050
01:12:44,566 --> 01:12:44,826
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1051
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to stay in the community of the Roberts.

1052
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,729
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're in the Roberts district, then they stay in the Roberts.

1053
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:53,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, they go back to whichever their neighborhood school would be.

1054
01:12:56,853 --> 01:12:59,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

1055
01:12:59,694 --> 01:13:00,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive.

1056
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive.

1057
01:13:01,895 --> 01:13:02,515
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1058
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:02,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1059
01:13:02,936 --> 01:13:03,676
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1060
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:04,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion's granted.

1061
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:04,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1062
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:12,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommendation to accept revised policy on student restrained protocols.

1063
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:19,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So Madam Mayor, members of the committee, special education, as you know, has many, many needs.

1064
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:25,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those needs is to work with youngsters who may need to be restrained at different times during the school day.

1065
01:13:26,303 --> 01:13:31,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain regulations that have been revised by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1066
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:35,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And these need to go into effect immediately.

1067
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:39,335
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee must actually approve the revised protocol.

1068
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,391
[SPEAKER_00]: We reviewed them very carefully.

1069
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:56,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy Medaglio, our director of pupil services is here to present this report and answer any questions you may have.

1070
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:58,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to ask before you even start.

1071
01:13:58,639 --> 01:13:58,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1072
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:07,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we have the changes, but do we have anything that we would see what the changes are like from what they were to what they are?

1073
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: from what we had prior?

1074
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:11,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1075
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:20,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you read the recommendation, um, the recommendation report, it outlines most, most of the regulation was clarified.

1076
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:29,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, different aspects of restraint procedures were clarified and the requirement to report are the significant changes.

1077
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:36,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, in addition, there's emphasis around, uh, intervention prior to utilizing a restraint of any kind.

1078
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:37,865
[SPEAKER_11]: There's, um,

1079
01:14:38,986 --> 01:14:46,429
[SPEAKER_11]: the emphasis on not using prone restraint, which has been proven to be very dangerous for children.

1080
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,371
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you'd like, I could read through the report.

1081
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:52,092
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can do it.

1082
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only thing I was going to ask.

1083
01:14:53,152 --> 01:14:53,192
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1084
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:53,533
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1085
01:14:54,093 --> 01:15:00,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the major, there were several reasons why the restraint regulations were updated.

1086
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:05,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of which is clear evidence

1087
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,515
[SPEAKER_11]: that there were risks associated with restraints.

1088
01:15:09,276 --> 01:15:26,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Department of Education wanted to make sure that all of the regulations around restraints were uniform across all of the different departments, the early childhood, the health and human services, as well as the school age population.

1089
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:33,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of the agencies have revised their regulations to make them uniform.

1090
01:15:34,245 --> 01:15:39,067
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been research around restraints and how dangerous that can be for children.

1091
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:49,251
[SPEAKER_11]: But sometimes it's just as it's necessary that we utilize restraint as a tool to protect children, to make sure that they are safe and others around them are safe.

1092
01:15:50,011 --> 01:16:00,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So the definition of restraint has been clarified and redefined to be a direct physical contact that prevents or significantly restricts a student's freedom of movement.

1093
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:03,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Restraint is an emergency intervention

1094
01:16:04,148 --> 01:16:10,771
[SPEAKER_11]: A student's behavior must pose a threat of assault or imminent serious physical harm to self or others.

1095
01:16:12,112 --> 01:16:16,354
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a last resort after all other methods of de-escalation have been attempted.

1096
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:20,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not to be used as discipline or punishment.

1097
01:16:21,337 --> 01:16:24,958
[SPEAKER_11]: When the student cannot be safely restrained, restraint should not be used.

1098
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:32,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes there are health matters that could make a situation worse if a child were restrained.

1099
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:39,499
[SPEAKER_11]: and should not be used as a response to noncompliance, property destruction, or verbal threats.

1100
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not to be used as standard response for any individual student.

1101
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:59,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that reason, any direct connection or identification of restraint as an intervention for a student has been taken out of all, needs to be edited out of all IEPs, 504s, et cetera.

1102
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:02,733
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can't be the first thought.

1103
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:06,255
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be the last thought when working with children.

1104
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:30,113
[SPEAKER_11]: The goals, of course, were to place emphasis on the emergency nature of a restraint, to align the regulations, to reduce the overall use of restraint for students in Massachusetts, to improve reporting regulations surrounding the collection and reporting of restraint data, to significantly limit

1105
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:37,981
[SPEAKER_11]: the use of prone restraint and to provide guidance to better distinguish between timeouts and the prohibited use of seclusion.

1106
01:17:38,882 --> 01:17:51,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Seclusion is where an individual may have been placed in a location where they would have no access to anyone, like sort of putting someone in a closet, shutting the door, and that they could not see outside.

1107
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:53,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a strategy that

1108
01:17:55,745 --> 01:18:01,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, certainly in Massachusetts, we have not utilized that strategy, but it had been reported in other venues.

1109
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:09,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And so again, Massachusetts wanted to make it very clear that that is not acceptable and cannot be used in our district.

1110
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:22,208
[SPEAKER_11]: There is key elements, increased emphasis on prevention, including individual crisis planning, alternatives to restraint with a focus on positive behavior interventions,

1111
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:27,091
[SPEAKER_11]: staff consideration of known and suspected trauma history must be considered.

1112
01:18:27,872 --> 01:18:46,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, what that means is that schools really need to understand the history, um, for students who may struggle behaviorally and make sure that once again, um, that individuals who could potentially be providing restraint will understand how that may be perceived by a student.

1113
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:50,571
[SPEAKER_11]: There is, um,

1114
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:59,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the prohibition on the use of prone restraint except under very specific circumstances and conditions.

1115
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:11,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we've had anyone who has required a prone restraint in the district, and we certainly would not engage in a prone restraint here in the district.

1116
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:22,825
[SPEAKER_11]: But it could potentially be utilized in other programs with severely high needs or behaviorally disordered children in, say, a hospital setting.

1117
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:30,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Mechanical restraint, medication restraint, and seclusion are prohibited for behavior management purposes.

1118
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:35,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Inclusion of a definition of time out to better distinguish it from seclusion.

1119
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:44,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Staff training programs to include instruction on the impact of physical restraint and the impact on the family as well as on students.

1120
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:53,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Monitoring and reporting requirements include that as soon as a restraint occurs, the principal needs to be notified within the building.

1121
01:19:56,207 --> 01:19:58,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Principal and the designee would then notify parents.

1122
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:00,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Parents receive a written report.

1123
01:20:00,682 --> 01:20:02,202
[SPEAKER_11]: within a couple of days of the incident.

1124
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:07,324
[SPEAKER_11]: The principal must now conduct weekly reviews of individual restraint data.

1125
01:20:07,544 --> 01:20:15,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a report is filled out at the end of the week, the principal will convene a meeting to review any restraints that have occurred.

1126
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:28,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And there'll also be a monthly review so that the principal can see if there are any patterns that need to be addressed within the building, maybe a potential need to retrain staff or to consider revising protocols.

1127
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:41,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we move forward and implement the new regulations, we have provided all of our staff have already engaged in the annual restraint training that is required by law.

1128
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:50,648
[SPEAKER_11]: The administrative team has received a legal overview at the December administrative meetings to remind everyone of this changeover.

1129
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:59,799
[SPEAKER_11]: The principals will now review these changes with staff to remind everyone that the new regulations are in place at the January meetings.

1130
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:11,123
[SPEAKER_11]: DSE has provided districts with PowerPoint presentations to be able to reinforce the changes to assist local districts with implementation of the regulations.

1131
01:21:12,663 --> 01:21:19,065
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to date trained more than 90 staff in safety care training to support our students

1132
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:40,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And principals have identified who the fully trained staff are within each building so that they can be the resource to staff if they have questions around a child who they may have a concern, may require restraint, or they may require de-escalation strategies so that they know who to go to to ask questions on the spot.

1133
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:49,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we move forward, any new staff who are hired will receive the general training as they come in within the first 30 days of employment.

1134
01:21:50,514 --> 01:22:05,021
[SPEAKER_11]: So the attached policy here, physical restraint and behavior support policy, it parallels the regulations and the requirements that each school district are required to implement with the new language of the law.

1135
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:07,963
[SPEAKER_11]: So do you have any questions?

1136
01:22:10,164 --> 01:22:10,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

1137
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke.

1138
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:13,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

1139
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:13,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1140
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:19,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say that this is done very well, Kathy.

1141
01:22:19,271 --> 01:22:19,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1142
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:20,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well.

1143
01:22:20,892 --> 01:22:32,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It really has, it really does completely explain our policy and procedures throughout the district and the fact that we have almost 25% of our teachers, Jacinda,

1144
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:36,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, about that.

1145
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:37,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1146
01:22:37,442 --> 01:22:38,763
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of people.

1147
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:41,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the staff who are trained are paraprofessional staff.

1148
01:22:41,364 --> 01:22:41,505
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1149
01:22:41,765 --> 01:22:50,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we have many paraprofessional staff are key in assisting students within classrooms, playgrounds, the lunchrooms.

1150
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:51,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1151
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:58,834
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there is a call for help, they're sometimes more readily available than the classroom teacher who has students in front of them.

1152
01:22:59,215 --> 01:23:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a trainer of de-escalation and restraint training by,

1153
01:23:05,543 --> 01:23:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I really looked through this to make sure it was done well, and it's excellent.

1154
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:14,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, all your reports usually are very thorough and very excellent.

1155
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:17,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to approve this, and this is great work.

1156
01:23:17,448 --> 01:23:18,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for all your work on it.

1157
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:19,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1158
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:20,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

1159
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:20,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Vander Kloof.

1160
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:21,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1161
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:26,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy, is the security guard trained at the high school trained in this as well?

1162
01:23:29,433 --> 01:23:31,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if he participated in the last set of training,

1163
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:37,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, he was one of the prioritized staff.

1164
01:23:37,493 --> 01:23:40,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I don't have the list in front of me, so I can't reference that.

1165
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:40,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1166
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:43,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just wondered what other groups of staff in particular came to mind?

1167
01:23:43,938 --> 01:23:44,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Guidance counselors?

1168
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:56,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, when we went through the November training, we prioritized staff who had children who were individuals with individual behavior intervention plans or may have been associated with programs where

1169
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:02,871
[SPEAKER_11]: there could potentially be the need for de-escalation strategies.

1170
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:11,076
[SPEAKER_11]: So we wanted to work first with the teachers and paraprofessional staff, the behavioral specialists.

1171
01:24:11,197 --> 01:24:15,199
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually, we sent nine different, nine staff out to become trainers.

1172
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:19,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So now we have 10 safety care trainers in the district.

1173
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:22,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're in the process of doing round two.

1174
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:32,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now they're working on guidance counselors, school psychologists, school adjustment counselors, all of whom have previously participated in CPI training.

1175
01:24:33,262 --> 01:24:36,605
[SPEAKER_11]: But we want to use a uniform program.

1176
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:39,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the need to have everyone have the safety care training.

1177
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,290
[SPEAKER_12]: How about vice principals at the elementary schools?

1178
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,352
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the vice principals have participated.

1179
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:45,313
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all fully trained.

1180
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:57,351
[SPEAKER_11]: The principal group and curriculum directors will participate in training probably during the June, the June and or August staff meetings that we hold after school.

1181
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:58,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

1182
01:24:58,631 --> 01:24:58,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1183
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, thanks for your work too.

1184
01:25:00,972 --> 01:25:02,432
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just ask one question.

1185
01:25:02,452 --> 01:25:02,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1186
01:25:02,812 --> 01:25:05,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Who provides the general restraining training?

1187
01:25:06,873 --> 01:25:09,173
[SPEAKER_11]: The safety care instructors.

1188
01:25:09,913 --> 01:25:10,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are they?

1189
01:25:11,033 --> 01:25:11,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1190
01:25:11,313 --> 01:25:14,214
[SPEAKER_11]: So we, we sent out, we sent staff out for training.

1191
01:25:15,203 --> 01:25:19,266
[SPEAKER_11]: and they became trainers so that they can now provide training to all of our staff.

1192
01:25:19,726 --> 01:25:24,650
[SPEAKER_11]: So they participated in in-depth training on strategies.

1193
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:32,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So the reason why we moved to safety care is because of the emphasis on de-escalation and teaching replacement behaviors to students.

1194
01:25:33,716 --> 01:25:39,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So persons who participated, we had our BCBAs,

1195
01:25:40,547 --> 01:25:45,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had three BCBAs, behavioral specialists, several counselors.

1196
01:25:45,231 --> 01:25:48,073
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a gym teacher, a nurse.

1197
01:25:49,074 --> 01:25:55,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So we tried to pull people from different aspects of school life so that they could then be the resource for the rest of the staff.

1198
01:25:56,339 --> 01:25:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a reason why you don't do training before they enter the classroom?

1199
01:25:59,482 --> 01:26:01,623
[SPEAKER_04]: You have 30 days to do training for new hires?

1200
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:10,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, we're required to do the general overall restraint training, which is primarily review of strategies and et cetera.

1201
01:26:11,143 --> 01:26:16,325
[SPEAKER_11]: But the safety care training itself to become certified safety care is a minimum of 12 hours.

1202
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:21,527
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's... A new teacher just coming into the system, you have 30 days to train them?

1203
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Within 30 days you train them?

1204
01:26:25,068 --> 01:26:28,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We provide the basic general restraint training.

1205
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:37,452
[SPEAKER_11]: That is basic strategies, what to look for, who to go to, basic technique on how to respond in a situation.

1206
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:48,403
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the in-depth training, which includes holds, protective procedures.

1207
01:26:48,423 --> 01:26:50,244
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes into much more detail.

1208
01:26:50,264 --> 01:26:57,230
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, could the training take place before they're placed in the classroom for this general training, not the in-depth?

1209
01:26:59,099 --> 01:27:06,525
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems is that, just saying this in general, is that there's so many retrainings required of people coming into schools today.

1210
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:14,631
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't time in the day, either during this time that they're hired or before, because obviously they're coming out.

1211
01:27:15,311 --> 01:27:23,657
[SPEAKER_00]: If the school of choice where they're coming from hasn't provided it, or hasn't done it the way we would want them to do it, we'd still want to do the retraining.

1212
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:40,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if the part of the licensure that they came out of the schools had the training provided to them, but since it doesn't, it makes it almost impossible to cover all the trainings required of a teacher coming in, this being one of them.

1213
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:44,226
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw some things with ELL, being another of the retail kinds of things.

1214
01:27:44,246 --> 01:27:46,268
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be a special ed requirement.

1215
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:50,351
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reaching a point where there's so many requirements that are there.

1216
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:53,939
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost impossible to do that in front of it.

1217
01:27:54,339 --> 01:28:00,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the most part, the general overview training does take place before the teachers enter the classroom.

1218
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:07,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So, or within that first week of school, because each year the principals are required to conduct a review of mandated trainings.

1219
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:12,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And in many instances that will happen on opening day before the students arrive.

1220
01:28:12,646 --> 01:28:15,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if not, during that September meeting,

1221
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:18,619
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have a new person who starts in the middle of the year, it's part of their assignment.

1222
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,944
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're filling out their employment forms and they're doing the ethics training and

1223
01:28:33,702 --> 01:28:37,083
[SPEAKER_11]: They run through a series of mandated trainings that everybody else has done.

1224
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:38,624
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is part of it.

1225
01:28:39,184 --> 01:28:40,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

1226
01:28:40,485 --> 01:28:42,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1227
01:28:42,825 --> 01:28:44,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point of information.

1228
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:52,149
[SPEAKER_05]: When there's an acting person in the school or in the classroom, usually they call the safety care team.

1229
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:58,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people who have the in-depth training come to that student.

1230
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:02,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And they take over that situation because they're the ones trained.

1231
01:29:03,357 --> 01:29:09,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So the teacher that's teaching that class doesn't necessarily have to have that in-depth training.

1232
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:18,264
[SPEAKER_05]: They just have to have the de-escalation techniques and be able to identify that it's escalating to a point that they need to call for the team.

1233
01:29:19,265 --> 01:29:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if that helps.

1234
01:29:21,706 --> 01:29:22,046
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1235
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:26,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So since I'm standing here, I just did want to announce a couple of parent events.

1236
01:29:26,949 --> 01:29:31,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So this Wednesday, January 13, we have a CPAC event, agreeing to disagree.

1237
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,865
[SPEAKER_11]: how to effectively resolve disputes.

1238
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:35,766
[SPEAKER_11]: That is at 7 p.m.

1239
01:29:35,866 --> 01:29:37,467
[SPEAKER_11]: at the Andrews Middle School.

1240
01:29:38,347 --> 01:29:45,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And on Thursday, January 21st, we will have a special education park parent information center session.

1241
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:53,132
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be held again at the Andrews Middle School beginning at 6.30 on Thursday, January 21st.

1242
01:29:54,132 --> 01:29:57,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will cover what is park, why is Medford adopted park

1243
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:04,724
[SPEAKER_11]: um, for spring 2016 and a review of alignment between park and MCAS accommodation policies.

1244
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:06,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1245
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:06,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1246
01:30:07,266 --> 01:30:07,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1247
01:30:08,006 --> 01:30:10,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Benedetto.

1248
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:11,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second?

1249
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:13,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Ms.

1250
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuno.

1251
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,191
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor of the policy.

1252
01:30:15,311 --> 01:30:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So roll call.

1253
01:30:16,352 --> 01:30:17,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote please.

1254
01:30:17,753 --> 01:30:17,893

[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno.

01:30:18,853 --> 01:30:19,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:30:19,234 --> 01:30:20,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1258
01:30:20,294 --> 01:30:20,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1259
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:20,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1260
01:30:20,735 --> 01:30:21,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Fritz.

1261
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:21,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1262
01:30:21,868 --> 01:30:22,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Stone?

1263
01:30:22,569 --> 01:30:22,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1264
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:23,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scherry?

1265
01:30:23,109 --> 01:30:23,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1266
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:24,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Vander Kloot?

1267
01:30:24,311 --> 01:30:24,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1268
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:25,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke?

1269
01:30:25,452 --> 01:30:25,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1270
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 in the affirmative, 10 in the negative.

1271
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:29,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The recommendation passes for the policy.

1272
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:36,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommendation to approve the protocols and procedures for school nurse management of potential life-threatening opiate overdose.

1273
01:30:37,143 --> 01:30:37,924
Mr. Superintendent.

1274
01:30:38,492 --> 01:30:44,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, obviously this is a topic that we've had previous discussions about.

1275
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:52,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And the school committee authorized our staff to go out and actually acquire the Narcan and to do the training.

1276
01:30:53,068 --> 01:30:58,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight we're going to get an update from Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services.

1277
01:30:58,775 --> 01:31:01,676
[SPEAKER_00]: But before Tony gets into it, I just want to bring you a quick update.

1278
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:14,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the governor announced an $85,000 grant to the city of Medford for five-year periods, a year for five years, to assist with opiate addiction prevention programs.

1279
01:31:14,963 --> 01:31:24,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And also today, the House announced that it was prepared to pass legislation that was somewhat similar to the governor's bill.

1280
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:28,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Not totally similar, but somewhat similar, on sometime on Wednesday.

1281
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,511
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate has already passed a bill.

1282
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:33,512
[SPEAKER_00]: It differs from the House bill.

1283
01:31:33,532 --> 01:31:36,813
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate bill requires screening at the public school level.

1284
01:31:36,873 --> 01:31:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have to resolve that in conference committee.

1285
01:31:39,195 --> 01:31:45,458
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of action on the bill with regard to opiate prevention and intervention activities.

1286
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:48,640
[SPEAKER_00]: But tonight, Tony is here to tell us about

1287
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:55,943
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we put in place based on our last vote to implement this system.

1288
01:31:57,124 --> 01:31:57,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1289
01:31:59,385 --> 01:32:07,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So as Superintendent Belson said, in November I was here and presented a lot of information about opioid abuse.

1290
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:17,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody had a packet that they reviewed and strategies that we can employ on the preventative and the intervention sides of that for our students and our community.

1291
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:25,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that meeting, um, Mayor McGlynn and the school committee overwhelmingly supported for the school nurses to be trained in Narcan.

1292
01:32:26,422 --> 01:32:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, given that in December we conducted Narcan training.

1293
01:32:30,284 --> 01:32:35,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it was presented to the school nurses by a representative from Armstrong ambulance.

1294
01:32:36,169 --> 01:32:42,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and they are very skilled and often, um, administering Narcan in our community.

1295
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:47,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So we gained a lot from their experience, um, in, in that procedure.

1296
01:32:48,783 --> 01:33:00,909
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Kristen Goodell, our school physician, and I wrote a protocol and procedures for school nurse management of potential life-threatening opioid overdoses.

1297
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:07,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We strictly followed the Department of Public Health recommendations and guidelines in this protocol.

1298
01:33:10,699 --> 01:33:26,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you read through it, everything is very clearly marked out for how a school nurse would proceed in determining if a person was suffering from a potential overdose, and then what steps to take to support that.

1299
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have one quick question.

1300
01:33:34,688 --> 01:33:34,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1301
01:33:35,729 --> 01:33:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Are our high school nurses and middle school nurses, is there someone in the building most times that have this training?

1302
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:44,594
[SPEAKER_09]: The entire nursing staff was trained.

1303
01:33:44,895 --> 01:33:45,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody?

1304
01:33:45,275 --> 01:33:48,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody, including the elementary level nurses.

1305
01:33:48,377 --> 01:33:52,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Because while we may not expect an elementary student to be

1306
01:33:53,816 --> 01:33:59,759
[SPEAKER_09]: In that situation, we don't know if a parent may be in the building.

1307
01:33:59,819 --> 01:34:03,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know if somebody in the community would be on school grounds.

1308
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:12,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And a school personnel would be notified that there's somebody on the playground or on the school grounds that needs assistance.

1309
01:34:13,206 --> 01:34:15,907
[SPEAKER_09]: So at every level, all school nurses were trained.

1310
01:34:16,528 --> 01:34:17,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you very much.

1311
01:34:17,768 --> 01:34:18,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1312
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:20,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other questions, Ms.

1313
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Vento?

1314
01:34:22,935 --> 01:34:23,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1315
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:23,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1316
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:23,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1317
01:34:23,396 --> 01:34:23,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1318
01:34:23,556 --> 01:34:23,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1319
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:46,672
[SPEAKER_04]: um, strong ambulance training to your nurses.

1320
01:34:47,013 --> 01:34:47,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1321
01:34:47,553 --> 01:34:48,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1322
01:34:48,334 --> 01:34:48,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1323
01:34:48,854 --> 01:35:10,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go on the next item, while Tony is here, just inform the committee that tomorrow, uh, Tony and members of the police department and the fire department are going to Lexington, uh, to participate in a multi hazard training program over two days, dealing with our updates on how we respond to multi hazards.

1324
01:35:10,572 --> 01:35:13,134
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a report after the training is done.

1325
01:35:13,896 --> 01:35:19,779
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you some of the latest things that have been recommended or the changes that we will look at in our policy.

1326
01:35:19,799 --> 01:35:28,383
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the next two days, they'll be spending time looking at all the things that can happen, whether they be violence-related, natural disaster,

1327
01:35:29,443 --> 01:35:36,448
[SPEAKER_00]: fires, any kind of thing that might affect a school or a school environment going forward.

1328
01:35:36,488 --> 01:35:44,893
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that this is getting very sophisticated, very complicated, this whole health field, because basically people have to be up on almost everything.

1329
01:35:45,834 --> 01:35:47,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just opiate.

1330
01:35:47,135 --> 01:35:51,697
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be combinations of factors that are actually affecting an environment.

1331
01:35:52,378 --> 01:35:56,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's rare that these things happen, but it's not rare if it happens in your neighborhood.

1332
01:35:57,281 --> 01:35:58,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in your school.

1333
01:35:59,205 --> 01:36:09,829
[SPEAKER_00]: We stay on top of it and Tony will be leading the team of police and fire tomorrow and the next day to go over our multi-hazard response programs.

1334
01:36:10,289 --> 01:36:12,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So we better send her home.

1335
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:14,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Two long days.

1336
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1337
01:36:17,919 --> 01:36:22,942
[SPEAKER_04]: report on March 1st, 2016, Professional Development Day, Superintendent.

1338
01:36:22,962 --> 01:36:30,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Deputy Superintendent to tell you about our March 1st Professional Development Day.

1339
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:37,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We have in our contract, our teacher's contract, two days, two mandated days of professional development.

1340
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:42,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually we schedule these days on the calendar at the very beginning of school.

1341
01:36:43,473 --> 01:36:45,134
[SPEAKER_08]: This year we scheduled one.

1342
01:36:45,414 --> 01:36:46,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It was November 3rd.

1343
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very productive day.

1344
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:57,025
[SPEAKER_08]: We had input from the Medford Teachers Association based on what they thought teachers would like to hear about.

1345
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:00,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And we focused on several district initiatives.

1346
01:37:00,687 --> 01:37:06,130
[SPEAKER_08]: TeachPoint, which is the new education evaluation tool management system we're using.

1347
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:09,911
[SPEAKER_08]: We did some workshops on instructional technology.

1348
01:37:10,532 --> 01:37:16,675
[SPEAKER_08]: We reviewed School Brains, which is going to be the new student management system that is coming into play.

1349
01:37:17,195 --> 01:37:18,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very productive day.

1350
01:37:18,376 --> 01:37:20,237
[SPEAKER_08]: We touched upon several different topics.

1351
01:37:21,358 --> 01:37:25,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't schedule the second day because we were waiting to see what happened with the weather.

1352
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:31,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, last year we had a lot of snow days and we went almost to the very end of June.

1353
01:37:32,147 --> 01:37:38,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't really want to schedule a professional development day and use up a student day until we knew what

1354
01:37:39,344 --> 01:37:40,965
[SPEAKER_08]: the weather was going to be like.

1355
01:37:41,186 --> 01:37:58,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And our plan was that if we really had a winter again, that we were using all of our days at the very end for students, that then after students left, we would have our professional development day for teachers, because teachers by contract go longer than our students, 180 days.

1356
01:37:58,561 --> 01:37:59,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was our thinking.

1357
01:38:00,002 --> 01:38:07,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we're moving into the winter, and things seem to be going okay so far, we'll keep the fingers crossed,

1358
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:17,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we started before Labor Day, so we have some extra time, and we feel fairly confident now that we can schedule that second day for March 1st.

1359
01:38:18,377 --> 01:38:19,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's our plan.

1360
01:38:19,878 --> 01:38:21,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, we're still on the report.

1361
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we mentioned that all events will be held at Medford High School.

1362
01:38:25,243 --> 01:38:26,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We're kind of rethinking that a little bit.

1363
01:38:27,084 --> 01:38:31,188
[SPEAKER_08]: We're meeting with our principals tomorrow, brainstorming some of the topics.

1364
01:38:31,228 --> 01:38:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many things that have been put forward, but we need to prioritize what's important since we have

1365
01:38:36,955 --> 01:38:38,836
[SPEAKER_08]: such limited time for professional development.

1366
01:38:38,876 --> 01:38:51,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, with this, we will notify the principals tomorrow to notify the parents that there is no school, there will be no school for students on March 1st, and the teachers that they will have their full day of professional development on that day.

1367
01:38:51,722 --> 01:38:53,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?

1368
01:38:55,124 --> 01:38:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1369
01:38:56,785 --> 01:38:58,706
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1370
01:38:58,786 --> 01:38:59,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1371
01:38:59,426 --> 01:39:00,307
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1372
01:39:00,327 --> 01:39:02,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Papers received.

1373
01:39:03,405 --> 01:39:09,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Item 9, negotiations in legal matter, a motion to suspend the rules offered by Mr. Skerry to place this at the end of the agenda.

1374
01:39:10,055 --> 01:39:10,756
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1375
01:39:10,956 --> 01:39:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1376
01:39:11,377 --> 01:39:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1377
01:39:12,078 --> 01:39:13,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Suspension is granted.

1378
01:39:15,603 --> 01:39:16,605
[SPEAKER_04]: All business, none.

1379
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:18,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Communications, none.

1380
01:39:19,588 --> 01:39:20,809
[SPEAKER_04]: School Committee Resolution.

1381
01:39:21,349 --> 01:39:34,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Benjamin Nickerson, who then was a 1995 graduate of Medford High School, who was the son of Jane Pompeo and the grandson of the late Alfred Pompeo, Sr., who served on this board.

1382
01:39:36,311 --> 01:39:43,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, school committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Judge Henry Tamponi.

1383
01:39:43,438 --> 01:39:47,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Judge Tamponi was a graduate of Medford High School, where he was an outstanding soccer player.

1384
01:39:47,623 --> 01:39:53,709
[SPEAKER_04]: He served for many years as Justice at the Somerville District Court, where he acquired a reputation of tough, but severe.

1385
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:55,991
[SPEAKER_04]: All please rise for a moment of silence.

1386
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Shannon has a few announcements for us.

1387
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:17,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we move forward, during this moment, I'd also like to show some support to a very dear friend of mine who's living with cancer.

1388
01:40:17,782 --> 01:40:26,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And her friends and family are all taking pictures at different areas throughout the community to show our love and support.

1389
01:40:26,144 --> 01:40:29,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So to Mary Pierce, I wish you luck in your battle.

1390
01:40:29,785 --> 01:40:31,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to say, Pierce strong.

1391
01:40:40,597 --> 01:40:45,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, you don't have to stand up while I'm talking.

1392
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:48,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

1393
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:53,621
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things you have to pay attention to.

1394
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:57,642
[SPEAKER_00]: In your packets, I provided you with a copy of the open meeting law.

1395
01:40:58,422 --> 01:41:08,745
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to read that over very carefully, and you need to sign at the end of it that you have read it and you are certifying that you are aware of the rules in that, and I need the copies back.

1396
01:41:13,022 --> 01:41:21,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Second matter is that I've also provided you with the Ethics Commission's requirement to take the ethics online exam.

1397
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:24,914
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't done it in the last two years, you need to do it again.

1398
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:27,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a requirement of law.

1399
01:41:27,717 --> 01:41:29,018
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it online.

1400
01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:32,862
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need assistance doing that, come into our offices.

1401
01:41:32,902 --> 01:41:35,224
[SPEAKER_00]: We can assist you with that going through.

1402
01:41:35,244 --> 01:41:36,665
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the third.

1403
01:41:37,596 --> 01:41:47,344
[SPEAKER_00]: For new members, it's important that we talk about the chart, the course requirement, which is an eight hour requirement of law.

1404
01:41:48,044 --> 01:41:49,585
[SPEAKER_00]: MASC provides a course.

1405
01:41:49,605 --> 01:41:54,509
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options as well, but it must be completed within the first year of your service.

1406
01:41:55,069 --> 01:42:03,256
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done at a conference, or it can be done through one of the MASC conferences, or it can be done through actually one of their specialized programs.

1407
01:42:03,843 --> 01:42:07,726
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that individually as to what's most convenient for you.

1408
01:42:08,267 --> 01:42:13,811
[SPEAKER_00]: It's advantageous to become familiar with these rules governing school operations.

1409
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:22,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, in many instances, to talk to colleagues from other districts who may provide you with perspectives on how they feel the best way is to conduct business.

1410
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:29,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last couple of things I want to introduce tonight, we have a guest with us tonight.

1411
01:42:29,764 --> 01:42:30,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting over there, Paresh EC.

1412
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Paresh, why don't you stand up for a minute?

1413
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:38,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Biresh is the head of the Pioneer Charter School in Everett.

1414
01:42:39,225 --> 01:42:44,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Biresh is spending time with me as he's working to get a superintendent's license.

1415
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on deals to bring kids back.

1416
01:42:49,528 --> 01:43:01,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Biresh is very interesting, and the two of us have very good dialogue, and I look forward to spending good time with Biresh as we talk about the relative merits of education and the like.

1417
01:43:01,332 --> 01:43:14,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate Biresh attending tonight to get a feel for how the school committee works, and I'll certainly spend some time visiting Pioneer to find out some of his top secrets so we can incorporate him in our program.

1418
01:43:14,356 --> 01:43:15,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Biresh, I appreciate it.

1419
01:43:19,713 --> 01:43:22,434
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I mentioned it earlier, but I'll mention it again.

1420
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:31,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight you have two press releases, the beginning of a very series, a very significant series of press releases coming out here tonight.

1421
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:34,717
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is about Ketty Toussignon.

1422
01:43:35,398 --> 01:43:37,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Ketty is the top student in the vocational school.

1423
01:43:38,658 --> 01:43:41,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Ketty is in the health assisting program.

1424
01:43:41,899 --> 01:43:47,361
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now spending nine different sessions at Harvard University in a medical preparation program.

1425
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:51,631
[SPEAKER_00]: She came from Haiti, didn't speak English at all as a 10-year-old.

1426
01:43:52,152 --> 01:44:01,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Today speaks English very, very well, is the top of her class, and someday hopes to become a physician and to open up a hospital in Haiti.

1427
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:02,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful story.

1428
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:03,643
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.

1429
01:44:03,703 --> 01:44:07,827
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our stories about students on the move, students doing things, success stories.

1430
01:44:07,847 --> 01:44:12,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the kind of thing you'll see coming out of our public information office.

1431
01:44:12,912 --> 01:44:20,796
[SPEAKER_00]: The second piece you have is a piece that summarizes the teacher contract to the public to let them know what's been done.

1432
01:44:20,816 --> 01:44:23,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a very good contract.

1433
01:44:23,057 --> 01:44:28,360
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice quote in there from Charlene Douglas, the president of the MTA, affirming the fact that it was good negotiations.

1434
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:38,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the key factors that I want to emphasize is the fact that the teachers embrace the idea of rigorous professional development.

1435
01:44:39,022 --> 01:45:00,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about professional development tonight, the importance of it, all the things that they have to learn in order to be an effective teacher in today's school systems, not just academics, but their ability to work with special students, their ability to understand the laws of the Commonwealth and how it applies to them, and their ability to effectively use technology and other innovative techniques.

1436
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:04,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ability to improve our professional development initiatives

1437
01:45:04,852 --> 01:45:11,177
[SPEAKER_00]: and to put some real money behind it was a great improvement, and I appreciate the committee's support on those matters.

1438
01:45:11,557 --> 01:45:16,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that story will speak well to the public, so happy to put that out there as well.

1439
01:45:17,141 --> 01:45:20,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to some more terrific press releases.

1440
01:45:20,944 --> 01:45:22,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, take note.

1441
01:45:23,285 --> 01:45:25,127
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect to read it in the paper someday.

1442
01:45:25,667 --> 01:45:26,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday.

1443
01:45:26,768 --> 01:45:29,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe tomorrow.

1444
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:29,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1445
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:32,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1446
01:45:32,172 --> 01:45:33,493
[SPEAKER_13]: We revert to executive session.

1447
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:42,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Item nine, negotiations and legal matters, update on personnel discipline action, and an update on negotiation with collective bargaining unions.

1448
01:45:42,952 --> 01:45:47,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We will adjourn it following the executive session as all items have been addressed on the calendar.

1449
01:45:48,713 --> 01:45:52,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will now go into, all those in favor of going into executive session, say aye.

1450
01:45:52,274 --> 01:45:54,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Scherry, please call the roll.

1451
01:45:54,535 --> 01:45:54,795
