[SPEAKER_04]: And I can get you the information.

53

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

54

[SPEAKER_06]: Second item on the agenda, we're taking out of order to a mystic Avenue.

55
00:03:56,906 --> 00:04:05,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, can you read that case to a mystic Avenue case number 40 dash 2024 dash 01 April 20.

00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:23,448
[SPEAKER_04]: The resumption of consideration of the petition of Combined Properties Incorporated for comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40B, the multi-family, eight-story apartment development located in approximately 3.2 acres of land at 278-282 Mystic Avenue.

[SPEAKER_04]: This proposal will be developed as an approximately 378-unit, consisting of a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, with 96 of them being designated as affordable to low- and moderate-income households.

59
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:36,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

60
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:48,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if we're looking for an update on this project from the city to discuss scheduling the next meeting for this case.

61
00:04:56,912 --> 00:05:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have somebody either from the applicant or from the city that can speak to this item?

62
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, second.

63
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dennis.

64
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:17,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Just try to see if the applicant was on.

65
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:20,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see him or the representative on the call.

66
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can give you an update at the end of the last meeting.

67
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:37,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually, you voted to go forward with peer reviewers and we requested.

68
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:45,044
[SPEAKER_04]: That the applicant to provide us with the payment for that, and we have not received payment from that for that.

69
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:51,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

70
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,732
[SPEAKER_06]: With Alicia, thank you.

71
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:01,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I was so focused on other things.

72
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,416
[SPEAKER_22]: I apologize.

73
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,118
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't realize that this would be on this evening.

74
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,340
[SPEAKER_22]: We did get.

75
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:12,598
[SPEAKER_22]: legal advice on this, on the facts.

76
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:19,805
[SPEAKER_22]: So I have talked to the applicant and it wasn't clear what he wanted to do.

77
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,991
[SPEAKER_22]: So we had a very confusing conversation, just to put it clearly like that.

78
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:33,578
[SPEAKER_22]: And he was looking for support from the city before moving forward, before paying for peer review.

79
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:41,205
[SPEAKER_22]: And I tried to explain that we needed the peer review in order to render opinions on the project.

80
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,507
[SPEAKER_22]: So I asked for a legal opinion.

81
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:55,515
[SPEAKER_22]: And the legal opinion was that the board made by majority vote require that the applicant pay a reasonable review fee in accordance with 760 CMR 5605.B.

82
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:16,806
[SPEAKER_22]: for the employment of outside consultants chosen by the board, and that he recommends that the board vote to accept one of the peer review proposals and require that the applicant pay the review fee by a certain date.

83
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:29,050
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm just sort of, because we don't have rules saying that they must do that, you would need to vote to do that.

84
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:37,152
[SPEAKER_22]: The board's rules may provide that if the applicant fails to pay the review fee within the stated period, the board may deny the comprehensive permit.

85
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:52,335
[SPEAKER_22]: By not receiving the money, what has happened for us in the past when we haven't received payments in a timely manner, but the applicant indicated that they were willing to pay the peer review fees,

86
00:07:54,052 --> 00:08:05,760
[SPEAKER_22]: then we've said to them, well, if this means that the meetings are going to drag on longer than they would have been, then we expect that you will agree to extend this hearing on the back end.

87
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,983
[SPEAKER_22]: And they usually, in the past, they've said, if that becomes necessary, we would.

88
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:15,306
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've also let the applicant know that.

89
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:22,111
[SPEAKER_22]: And he verbally said to me, well, if it goes on an extra month or two, you know, on the back end, that's not really going to be an issue for us.

90
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:25,460
[SPEAKER_22]: That is not in writing agreeing to extend the hearing.

91
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:41,385
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can drop the exact language into the chat to one of the members or to the chair or to each of you so that you have it if you were to prefer to do this.

92
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,647
[SPEAKER_22]: But basically, it's voting to accept the peer review proposal.

93
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:53,298
[SPEAKER_22]: and require that the applicant pay by a date certain that you would name tonight.

94
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:56,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you've got your hand up.

95
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a question for Alicia?

96
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

97
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So Alicia, if you could drop that in the chat for me, I am planning to make a motion.

98
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also just raise my hand to say it's disappointing to hear that the applicant has not only

99
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: delayed paying the city to retain peer review consultants, but it also sounds like there hasn't been any progress in providing the additional requested documentation that the peer reviewers and the city staff will be required to review for this project.

100
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:44,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we were discussing this at the last hearing, I was in favor of a longer continuation

101
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:55,525
[SPEAKER_02]: so that the applicant would have time to provide that information because they have not been responsive thus far in my assessment.

102
00:09:57,286 --> 00:10:11,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And so keeping that in mind, I would like to make a motion that the board require the applicant to pay

103
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:25,220
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable review fee in accordance with 760 CMR 56.05B so that the city can retain the employment of outside consultants.

104
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:34,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Furthermore, I motion that the board accept

105
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:38,297
[SPEAKER_02]: the peer review proposals that the city has received.

106
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:47,261
[SPEAKER_02]: This was from Davis Square Architects and Tetra Tech, is that right, Felicia?

107
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

108
00:10:51,203 --> 00:11:02,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I motion that we accept each of those proposals and require the applicant to pay the review fee within five business days of today.

109
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:15,533
[SPEAKER_02]: The review fee should be paid by June 6th.

110
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:32,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, I'd like to motion that the board find that the applicant has not been responsive in paying the review fee or in providing additional information for the board's consideration on this project.

111
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot on the table at once.

112
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, go ahead.

113
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:48,266
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I just want to add that one thing that he expressed was that he had expected a written list of documents that the board wanted to see.

114
00:11:48,907 --> 00:12:00,518
[SPEAKER_22]: And I tried to explain that usually that's produced by the peer review consultant, that what they pay the fee, the peer review consultants then look at the list of what

115
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:08,183
[SPEAKER_22]: been provided, what they need, and they provide us with a written list of documents and information that they need, and we send it to them.

116
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:22,949
[SPEAKER_22]: If the board felt that they could generate a list of what exactly they want or want us to go back to what was requested for a previous applicant and just send them that, that's conceivable.

117
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,991
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just, I felt that in transparency, I should share that that was part of their consternation

118
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,082
[SPEAKER_22]: their confusion around this.

119
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:49,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, if I may, through you, I would be comfortable with suggesting that Director Hunt direct them to the video recording of the first hearing in which I made about a five-minute statement on exactly this and told them exactly

120
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:51,772
[SPEAKER_02]: what I expected.

121
00:12:51,932 --> 00:13:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am sure there will be additional requests by the peer review consultants once the fee is actually paid and they can be retained.

122
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is not a situation where there's ambiguity.

123
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:16,843
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been clear, and the response thus far has not been timely.

124
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made my motion.

125
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:23,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second?

126
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

127
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the board on the motions?

128
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to reiterate, the motion is essentially that we accept the proposals for Davis Square Architects and Tetra Tech

129
00:13:49,993 --> 00:14:00,600
[SPEAKER_02]: require the applicant pay the review fee within five business days, which is June 6th, and find that the applicant's responses thus far have not been timely.

130
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

131
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:06,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do a roll call on that.

132
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:07,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette Velez?

133
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:09,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

134
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:11,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre LaRue?

135
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:12,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

136
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Lee?

137
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

138
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Christy Evano?

139
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Caldera?

140
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:32,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Chris is actually having problems unmuting, so we just have to go for visual cue for those votes.

141
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:33,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

142
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,115

[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie Thompson?

145
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:38,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

146
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to provide a quick update.

147
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:53,382
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that have joined, we did continue 360 Salem Street, the medical use request to the June 27th

148
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,445
[SPEAKER_06]: session of the zoning board, they do have to meet with in front of the community development board before coming to our board.

149
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That community development board meeting will be on June 26th.

150
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:11,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are here for 360 Salem Street, we will we've continued that and we're not going to be reviewing it today.

151
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:19,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jamie, for this case, I'm going to motion we continue it to the

152
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:27,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, July 25th regular meeting of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

153
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:33,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you want to go to July, not June?

154
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we don't even have consultants in hand.

155
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:42,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I see no reason to... Like, we need consultants.

156
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:43,837
[SPEAKER_02]: They need documents.

157
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,118
[SPEAKER_02]: The city, the applicant needs to talk to the city.

158
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already made requests.

159
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:50,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good intent.

160
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:51,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

161
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the intention.

162
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

163
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, do we have a second?

164
00:15:59,464 --> 00:15:59,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

165
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:01,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

166
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, real calm, uh, under the roof.

167
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mary Lee.

168
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I might tell Dara.

169
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:12,412
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

170
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:13,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet the lives.

171
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:17,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Jamie Thompson.

172
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I.

173
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:24,445
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, uh, to 80 mystic ab is continued to the July 25th.

174
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:27,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular meeting of the record zoning board of appeals.

175
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:36,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we will move to 970 fells way and I will give the chair to Mike held our for this case.

176
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:39,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jamie.

177
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Dennis, can you please read this 1?

178
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:51,771
[SPEAKER_04]: 970 Felsway case number 40B-2023-01.

179
00:16:52,371 --> 00:17:04,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Resumption of consideration of petition of DIV Felsway LLC of the Davis Companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40B for multi-family, six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land at 970 Felsway.

180
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:14,999
[SPEAKER_04]: This proposal will be developed as an approximately 289 units pursuant to 278 units of multi-family housing in 11 townhomes, with 73 of them being designated as affordable housing to vote moderate proposals.

181
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:17,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

182
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:26,929
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, folks, so first of all, if you haven't been watching this particular hearing, it started back in November.

183
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,309
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, I was the ZBA chair.

184
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So for continuity's sake, I'm continuing on as acting chair for this matter.

185
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:42,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We've met quite a number of times over that period to discuss all aspects of the project.

186
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, about nine days ago, we met and were actually on the cusp of having a final decision and vote.

187
00:17:53,305 --> 00:18:03,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were just a few items that the applicant and the city agreed it would be productive to just take another week back and forth.

188
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:09,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at this point, we've already reviewed a draft of the decision, including

189
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:25,658
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the site plans and architectural plans and engineering and the peer review letters and draft language for the decision, proposed conditions, proposed waivers, all of this has already been discussed.

190
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:29,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're not, as a board, going to be

191
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, revisiting any of that.

192
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: We're entirely here just to talk about some of the updates that have happened in the past week and potentially to vote on this matter.

193
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:48,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So the board has received an update of the, you know,

194
00:18:49,546 --> 00:19:04,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is a draft, um, decision, um, that was reviewed in the prior public meeting and has also received some additional details from the applicant pertaining, um, to some work items that, um,

195
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:12,720
[SPEAKER_02]: potential offsets against the linkage obligation.

196
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've received these updates offline.

197
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:18,723
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the public record.

198
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:26,446
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to briefly talk about them in the meeting here and then the board may make a decision on this case.

199
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see we have Pat Noon here for the applicant.

200
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I see we have Attorney Tam.

201
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:37,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Attorney Haverty, who's been the city's 40B consultant.

202
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:47,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to quickly check in with Pat Noon just to make sure we've got everything covered, and then we'll be talking with Attorney Haverty and Attorney Tam as needed.

203
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:51,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead, Pat.

204
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we'll have to unmute Pat.

205
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:59,355
[SPEAKER_24]: I think large meeting settings are in effect.

206
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,257
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you're all set.

207
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

208
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:06,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Chair, members of the board, thank you.

209
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again for having us this evening.

210
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:17,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I have nothing to add to the agenda that you just laid out, so we can move forward as you suggested.

211
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:19,943
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, wonderful.

212
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:29,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess maybe it's helpful for us to just start with the subject of linkage, so I'll just

213
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,172
[SPEAKER_02]: state my understanding from having reviewed the documents the board received.

214
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So as part of this project, let me pull up the exact number so that I don't misstate anything.

215
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:55,159
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant is estimating on the order of one point, sorry, not on the order, one point

216
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:57,530
[SPEAKER_02]: There's $1,263,700 worth of total costs in voluntary

217
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: additions to the project that benefit the public, such as road facilities, park facilities, and so on.

218
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:34,201
[SPEAKER_02]: These include things like changes, improvements to roads that are off-site, replacement of an MBTA bus shelter, installation of a blue bike station, a publicly accessible playground and fitness area on the site,

219
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinary, if this was under 40A, the linkage payment obligation is closer to on the order of 800,000.

220
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So the improvements, the voluntary improvements by the applicant's estimates are well in excess of the 800,000.

221
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:59,215
[SPEAKER_02]: linkage payment obligation.

222
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:08,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically under 40A, these types of improvements are considered by the city as potential credits against the linkage obligation.

223
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I understand it, there is a proposal that I know has been discussed with the city.

224
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's differing views on it, but

225
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:34,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant is proposing to make a linkage payment in the amount of $26,693.28 in addition to the payments for the various project costs I just outlined.

226
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: These would be attributed to police and fire.

227
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So under linkage ordinarily,

228
00:22:58,272 --> 00:23:09,538
[SPEAKER_02]: The portion of the payment goes towards water facilities, sewer facilities, road facilities, park facilities, police facilities, and fire facilities.

229
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:17,982
[SPEAKER_02]: This project does not do anything specifically to improve police facilities or fire facilities.

230
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:23,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I understand it, the thought process here is, well, the applicant would

231
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:38,116
[SPEAKER_02]: offer to make this payment, you know, so that that still goes towards the intended use, but then the improvements elsewhere, you know, more than compensate for the amount that would ordinarily be due under linkage.

232
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:40,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my understanding.

233
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to double check.

234
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:48,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll go back to Pat to see if I misunderstood anything there.

235
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:52,908
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to unmute Pat again.

236
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that something you could do, Dennis?

237
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:01,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, there we go.

238
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:02,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

239
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:03,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

240
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

241
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:05,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that is correct.

242
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:22,211
[SPEAKER_16]: After having some productive meetings with members of staff and DPW, the summary that you provided is accurate and we are prepared to make a linkage fee payment in that amount directed towards the police and fire facilities.

243
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:24,172
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

244
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

245
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:31,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I will open it up to questions or comments from the board on this matter.

246
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Mike, this is Andre.

247
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:55,175
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have a question to see if Alicia could speak to this, just so that we have confirmation from the city that we're all set with this.

248
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure, yeah.

249
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Hunt, could you just speak to this?

250
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:04,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the city have a position on the proposal?

251
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:06,614
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly.

252
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:24,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Given that this is a comprehensive permit and it's being handled differently than we would handle linkages and linkage credits through the regular process of the Community Development Board, it seems reasonable to me a lot of the buckets

253
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:32,200
[SPEAKER_22]: The dollars don't line up exactly directly, but they are generally DPW-type things.

254
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:40,904
[SPEAKER_22]: And so this offer to put some of the money that would normally go into the police and fire, because each of these is a trust.

255
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:49,727
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the money that would go into the police and fire trust would still do that, but not plenish the DPW trust.

256
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:53,429
[SPEAKER_22]: But they are doing a bunch of work that would be DPW-type work.

257
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:58,618
[SPEAKER_22]: is a reasonable compromise in this specific situation.

258
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:01,139
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

259
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:02,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

260
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thanks.

261
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,780
[SPEAKER_15]: That's clarifying.

262
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Other questions or comments from the board on this matter?

263
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:43,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a member of the board would like, someone could make a motion to amend the draft decision to include a partial waiver of the linkage payment obligation in the amount of having to do math on the fly.

264
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,569
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's listed here somewhere.

265
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:55,088
[SPEAKER_14]: $26,693.28.

266
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:55,088
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the amount that would still be due.

267
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:58,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So the waiver would be in the amount of the $800,000 minus that.

268
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So the waiver would be $816,564.24.

269
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:05,635
[SPEAKER_02]: That's inclusive of the... So that's already considering the $26,000 or is that the...

270
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:21,413
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the amount of the waiver.

271
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:24,474
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the total was $843,257.52 subtracting the $26,693.28 you left with the waiver being $816,564.24.

272
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:27,456
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's all from the proposed modified condition that the applicant proposed.

273
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:53,914
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion to amend the draft decision for a partial waiver of the linkage payment in the amount of $816,564.24.

274
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

275
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:56,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

276
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:00,700
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

277
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:15,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because of the Mullen rule, we're going to focus the votes on the four members who've been at either all or all but one of the

278
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:17,681
[SPEAKER_24]: the hearings.

279
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yvette Velez?

280
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:24,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

281
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:26,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre LaRue?

282
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:27,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

283
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie Thompson?

284
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

285
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Caldera?

286
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:32,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

287
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:33,427
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

288
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think linkage is now settled.

289
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we need to discuss it,

290
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,351
[SPEAKER_02]: at or Attorney Tam can raise their hand.

291
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, I'll go next to Attorney Haverty.

292
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:54,038
[SPEAKER_02]: The board has received the updated draft decision.

293
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:55,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a chance to review it.

294
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all had a chance to review it.

295
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:03,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you maybe just give a high-level summary of

296
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:14,805
[SPEAKER_02]: the current state and if there are any open items or kind of notable changes between the draft we reviewed last week and now.

297
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

298
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:27,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I did was I submitted a tracked change version and then a separate tracked change version with most changes accepted, but with really the highlights left in.

299
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what I would propose to go over is that version.

300
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:39,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first outstanding issue that I need resolved is on page 10 in condition 8.8.

301
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:44,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis, can we bring that one up?

302
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The changes mostly accepted version.

303
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

304
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:58,081
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a couple of outstanding issues with regard to this condition.

305
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's also some additional language.

306
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:07,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first question that needs to be addressed is the applicant has proposed reducing the amount of time

307
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:17,248
[SPEAKER_14]: for responses to the submittal of final plans to 30 days, rather than the 45 days that was in the original draft condition.

308
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:23,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have also proposed capping peer review fees to a total amount of $25,000.

309
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:29,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know the building commissioner has expressed some concerns with both of these.

310
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:36,242
[SPEAKER_14]: And the building commissioner also expressed some concerns with regards to just sort of the timing in general.

311
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I did add language at the end of this.

312
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:51,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to clarify that a response indicating that additional time is required for review of plans shall be sufficient to prevent constructive approval of final plans.

313
00:30:51,875 --> 00:31:00,219
[SPEAKER_14]: No condition within this decision shall be interpreted to encroach upon or otherwise constrain the authority of the building commissioner acting under the state building code.

314
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:07,642
[SPEAKER_14]: The conditions contained herein pertain solely to the administration of this comprehensive permit and that was to address concerns.

315
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:37,550
[SPEAKER_14]: that were raised by the building commissioner that he thought that some of these conditions may have been infringing upon his exclusive jurisdiction under the state building code, which you cannot do under chapter 40 B. So I just wanted to make sure that I was clarifying that, but ultimately what I need from the board is to get a sense as to whether they think the 30 day time period is sufficient or whether they want the 45 days and what their thoughts are on the cap of the peer review fees.

316
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:42,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis, could you navigate down to that one?

317
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:47,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the first thing you'll see in red in this copy.

318
00:31:48,752 --> 00:32:05,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my point of uncertainty and concern with 30 days is that there are some administrative steps we have to do to schedule meetings and

319
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: as a zoning board, and so we typically meet every 30 days today.

320
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:33,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's 30-day period and it comes just in an unfortunate timing, presumably not intentional, just like a bad timing situation,

321
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:47,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It may very well be the case that the board must hear this at a hearing that for whatever reason is not conducive for this review.

322
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think 45 days should give the board a little bit more options just for eating scheduling and so on.

323
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,012
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the cap on the,

324
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Peer review fees, I presume that would be for peer review of changes, not the peer review fees incurred during this hearing.

325
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:15,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see Mr. Tam has his hand raised.

326
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.

327
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:21,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

328
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Just as a point of clarification,

329
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:42,339
[SPEAKER_13]: would not necessarily disagree with the Building Commissioner's concern, but I point to other 40B decisions which this board has granted, including most recently at 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway, 30 days was provided there.

330
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I think with the language that Attorney Haverty has included,

331
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,731
[SPEAKER_13]: there is ample protection.

332
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:54,212
[SPEAKER_13]: It just requires a response.

333
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,434
[SPEAKER_13]: The response can basically say, we need more time.

334
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:15,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is this policy preference that's contemplated in 40B for a deliberate, timely process.

335
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,323
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just want to be

336
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:20,582
[SPEAKER_13]: considered like any other applicant.

337
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:34,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think where that precedent has been established by the board, we're OK with the additional language, which provides, I think, the building commissioner adequate flexibility.

338
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:42,191
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we would appreciate to be treated like other applicants and simply expect a response.

339
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:46,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And the language here says reasonably, right?

340
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:51,688
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll use reasonable efforts to review and provide a written response.

341
00:34:57,354 --> 00:34:57,695
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

342
00:34:58,636 --> 00:34:58,936
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

343
00:34:59,457 --> 00:34:59,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

344
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:04,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check in with the building commissioner.

345
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:05,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott, do you?

346
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,145
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your current thoughts now that this language has been added?

347
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the 30 days are less concerning?

348
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what are your thoughts on the cap for the period use?

349
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:22,513
[SPEAKER_11]: First thing I should point out is this is the building permit approval process.

350
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It will not come back to the board in any way.

351
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:37,761
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what is defined by 780 CMR, Mass General Chapter 143, and it states in the building code, I shall have 30 days to respond, not necessarily to approve, but to respond.

352
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:42,847
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is consistent with what the state building code calls for.

353
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:47,072
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not uncommon for these things to take longer than 30 days.

354
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:52,660
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not uncommon for applicants to not submit everything they need within the required time.

355
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,981
[SPEAKER_11]: So it also takes long.

356
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:55,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, if I go out for peer review,

357
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:03,351
[SPEAKER_11]: of the documents from a construction and code perspective, which is what the money is set aside for that could take me longer than 30 days.

358
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:06,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So they would get a response saying we need more time.

359
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:07,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's why.

360
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:13,521
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no element of constructive approval through the building code that cannot happen.

361
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:14,502
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not happen.

362
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:20,588
[SPEAKER_11]: So I anticipate getting a set of documents and beginning to review with a peer reviewer.

363
00:36:21,288 --> 00:36:29,854
[SPEAKER_11]: for probably firing code to some of those and responding in 30 days that perhaps we need more time, which is a pretty common process we do with everybody.

364
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:34,518
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't treat them differently, but this does align it with the language of the state building code more accurately.

365
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and do you think the, so I understand the thought process and having a cap on the fees just so that it's a little bit more tangible for the applicant is, what are your thoughts on the 25,000 cap?

366
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that appropriate?

367
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that too low, too high?

368
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:02,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not have a good handle on what the actual costs may be.

369
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:14,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll certainly triage it in the sense we'll focus on fire code and egress type of issues first before we get into more aesthetic and less, you know, less safety oriented issues.

370
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't have a budget in mind at this time.

371
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:22,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not reached out to anybody yet to determine what a budget might be to do this.

372
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:50,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hypothetically, if the board were to impose a cap and then you were to determine that review by an outside consultant was required and the consultant fees were in excess of that cap, am I correct in my understanding that the city would basically have to choose between not having a consultant or paying the difference?

373
00:37:53,063 --> 00:38:04,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the complication within the building code in chapter one, it makes it very clear that I have the authority under the state building code to hire whomever I need to do whatever review I need at the expense of the applicant.

374
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:16,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So theoretically, this is a zoning condition, which I'm not gonna say it's not gonna hold me back if I need to do what I need to do, but under the state building code, I will follow the building code as written.

375
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:22,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I need to spend more than $25,000 as justified under the code, I will do so.

376
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:33,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chairman, if I can clarify, this condition does not address the review by the building commissioner of the building permit application.

377
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,681
[SPEAKER_14]: That is wholly contained within the state building code and is outside any jurisdiction of this board.

378
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:46,223
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot impose conditions that limit his review in any way, shape or form as part of that process.

379
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:52,445
[SPEAKER_14]: This is only addressing the review of final plans for consistency with this decision.

380
00:38:54,477 --> 00:39:11,572
[SPEAKER_14]: So keeping this condition as currently drafted would not prevent the building commissioner from exceeding $25,000 in total peer review costs if he determines that the review under the state building code required some higher level of peer review.

381
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:13,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

382
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

383
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:19,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the board, my thought just to

384
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:26,247
[SPEAKER_02]: While following Robert's rules, engage in a somewhat fluid way here.

385
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask members of the board if we're reviewing a condition and you would like to propose a modification or

386
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:44,344
[SPEAKER_02]: share an opinion, you know, for our consideration, please raise your hand and do so as we go.

387
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:55,090
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't hear anyone speaking up and city staff or Attorney Haverty indicates that, you know, the change is fine, we're just going to move on.

388
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, you know, we can make a

389
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:04,460
[SPEAKER_02]: motion to reflect all of the changes in totality rather than doing them one by one.

390
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't intend to vote one by one.

391
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:15,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you're a member of the board and you would like to propose any modifications here or share any comments, please go ahead.

392
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we'll move on to the next item.

393
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

394
00:40:25,602 --> 00:40:30,265
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Mr. Chair, before we move on from this, are we going to go with the 30 days or the 45 days?

395
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to reserve the right for any member of the board to later make a motion and come back to things.

396
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:47,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But currently, we're moving on with the condition as written, the 30 days, the added language, the 25K cap.

397
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:48,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

398
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:49,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

399
00:40:54,532 --> 00:41:09,775
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so the next condition that I have flagged, let's see.

400
00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:20,198
[SPEAKER_14]: C1, there's a provision that states, it was suggested by the applicant, any separate fee due at building permit issuance.

401
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:30,188
[SPEAKER_14]: shall be reduced by any amounts paid by the applicant for technical reviews and inspections by outside experts hired by the building commissioner or the board here under.

402
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:38,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I presume that the building commissioner is going to have some thoughts on this proposal.

403
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:41,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Commissioner, do you have thoughts on this proposal?

404
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:51,129
[SPEAKER_11]: under the building code is written, I would not accept that unless you determined you're willing to accept that.

405
00:41:51,149 --> 00:41:53,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, technically, fees are set by the community.

406
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:55,271
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a set fee for that.

407
00:41:55,752 --> 00:42:01,555
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to pay for any outside consultants or inspectors in accordance with the code as required.

408
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:02,896
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to pay for that.

409
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:09,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna weigh in on whether somebody's willing to waive the fees.

410
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:13,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that has to be considered by a little bit higher authority than me.

411
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

412
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'd love to hear members of the board's thoughts on this.

413
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:42,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like this condition would offset some of the review costs incurred through reduction in the permit cost.

414
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Would any member of the board like to weigh in on that one?

415
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:53,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to clarify.

416
00:42:53,815 --> 00:43:01,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is additional fees during the continuing stages going to building and things like that?

417
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:02,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

418
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:06,404
[SPEAKER_14]: It would not be a reduction on the peer review fees paid to date.

419
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:10,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Only the peer review fees for reviewing final plans.

420
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:17,380
[SPEAKER_11]: and any inspections, outside inspections required under the code as well, I think the statement was.

421
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:37,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're preempting the cost of what would be required fees for the

422
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:42,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Continued the continued development and construction in the building.

423
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so I think the building commissioners point here as well taken.

424
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:52,694
[SPEAKER_14]: The previous sentence, the use of outside experts for such technical reviews and inspections.

425
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:59,306
[SPEAKER_14]: must be reserved for instances where no city personnel or department has the necessary expertise to perform the same.

426
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:06,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And in these cases, fees for outside expert reviews will be charged to the applicant only if compliance with municipal ordinance or regulations.

427
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:16,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what inspections would be done as part of the review of the final plans.

428
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,122
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would suggest removing the end inspections.

429
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:29,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And there will be inspections done by an outside consultant potentially not anticipated during the course of construction at this time as well.

430
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:34,416
[SPEAKER_11]: But that would be under your review under the building code, correct?

431
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:39,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, just as long as it's clear that somewhere in there that all gets picked up.

432
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:43,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But as for waiving the fees, since they're not even included within the zoning ordinance, that's a tough one.

433
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:48,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel I have the authority to waive fees or even suggest waiving fees.

434
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I don't agree with this one.

435
00:44:58,955 --> 00:45:08,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't really heard a case for why this is appropriate or necessary.

436
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:13,245
[SPEAKER_02]: These fees are pretty standard.

437
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:19,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really understand why

438
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:26,090
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the 4DB process, the guidance we're getting is don't treat.

439
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:31,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't impose conditions that would be different.

440
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,032
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from what we would impose on, from, from what's expected of anything else.

441
00:45:36,112 --> 00:45:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that kind of applies here, unless there's something I'm misunderstanding where, you know, this project is especially sensitive to these fees or already uneconomical.

442
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see a reason to grant such a allowance.

443
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Attorney Tam would like to speak to this.

444
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:01,443
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry, I missed it.

445
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:04,183
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Attorney Tam, please go ahead.

446
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:05,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

447
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:11,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Just for the sake, I know you have a busy agenda.

448
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:16,906
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we will... We're in support of removing the last sentence.

449
00:46:20,587 --> 00:46:26,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and the last sentence is the sentence that... That essentially...

450
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

451
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:41,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, a municipal fee cannot be used to create revenue.

452
00:46:42,285 --> 00:46:45,909
[SPEAKER_13]: It is to compensate the municipality for the cost incurred.

453
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:49,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that was the intent here, was essentially to say if there was

454
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:54,310
[SPEAKER_13]: a cost associated with an inspection that had come out of the fee.

455
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,092
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think in the interest of time, we can remove this last sentence that says that.

456
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:01,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wonderful.

457
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:16,577
[SPEAKER_13]: I would remind the board that we're not seeking, aside from the credit for the linkage, which we appreciate having resolved with the board, we're not seeking any relief from building permit fees.

458
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:18,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Understood.

459
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:19,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

460
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:24,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think let's let's just remove that last sentence.

461
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's we would have needed a discussion earlier about the likely costs the city is going to incur.

462
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding is these fees are set at the appropriate level to not be revenue generating.

463
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:45,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll strike that sentence unless a member of the board would like to motion otherwise.

464
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:52,196
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's next, Attorney Haverty?

465
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:58,783
[SPEAKER_14]: So moving on, I've got a marginal notation under subsection C, but that was addressed by our discussion above.

466
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:01,386
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 days remain the time.

467
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:02,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

468
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:10,596
[SPEAKER_14]: And moving on to subsection E.

469
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:25,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I just added language at the end of subsection E, if the building commissioner informs the applicant of any deficiencies in the final plan as submitted, the 30 day period shall not run until compliant plans are submitted.

470
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:30,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, that helps address the concerns with regards to a potential constructive approval.

471
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:36,974
[SPEAKER_14]: All it requires is notification, you know, that the plans were incomplete and the 30 day period will not run.

472
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:38,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, looks good.

473
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:39,996
[SPEAKER_14]: What's next?

474
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:54,435
[SPEAKER_14]: In C2 subsection E, at the building commissioner's suggestion, I added language as adopted by the state building code.

475
00:48:55,096 --> 00:49:03,242
[SPEAKER_14]: As he pointed out, the NFPA 13 and NFPA 72 requirements are incorporated within the building code.

476
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,044
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just added that language.

477
00:49:05,864 --> 00:49:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

478
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:07,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty straightforward.

479
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:07,946
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds good.

480
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:17,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Next is on D3 on page 19.

481
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:30,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to have changed the identification of who would be reviewing certain materials submitted by the applicants.

482
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:35,278
[SPEAKER_14]: So subsection E would be the city engineer rather than the building commissioner.

483
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Subsection H, the appropriate division of the Department of Public Works.

484
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:47,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I obtained confirmation from the superintendent of the water and sewer division and same for Jay.

485
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:51,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's pretty straightforward.

486
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:52,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

487
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:55,245
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was all based upon comments from town staff.

488
00:49:58,886 --> 00:49:59,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, city staff.

489
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:10,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sorry, I'm going a little slowly, but I'm trying to make these changes as we go, so I can get you a final decision.

490
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,471
[SPEAKER_14]: quickly as possible.

491
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:16,975
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

492
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:35,111
[SPEAKER_14]: My next marginal notation is at the end of page 26.

493
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:45,574
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was a question that was asked by city staff.

494
00:50:46,214 --> 00:50:50,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the applicant proposing to provide funding towards operation of the blue bikes?

495
00:50:51,637 --> 00:51:03,002
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is on condition F8G, which was proposed by the board's traffic peer review consultants.

496
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:10,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It talks about blue bike stations, and the question is whether or not the applicant will be funding any of the operations.

497
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to add to that, so my uncertainty with a literal reading of this is that, so in the list of improvements,

498
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: that we considered in terms of the partial waiver for linkage.

499
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:37,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It states that the blue bike station is one of those costs.

500
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:43,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And I at least have the understanding that the installation of this station is included in that cost.

501
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,465
[SPEAKER_02]: This current wording

502
00:51:47,114 --> 00:52:01,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in one of the emails from city staff, there was some uncertainty about whether it's just making space available or if it's actually, if deemed feasible by the city, the installation of this station.

503
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:10,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that question and then there's a separate question also from city staff about some of the ongoing cost to operate the station.

504
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there someone for the applicant who could speak to that?

505
00:52:19,913 --> 00:52:20,914
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Pat, you?

506
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:26,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

507
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:31,841
[SPEAKER_16]: So two-part question to answer the first part.

508
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:45,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it is our intention, if deemed feasible and desirable by the city, space would be made available, and we are proposing to pay for and install the Blue Bike Station.

509
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:54,135
[SPEAKER_16]: As a part of the project, and that that is represented in the cost summary that was previously reviewed as a project benefit.

510
00:52:56,276 --> 00:53:02,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Part 2 of the question in conversations with DPW over the course of the last week, the.

511
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:16,768
[SPEAKER_16]: operating costs of the station were discussed, and a period of two years was proposed for us to pay for the operating of the Blue Bike Station at that time.

512
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:19,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wonderful.

513
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:19,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

514
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:25,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So then in that case, Attorney Haverty, I think we'll have to slightly modify this language.

515
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:28,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure the best way to word it, but it would be something like

516
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:37,583
[SPEAKER_02]: If deemed feasible and desirable by the city, space shall be made within or in close proximity of the project site for such blue bike station.

517
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:44,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And a blue bike station shall be installed at the applicant's expense.

518
00:53:46,067 --> 00:53:55,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And the applicant shall pay the operational cost of that station for the first two years, something along those lines.

519
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:56,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it.

520
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:57,752
Cool.

521
00:53:58,492 --> 00:53:58,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

522
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was a similar question.

523
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I don't know what subsection it was, but for the condition on the bus shelter, it was a little vague about whether it would just be the removal or the installation of the new one.

524
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the project costs, that includes the installation of the new bus shelter.

525
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:26,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

526
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,408
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is addressed.

527
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,702
[SPEAKER_14]: That's already wonderful.

528
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:32,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

529
00:54:32,122 --> 00:54:34,025
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's go to.

530
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:37,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So F9.

531
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,152
[SPEAKER_14]: F9.

532
00:54:41,293 --> 00:54:50,144
[SPEAKER_14]: The preface to the four subconditions states the applicant shall design, construct, and implement the following improvements.

533
00:54:51,830 --> 00:55:09,363
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was one of the concerns that doesn't address the shelter, but it does address concern raised by Todd Blake to make it clear that the applicant is committing to constructing and implementing these changes.

534
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:12,945
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to point that out.

535
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

536
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:25,703
[SPEAKER_14]: being for F11 addresses the bus shelter.

537
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:47,142
[SPEAKER_14]: So it states now the applicant shall coordinate with the MBTA to subject to MBTA approval and all applicable legal requirements, remove the existing bus shelter at the intersection of Felsway and Myrtle Street, and to install a new shelter equipped with appropriate amenities just south of the proposed Felsway driveway.

538
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:55,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's clear that it is the installation of a new bus shelter, not a rehabilitation of the existing one.

539
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:57,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

540
00:55:58,729 --> 00:55:59,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

541
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:09,556
[SPEAKER_14]: On F10, we were informed that the Central Avenue and Spring Street traffic signal

542
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:20,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, has already gone through a process with the city, and it's not something that needs to be done as part of this development.

543
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:33,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So the proposal was to instead add language, including providing recommendations and cost estimates for providing a speed hump on Kenmare and Pinkert streets and or Lawrence and Myrtle streets.

544
00:56:34,955 --> 00:56:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

545
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:37,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I understand this one is a

546
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:42,873
[SPEAKER_02]: proposal that was not previously been discussed.

547
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:43,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

548
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:44,874
[SPEAKER_02]: In this hearing.

549
00:56:44,974 --> 00:56:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do want to check in with Pat on that one.

550
00:56:49,316 --> 00:57:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, as I understand it, the prior, um, the prior improvement overlaps with something the city is already in the process of making.

551
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:05,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was, um,

552
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:11,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Blake's proposed alternative.

553
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:16,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Director Hunt.

554
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:23,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to be clear that this was not Director Blake's proposed alternative.

555
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:26,100
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the applicant's proposed alternative.

556
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I misunderstood that.

557
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the email all wrong.

558
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the applicant's proposed alternative.

559
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:32,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

560
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:37,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're aligned, then I think that's pretty clear.

561
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:40,873
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel that I should say it, but you do what you want.

562
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:52,237
[SPEAKER_22]: The director, Blake, has indicated that it is much more beneficial to the city if the applicants can spend the same amount of money on construction than on studies.

563
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,858
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a huge difference for the city because

564
00:57:55,244 --> 00:58:01,546
[SPEAKER_22]: construction for the city is so much more expensive and cumbersome when done with public funds.

565
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:06,347
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's not something to delay the whole project over.

566
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

567
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:15,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So as currently worded, this would be the study alone.

568
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:22,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would culminate in recommendations and cost estimates, and there would be a cost in conducting the study.

569
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:27,438
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not actually doing the improvement.

570
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,280
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

571
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts from the public on that?

572
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:37,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I reading F9?

573
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:38,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's F9, correctly.

574
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:41,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall design, construct, and implement the following improvements, correct?

575
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:42,663
[SPEAKER_02]: F10.

576
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:44,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I apologize.

577
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:50,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so F9, these are all improvements that

578
00:58:55,218 --> 00:59:00,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be in coordinated with DCR, but these will actually be implemented.

579
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:09,541
[SPEAKER_02]: The F10 is just a study.

580
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree it's not something to delay over.

581
00:59:12,822 --> 00:59:19,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I had reservations introducing something net new this late in the process.

582
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think while I agree that

583
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:24,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Constructing it would be better.

584
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:32,777
[SPEAKER_02]: At least we'll have an understanding of the cost and the recommendations, which is better than what we had.

585
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is a reasonable compromise.

586
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:44,799
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, what's next?

587
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:52,100
[SPEAKER_14]: 12, language changed to note design and construct rather than implement the curb extensions.

588
00:59:53,018 --> 01:00:01,364
[SPEAKER_14]: on Myrtle Street, Amaranth Avenue, and Lawrence Street, and then additional language designed to be approved by the City of Medford Engineering Office prior to construction.

589
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:06,168
[SPEAKER_14]: The applicant shall revise such design as necessary until approval is reached.

590
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Such approval should not be unnecessarily withheld.

591
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:10,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

592
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, unreasonably withheld.

593
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,455
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

594
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:32,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all I have in the conditions?

595
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:37,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Attorney Tam.

596
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:42,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

597
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:45,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to interrupt Attorney Haverty's flow.

598
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:56,272
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a minor suggestion that we shared with Attorney Haverty just prior to this meeting, and that is to E12.

599
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:56,492
[SPEAKER_13]: E12, OK.

600
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:00,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can read it to you.

601
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's common sense, but I'll explain the rationale.

602
01:01:05,022 --> 01:01:09,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, it doesn't change the substance of the condition.

603
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:27,595
[SPEAKER_13]: So this condition requires that any, it's the last sentence, any unsuitable material, if any, discovered in excavation of the infiltration system, this is for stormwater, be removed and disposed of in accordance with state and local regulations.

604
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:33,286
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no concern with that other than by unsuitable material.

605
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:43,252
[SPEAKER_13]: These might be not necessarily contaminated materials, but just materials that are unsuitable in the location of a stormwater management infiltration basin.

606
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:54,019
[SPEAKER_13]: So we suggested this language and that these soils could be managed and handled on site in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

607
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,102
[SPEAKER_13]: So we just suggest adding language that says that

608
01:01:59,311 --> 01:02:09,496
[SPEAKER_13]: These materials, if discovered in excavation for the infiltration system, shall be handled, managed, and, if necessary, removed and disposed of.

609
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

610
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:14,739
[SPEAKER_02]: No concerns with that proposed change.

611
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:15,880
[SPEAKER_02]: No concerns?

612
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,240
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

613
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:22,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So would a member of the board like to speak on this one?

614
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:24,344
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we can make that change.

615
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:26,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with that as well.

616
01:02:28,424 --> 01:02:28,924
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, great.

617
01:02:29,184 --> 01:02:29,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Attorney Tam.

618
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:30,745
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

619
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:40,070
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so going to the waivers, the first change I have is on number 24.

620
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,151
[SPEAKER_24]: We have Jamie.

621
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.

622
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:44,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

623
01:02:44,813 --> 01:02:47,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go back to AA on my notes.

624
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:48,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we?

625
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:48,375
[SPEAKER_06]: AA.

626
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: AA, the $25,000.

627
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:51,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So presently, we've

628
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:01,328
[SPEAKER_02]: proposed no changes to that language.

629
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:08,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, in fact, capped at $25,000, but any member of the board could propose a change.

630
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I guess my question is this.

631
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: What is in a... I guess my question is, in a standard process, is there an expectation that this would normally exceed that amount?

632
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:27,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm just in that state of where... Yeah, so as I understand... ...unknown expense for the city.

633
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so as I understood it, this is the cap on the fees to review the final plans themselves.

634
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:45,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a consultant were required to review the final plans, that amount would be capped at $25,000.

635
01:03:45,548 --> 01:03:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So other reviews under the building code are not subject to this.

636
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:55,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And the impression I got from the building commissioner is that we don't really

637
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:09,906
[SPEAKER_02]: John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): A great understanding of exactly what the the top end of the cost would be here, but yeah for me, I think, maybe, since this is review of the final plan that's not going to be a big ticket item, I see.

638
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:10,947
[SPEAKER_02]: John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His.:

639
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,108
[SPEAKER_02]: : Yeah, so they can make sure John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His.:

640
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:19,911
[SPEAKER_06]: : My notes between this one, and the other item I got confused on what we're looking at from fees and things like that, I just want to make sure I had this one correct okay i'm good.

641
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:23,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner, go ahead.

642
01:04:23,144 --> 01:04:41,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so correct me if I'm wrong, that I'm presuming from this conversation that this particular review has more to do with rehiring your current peer reviewers to review it for conformance to the plan, which may be more Director Hunt's area of expertise than a building code review, which this is not about.

643
01:04:44,425 --> 01:04:51,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it doesn't specifically require that you retain the same consultants, but I think it's in that vein.

644
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so.

645
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It's correct.

646
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:57,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt, is that something you want to speak to?

647
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the magnitude here something concerning to you, capped at 25,000?

648
01:05:03,436 --> 01:05:11,020
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just say we've never hired peer reviewers for this before.

649
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:16,118
[SPEAKER_22]: because it's never come up like in this type of situation.

650
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,005
[SPEAKER_22]: Typical city projects, the city engineer reviews and then reviews the plans, et cetera.

651
01:05:24,313 --> 01:05:31,254
[SPEAKER_22]: because we haven't had a project of this magnitude that underwent peer review actually then go to construction.

652
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:33,915
[SPEAKER_22]: We haven't actually done it.

653
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:45,937
[SPEAKER_22]: In my mind, if we were going to hire a peer reviewer to ensure that things were being done to the plan, we would go back to the same peer reviewer because then you wouldn't have to pay for all the startups.

654
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:52,278
[SPEAKER_22]: But how much that would cost, I honestly have no way to say because we have no experience with it.

655
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:08,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we were to do some back-of-the-envelope math from the bids over the course of this hearing for the support received, is that, I mean, were we a right order of magnitude?

656
01:06:09,163 --> 01:06:16,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, Dennis, can you, the original, the amount that we've had for peer review costs for this project is on the order of $50,000.

657
01:06:16,824 --> 01:06:19,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

658
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:21,885
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, there are two different ones.

659
01:06:24,575 --> 01:06:28,437
[SPEAKER_22]: the site civil stuff and the other was the architectural.

660
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:30,758
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we're really concerned about the architectural.

661
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,500
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this is all about the site civil type stuff.

662
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

663
01:06:42,263 --> 01:06:42,984
[SPEAKER_22]: I think he's looking.

664
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:48,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Dennis requests the money, receives the money, deposits the money, and signs up.

665
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:53,424
[SPEAKER_24]: I see Andre has his hand raised.

666
01:06:53,684 --> 01:07:02,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Andre, please go ahead.

667
01:07:02,896 --> 01:07:04,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Andre needs help unmuting.

668
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:13,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thanks.

669
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:17,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I switched my phone to my laptop so that I wasn't able to unmute myself.

670
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:21,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just wanted to say that this language seems fine to me.

671
01:07:21,494 --> 01:07:23,156
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's a point we should belabor.

672
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:27,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's an appropriate amount and probably not something that will even be necessary.

673
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,170
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

674
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott, your hand's still up.

675
01:07:32,712 --> 01:07:33,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that?

676
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have one more comment.

677
01:07:34,933 --> 01:07:44,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this would probably be used to address, as you mentioned before, more of the site engineering element in some fashion, because the building code covers the structure.

678
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:48,481
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not cover that which overlaps with the engineering department.

679
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:56,185
[SPEAKER_11]: So this may almost be whether or not they want to hire an outside consultant to review the work or some capacity like that.

680
01:07:57,105 --> 01:08:02,469
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right, architectural and building code is just the building, it's not the other elements.

681
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

682
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:12,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to agree with Andre on this, so unless a member has some concerns they'd like to continue discussing, I think we can move on to the waivers.

683
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:13,797
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.

684
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:14,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, I appreciate it.

685
01:08:16,499 --> 01:08:17,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it's the waiver, right?

686
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:17,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

687
01:08:18,901 --> 01:08:19,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

688
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:27,856
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first waiver that I've got flagged here is number 24.

689
01:08:31,437 --> 01:08:35,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is proposed by the applicant and it addresses the linkage fees.

690
01:08:35,398 --> 01:08:40,859
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe Peter can explain what exactly they're looking for here.

691
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this one, wasn't this one with Ron?

692
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:52,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I misunderstand?

693
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:05,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 25 was withdrawn.

694
01:09:05,585 --> 01:09:07,346
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 was what?

695
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, I misunderstood.

696
01:09:11,887 --> 01:09:17,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we've already granted a partial waiver, so I think that was the what Jamie motion.

697
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll just make that modification so well, right?

698
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:27,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So no concerns with any of the changes proposed by the applicant here.

699
01:09:28,091 --> 01:09:31,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so the I think the language will have to change so it.

700
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:38,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the actual language on the waiver of the linkage fee is in 26.

701
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:38,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's in 26?

702
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:39,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

703
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Tam, did you have something to add?

704
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:49,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Attorney Tam, is there something you wanted to say?

705
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:52,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

706
01:09:53,112 --> 01:10:01,615
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're right in that 24 and 26 can essentially be, I think they can be merged.

707
01:10:03,187 --> 01:10:06,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the board has already taken action on the partial waiver here.

708
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:20,115
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, I haven't I haven't looked at them together, but I. I think they address the same issue, which is linkage, and.

709
01:10:21,235 --> 01:10:24,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the board has already acted on this in granting a partial waiver.

710
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:28,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

711
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I share that understanding.

712
01:10:30,535 --> 01:10:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the board's intention is to partially waive the fee.

713
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would be waiving any procedural requirements that would require them to go before the development forwarder.

714
01:10:49,985 --> 01:10:50,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

715
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:53,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So is this waiver request then just withdrawn?

716
01:10:57,569 --> 01:10:59,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can put the but you know, but see waiver request 26.

717
01:11:00,252 --> 01:11:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my understanding.

718
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:16,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll add the language for the partial waiver and that will be that will subsume these other ones.

719
01:11:16,587 --> 01:11:19,069
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can remove them.

720
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:43,442
[SPEAKER_14]: And then 25, I just put waiver request withdrawn just so that we are able to keep track of the fact that it was a waiver previously requested and it was not acted upon by the board at the request of the applicant.

721
01:11:45,904 --> 01:11:48,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Then number 26 sets forth all of the

722
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:56,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Discussion regarding the linkage payments, which I think the board has already addressed.

723
01:12:03,996 --> 01:12:05,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I have.

724
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:07,257
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, wonderful.

725
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So then there's a few housekeeping items.

726
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure.

727
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:18,022
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a shared understanding about before we go on to next step.

728
01:12:18,062 --> 01:12:18,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

729
01:12:21,145 --> 01:12:31,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a draft decision that we just went through and amended that will form the basis of the final decision.

730
01:12:31,349 --> 01:12:33,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the board

731
01:12:35,658 --> 01:12:46,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, once the board votes tonight, if it's in accordance with this decision, will we need to do anything else in a separate public hearing?

732
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we need to provide any special authorizations to the chair or anything like that?

733
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:58,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we just make a motion with respect to this draft order and take a vote and that's it?

734
01:13:00,285 --> 01:13:01,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you can just

735
01:13:03,737 --> 01:13:11,960
[SPEAKER_14]: take a motion to vote on the decision as discussed and as changed over the course of the discussion tonight.

736
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:20,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it typically your process for just the chair to sign a decision or do all the board members sign?

737
01:13:20,703 --> 01:13:32,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So customarily, we will make a decision, we'll vote, we'll discuss any conditions if appropriate, then

738
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:40,895
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be a draft decision which is circulated for signatures and everyone signs it.

739
01:13:40,915 --> 01:13:54,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The 40B we heard last year, I think mostly for reasons of timeline, we actually had a meeting within 40 days of the closure

740
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: to review the decision and then in that case authorize the chair.

741
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:11,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So but normally we would have everyone sign and I'd be inclined to do this here unless there's some you know procedural reason to just delegate that to a to the chair.

742
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:16,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay so so what your option to do tonight is to just close the public hearing

743
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:38,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I can send you all of the changes that were discussed, send you a clean version that you can schedule a deliberation session at which you can vote to accept the decision as drafted and then sign when you're available to sign.

744
01:14:39,694 --> 01:14:43,357
[SPEAKER_14]: You have 40 days from the close of the public hearing to deliberate.

745
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:57,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's up to you whether or not you want to simply close the hearing and vote tonight, or whether or not you want to close the hearing and take a look at the final draft and then vote on that at a deliberation session.

746
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:05,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Once you take your vote on the decision, you then have 14 days to submit the written decision to the city clerk.

747
01:15:07,551 --> 01:15:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, got it.

748
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:12,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So that answered my procedural question.

749
01:15:14,187 --> 01:15:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Other procedural questions from the board?

750
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, then in that case, I just want to check in with the applicant.

751
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:31,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything we should still discuss before a member of the board makes a motion here?

752
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:38,047
[SPEAKER_24]: Attorney Tam?

753
01:15:45,565 --> 01:15:49,247
[SPEAKER_24]: Attorney Tam, please go ahead.

754
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:51,989
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to unmute you, huh?

755
01:15:52,989 --> 01:15:54,150
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, sorry.

756
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:58,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

757
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing on behalf of the applicant.

758
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:06,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're, I think, in consensus that the decision is very thorough.

759
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:18,826
[SPEAKER_13]: that the process has been very productive and we've appreciated the time that the board has spent by members of the public as well as all the staff that have been involved in multiple reviews.

760
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:25,229
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really up to the board at this stage.

761
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wonderful.

762
01:16:32,012 --> 01:16:36,854
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, chair awaits a motion on this matter.

763
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:50,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve the decision on 970 Felsway as written subject to conditions and granting the waivers as written.

764
01:16:52,384 --> 01:16:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second?

765
01:16:55,086 --> 01:16:55,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded.

766
01:16:55,446 --> 01:17:00,990
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're going to take a roll call and again it will be the four members that

767
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:09,989
[SPEAKER_02]: have either been at all the sessions of this hearing or missed one but reviewed it and signed a mullet affidavit.

768
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:13,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yvette Velez?

769
01:17:14,953 --> 01:17:15,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

770
01:17:16,314 --> 01:17:16,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre LaRue?

771
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:17,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

772
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:19,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie Thompson?

773
01:17:19,996 --> 01:17:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

774
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:23,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Caldera?

775
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:23,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

776
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:27,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the project is approved.

777
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:32,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thank you, folks, uh, for your partnership throughout the process.

778
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:39,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thank you, Attorney Haverty, uh, for the thorough decision and for your support throughout.

779
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:41,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to city staff.

780
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:42,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to our peer reviewers.

781
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thanks, thanks to all involved.

782
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:53,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, yeah, uh, we will work with Attorney Haverty to get the final decision recorded.

783
01:17:53,684 --> 01:17:55,085
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we'll do that in

784
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: the next 15 days.

785
01:17:57,463 --> 01:18:01,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So Attorney Haverty, I'll be in touch with you and Dennis about that.

786
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:08,329
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, yeah, I will, um, see the chair back to Jamie.

787
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

788
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:20,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, following the remainder of cases in order, we will move on to 28 Winford Way.

789
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:22,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, could you read that case?

790
01:18:24,879 --> 01:18:28,902
[SPEAKER_04]: 28 Winford Way, case number 8-2024-07, meeting from April 25th.

791
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:39,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owner Anthony Monaco is pushing for a variance in Chapter 94, City of Memphis zoning to install a fence over six feet tall at 28 Winford Way, which is not allowed by City of Memphis zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 4.2.5.

792
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dennis.

793
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

794
01:18:45,814 --> 01:18:46,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

795
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:55,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, good evening, everyone.

796
01:18:55,951 --> 01:18:56,531
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me OK?

797
01:18:57,712 --> 01:18:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We can.

798
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:00,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

799
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:02,936
[SPEAKER_18]: So we came by.

800
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:04,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually measured the fence entirely.

801
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:10,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can show you guys a map here that we have.

802
01:19:10,783 --> 01:19:12,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just share my screen with you.

803
01:19:12,024 --> 01:19:15,566
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

804
01:19:22,112 --> 01:19:23,553
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so this is 28 Winkford Way.

805
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:29,839
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've color coded just to make it easier to represent the green areas on the property.

806
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,902
[SPEAKER_18]: We are looking at between 40 to 72 inches.

807
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,763
[SPEAKER_18]: I measured inches just because it's a little easier.

808
01:19:35,844 --> 01:19:43,130
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're looking at 73 to 109 in the yellow areas and 1, 10 to 1, 20 in the red zone here.

809
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:45,872
[SPEAKER_18]: The neighboring property.

810
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:55,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Has a fence of 6 feet with posters that are around 8 feet.

811
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just get those images for you.

812
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:16,317
[SPEAKER_18]: So, what the owner is prepared to do is we'd like to propose to the board is reducing the fence around the property up to 24.

813
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:21,620
[SPEAKER_18]: Inches, which will give us a clearance will give us a height of around.

814
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:26,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, see, 89 to 90 inches, which will match.

815
01:20:27,339 --> 01:20:31,400
[SPEAKER_18]: The, uh, the neighbors posts, if that's something that to be allowed by the board.

816
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:37,482
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also wanted to clarify the homeowner to corner ship off the property when the fence was already erected.

817
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:42,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there was a little bit of a confusion as to the homeowner wanting to increase the fence.

818
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:43,984
[SPEAKER_18]: That was not the case.

819
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:46,145
[SPEAKER_18]: We know we added it on.

820
01:20:46,745 --> 01:20:50,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Prior to the owner taking ownership, so I just wanted to remove any confusion.

821
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:55,281
[SPEAKER_18]: The homeowner doesn't want to have any troubles with the surrounding neighbors.

822
01:20:56,522 --> 01:21:02,947
[SPEAKER_18]: But due to the typography of the lot, and I can show you another angle here as well.

823
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:10,933
[SPEAKER_18]: This fence here on this side, this is exactly six feet, right?

824
01:21:10,993 --> 01:21:18,920
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we remove the top three, we'll bring it down to about seven and a half, seven and a quarter.

825
01:21:21,363 --> 01:21:23,284
[SPEAKER_18]: on the left side of the property.

826
01:21:23,304 --> 01:21:26,424
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is something that we wanted to address.

827
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,625
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't have photos from inside the property.

828
01:21:28,645 --> 01:21:30,445
[SPEAKER_18]: As you can see, the typography is very unique.

829
01:21:31,145 --> 01:21:34,946
[SPEAKER_18]: So a six feet all around wouldn't really go well aesthetically.

830
01:21:34,986 --> 01:21:42,388
[SPEAKER_18]: And number two, the security reasons and privacy to the property, the owner is requesting to have it higher than six feet.

831
01:21:43,348 --> 01:21:49,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, we understand that it is significantly tall, especially if we're looking at surrounding neighbors.

832
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:53,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but if it's okay with our neighbors, okay with the board.

833
01:21:53,872 --> 01:22:00,696
[SPEAKER_18]: We can take a reduction on the fence and we can match it with the post of our surrounding neighbor.

834
01:22:00,736 --> 01:22:01,636
[SPEAKER_18]: If that's okay with the board.

835
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:06,439
[SPEAKER_18]: It will be a reduction of up to 2 feet.

836
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:12,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, go ahead.

837
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate clarification on.

838
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:19,934
[SPEAKER_02]: two things here.

839
01:22:19,954 --> 01:22:26,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I want to make sure at some point in this presentation, the board is crystal clear on

840
01:22:27,786 --> 01:22:32,390
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what is and isn't being proposed to reduce in height here.

841
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be really crisp on the relief being sought so that we can connect that to the topography and so on.

842
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:53,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, there were a number of neighbors who expressed concerns about the existing fence at the prior

843
01:22:56,397 --> 01:22:59,518
[SPEAKER_02]: prior session of this hearing where this was continued.

844
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like some details on whether this proposal has been discussed with the neighbors and whether they have indicated support or lack thereof for this proposal.

845
01:23:17,648 --> 01:23:26,580
[SPEAKER_18]: I called in a couple of days ago, and I asked, I forgot exactly who I spoke to it would be ideal to have this discussion prior to today's hearing, or just propose it to the board.

846
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:29,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Not sure if any other neighbors are on the call that way.

847
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:32,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone can can hear this proposal altogether.

848
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:35,109
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we are, right?

849
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:43,173
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also asked if the height maximum for fences is, I understand it's six feet.

850
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:46,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what are the maximum for posts, right?

851
01:23:46,994 --> 01:23:50,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Our neighbors have posts that are above that, around 88 inches.

852
01:23:51,857 --> 01:23:56,379
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why we're proposing to bring it down to match those post heights.

853
01:23:56,539 --> 01:24:01,561
[SPEAKER_18]: That way, we can sort of compromise on both sides and to the approval of the board.

854
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:12,160
[SPEAKER_18]: It will still be taller than 6 feet in most areas, but at least it won't be cumbersome to our neighbors where it's a lot taller than what they have currently on their yards.

855
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:20,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but I'm still unclear on where this is actually.

856
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:24,073
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced in the proposal.

857
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:32,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I understand it, anything on this figure that is green is already in compliance.

858
01:24:34,763 --> 01:24:37,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange and red is not.

859
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:44,352
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposal is also not in compliance, but is certainly less extreme than the red and

860
01:24:45,460 --> 01:25:13,743
[SPEAKER_02]: less extreme than maybe some of the orange, but is this, that the fence would uniformly be, if in excess of that amount, I forget the number of inches you said, would be cut down, or is this, it's just a little hard for me to make sense of what exactly is the new proposal, what is the- So 88 inches, let's say here on this yellow line here, it's seven feet and three inches.

861
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:19,566
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be the proposed for this side and I think I can show you in pictures.

862
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:22,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I just don't have a way to.

863
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Show you what it look what it would have looked like instead.

864
01:25:27,696 --> 01:25:27,916
[SPEAKER_18]: But.

865
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:39,974
[SPEAKER_18]: So here, right, if we propose to go down to, you know, 7 feet and 3 inches, we'll be matching the height of these posts to our neighbor.

866
01:25:40,414 --> 01:25:45,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I think she was the one that expressed most concern and most, you know, discomfort with the height of the fence.

867
01:25:46,377 --> 01:25:53,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if I were to move along, so to our left side here, one second.

868
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,942
[SPEAKER_18]: So here, it would be a reduction of 2 feet.

869
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as you can see, we're kind of on a degrading hill.

870
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:07,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, this here would be a deduction of around 17 inches.

871
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:12,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it won't be exactly the same all around because the topography of the property is not leveled.

872
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:20,245
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking at making an adjustment between 17 inches to 24 all around.

873
01:26:20,886 --> 01:26:23,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure that we have, number one, a cohesive fence.

874
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:29,112
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not 100% level as it is, but we would like to make it a little bit more appealing, right?

875
01:26:29,132 --> 01:26:35,497
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we reduce, let's say down to two feet in certain areas, we need to make sure that all around we just don't chop off everything else.

876
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:41,802
[SPEAKER_18]: But it will be higher than six feet still in most, you know, big portion of the lot.

877
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:51,689
[SPEAKER_18]: But like I said, a reduction of up to two feet in the areas that you see marked in yellow and red would be quite significant.

878
01:26:51,729 --> 01:26:59,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And like I said, especially for the neighbor here on our right side, depending on how you're looking on the left side, it would be matching her posts.

879
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:02,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would be a reduction of about 18 inches on her side.

880
01:27:02,855 --> 01:27:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

881
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:06,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

882
01:27:07,197 --> 01:27:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing I'll say, just as a procedural matter,

883
01:27:13,616 --> 01:27:21,323
[SPEAKER_02]: The only options we really have here, if we're going to consider this proposal as I see it, is that we would have to choose the

884
01:27:27,328 --> 01:27:31,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The up to number and the relief is in terms of the up to number.

885
01:27:31,332 --> 01:27:41,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if with the variance, someone can build a fence that's lower than the up to number or we would need plans that actually make it clear the heights at all points.

886
01:27:41,602 --> 01:27:48,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now this plan doesn't Describe the actual relief required.

887
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:54,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I have measurements of every single, I have measurements of every single post.

888
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:58,653
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't think it would be necessary to put it here, but to your point, I can add it in and submit it.

889
01:27:58,673 --> 01:27:59,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

890
01:27:59,954 --> 01:28:05,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, what we're seeing is current heights and what's meeting and violating.

891
01:28:05,718 --> 01:28:08,520
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not seeing a proposed resolution.

892
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:13,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want a proposed on every single post line for around the property?

893
01:28:13,404 --> 01:28:14,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I can do that.

894
01:28:15,985 --> 01:28:16,986
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think we need to.

895
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:26,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would say if you're completed with your presentation, let's open to the board.

896
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:32,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, anybody else have any other questions about what's been presented at the moment?

897
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

898
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:48,959
[SPEAKER_06]: If everybody, I do want to open it up to the public to comment on what's been presented.

899
01:28:48,979 --> 01:29:01,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel from the board perspective, we do want to see a resolution, but I think comments if the neighbors are on would be helpful to understand if there's something that would be considered.

900
01:29:03,249 --> 01:29:08,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see Lisa, do you want to unmute yourself and go ahead?

901
01:29:11,538 --> 01:29:12,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi, thank you.

902
01:29:14,679 --> 01:29:15,979
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things.

903
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,141
[SPEAKER_01]: At the last meeting, my neighbor is D'Amico's.

904
01:29:23,162 --> 01:29:25,402
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an engineer, correct me if I'm wrong.

905
01:29:25,482 --> 01:29:30,984
[SPEAKER_01]: He measured the fence, and he measured the highest point of the fence as being nine feet.

906
01:29:31,044 --> 01:29:31,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still unclear.

907
01:29:34,045 --> 01:29:48,268
[SPEAKER_01]: why you as the contractor, this should have been an independent person from the city measuring, because you're the contractor obviously in favor of the applicant, and I think we need an unbiased, effective, accurate measurement of the fence.

908
01:29:49,188 --> 01:29:55,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, my neighbor on the other side measured it, and he showed the measurements, it was nine feet.

909
01:29:55,629 --> 01:29:59,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I see, I have- I'm sorry, could you just give your name and address for the record?

910
01:30:00,293 --> 01:30:02,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Lisa D. Fabritas, 32 Winford Way.

911
01:30:03,174 --> 01:30:05,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one with the post that he's referring to.

912
01:30:05,815 --> 01:30:08,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on my side, my fence is six foot.

913
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:13,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the post there a little bit higher, because I put my fence in, but I can cut that plastic down.

914
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,858
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.

915
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I can bring the post down, it's plastic, and cut it down to the six foot.

916
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:28,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And the contractor, I just feel like he keeps bringing back safety, security, privacy.

917
01:30:29,203 --> 01:30:31,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to hear what that's all about.

918
01:30:32,366 --> 01:30:33,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I really would.

919
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:40,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we live in a great street, in a great neighborhood, and I don't understand, keep focusing on that point.

920
01:30:40,714 --> 01:30:45,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as them making a proposal to you, what about bringing a proposal to the neighbors?

921
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:50,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as you just noted, every one of us, no one's happy with this.

922
01:30:50,624 --> 01:30:55,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the proposal should be, I mean, no one's not willing to work and communicate with the neighbor.

923
01:30:55,227 --> 01:30:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never reached out to us.

924
01:30:56,809 --> 01:30:58,250
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried to reach out to them.

925
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:06,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I'm happy to, I think we're all like to be friendly and kind of resolve this and kind of find a compromise.

926
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's right for the contractor or the owner to make the decision on how much they want it to bring it down.

927
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:16,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have photos that I sent to the board a few days ago.

928
01:31:17,424 --> 01:31:18,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to pull it up.

929
01:31:19,325 --> 01:31:23,707
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see on the fence, there is the three-foot extension that they added.

930
01:31:23,727 --> 01:31:27,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you had, did you all receive the images that I sent to the board?

931
01:31:27,848 --> 01:31:34,771
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see on the image, there's a clear extension where they added the extra three feet after the six-foot fence was put up.

932
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:37,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So the three feet additional was put up afterwards.

933
01:31:37,812 --> 01:31:41,513
[SPEAKER_01]: We assumed it was at the request of the owner, but it could have been the contractor.

934
01:31:41,533 --> 01:31:42,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.

935
01:31:42,573 --> 01:31:46,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very clean line to cut that three feet down to make it to the six.

936
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:47,695
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it.

937
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the pictures.

938
01:31:48,775 --> 01:31:50,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you've got a wood cut thing.

939
01:31:50,556 --> 01:31:51,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very clean slate.

940
01:31:52,536 --> 01:31:57,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you want to say, OK, can it be six feet and six and a half feet?

941
01:31:57,397 --> 01:32:01,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm willing to, you know, that's not going to bother me, per se.

942
01:32:01,898 --> 01:32:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we have to, you know, this has to be a mutual agreement and it has to be agreeable.

943
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:09,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the fence is just ridiculous right now.

944
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nine foot.

945
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the whole back is one nine feet tall and it should be consistent.

946
01:32:14,803 --> 01:32:20,007
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest piece should come down to one specific, one determined height.

947
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:26,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what that height will be, technically the county, the city says it's six feet.

948
01:32:26,472 --> 01:32:28,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's already what the ordinance is.

949
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:29,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question is,

950
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:34,759
[SPEAKER_01]: do we, you know, we willing to agree that, okay, we can be a little bit higher?

951
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have to discuss it.

952
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:38,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's discuss it.

953
01:32:38,563 --> 01:32:41,326
[SPEAKER_01]: You go by my post, my post, because I have a little one post.

954
01:32:41,346 --> 01:32:42,087
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a fence.

955
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:46,331
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple of posts that might stick up every, every, like, every eight feet wide.

956
01:32:46,351 --> 01:32:47,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cut it down.

957
01:32:47,973 --> 01:32:49,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to cut it down to six feet.

958
01:32:49,474 --> 01:32:52,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you're going to cut the fence down to six feet to match my fence?

959
01:32:53,258 --> 01:33:01,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, again, I just feel like this is a conversation that should not be between just the board in the contractor and the applicant.

960
01:33:02,508 --> 01:33:11,997
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a conversation and a discussion that needs to be made with everybody who's affected in this fence, this excessively high fence is impacting, right?

961
01:33:13,398 --> 01:33:14,759
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely has to come down.

962
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:20,321
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, okay, does it have to come down to 6 or could it come down to maybe 6 and a half?

963
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:23,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the contract, for example, said.

964
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:29,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget how many inches he was suggesting to bring it down to the top of my post.

965
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:30,748
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nothing.

966
01:33:30,808 --> 01:33:31,369
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nothing.

967
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:31,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

968
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:38,918
[SPEAKER_01]: For that point, I might as well stay where it is for the minimal amount that they're suggesting to cut it down on my side.

969
01:33:39,418 --> 01:33:42,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, and again, I think this is...

970
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the building department has been out Paul Smith many times to the property.

971
01:33:53,652 --> 01:33:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been going on for a year.

972
01:33:55,533 --> 01:33:57,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the independent person come out and measure the fence.

973
01:33:58,053 --> 01:34:01,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have the natives go over there and all agree and talk about it.

974
01:34:01,474 --> 01:34:02,254
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to do that.

975
01:34:02,314 --> 01:34:03,255
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever done this.

976
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:04,655
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever reached out to us.

977
01:34:05,175 --> 01:34:08,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to them last year, didn't get a response.

978
01:34:09,019 --> 01:34:11,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to meet and happy to discuss and find a common ground here.

979
01:34:12,242 --> 01:34:15,625
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, the nine foot fence is not acceptable at all.

980
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:19,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And bringing it down 10 inches is not acceptable at all either, as far as I'm concerned.

981
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:23,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still don't understand the comments about privacy and security.

982
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:30,238
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because that's I don't know where that's even coming from, why that's even a conversation, a point of conversation.

983
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr different rates.

984
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:34,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

985
01:34:35,072 --> 01:34:38,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else from the public please raise your hand.

986
01:34:40,595 --> 01:34:46,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Wave your hand on the screen, or you can email Dennis directly.

987
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:48,760
[SPEAKER_06]: His email is in the chat.

988
01:34:52,122 --> 01:34:53,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Wayne amigo.

989
01:34:57,985 --> 01:35:01,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the of the board.

990
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:03,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Wayne Amico, Len Amico, 24 Alden Lane.

991
01:35:05,136 --> 01:35:15,022
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I want to state what we did last time, as we don't necessarily on our side, between 24 Alden and 28 Winford, we don't necessarily object to the height.

992
01:35:15,562 --> 01:35:29,490
[SPEAKER_21]: But before we make any other statements, I would like to see a plan, as you guys have mentioned, as to what is being proposed along all three sides, before we make any other statements of whether we're okay with it or not.

993
01:35:31,337 --> 01:35:41,299
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely don't want any additional height added to where the smaller, like I said, the contractor was nice enough to cut it down so my father didn't get killed backing up.

994
01:35:41,919 --> 01:35:48,601
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want all of a sudden this to become a huge fence all around and not be able to see backing out of the driveway.

995
01:35:48,661 --> 01:35:53,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Wayne said, I guess, I mean, I understand on the other side, it does look terrible.

996
01:35:55,598 --> 01:35:56,760
[SPEAKER_00]: with the three feet over.

997
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:00,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can understand why Lisa is upset about that.

998
01:36:01,205 --> 01:36:06,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't have a fence on our side, so it's not like it's up against something that we already have.

999
01:36:07,853 --> 01:36:14,821
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we'd like to know before we all decide, or however this gets decided, to see the proposal all the way around to see

1000
01:36:15,782 --> 01:36:16,782
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's gonna look like.

1001
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:20,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if our neighbor out next to us, what's that?

1002
01:36:20,323 --> 01:36:26,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't forget their number, but the house next to us, if that's the tallest part of the fence, I wanna know like what theirs will be.

1003
01:36:26,225 --> 01:36:28,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So if theirs get shorter, ours gets shorter.

1004
01:36:28,526 --> 01:36:36,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess like my husband said, we need to see a proposal for all the cuts and to be told that these other fences not gonna all of a sudden grow.

1005
01:36:37,528 --> 01:36:38,188
[SPEAKER_00]: That's already there.

1006
01:36:40,329 --> 01:36:40,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1007
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:41,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1008
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:43,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you just give your name and address for the record?

1009
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:46,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Wayne and let me go 24 Alden Lane.

1010
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:47,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1011
01:36:48,271 --> 01:36:48,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1012
01:36:49,051 --> 01:36:50,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Mr. Rodriguez.

1013
01:36:52,735 --> 01:36:59,681
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to clarify the owner is proposing a reduction, not an increase to Lisa's point.

1014
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:00,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

1015
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:06,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's fair for us to talk about someone's will to seek a little bit of more privacy and security.

1016
01:37:06,407 --> 01:37:06,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

1017
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:07,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a.

1018
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:10,346
[SPEAKER_18]: It's beyond discussion at this point.

1019
01:37:10,406 --> 01:37:15,571
[SPEAKER_18]: However, just to answer her questions, her post as as measured 7.3 inches tall.

1020
01:37:17,456 --> 01:37:28,288
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where the proposal is on that side of the fence to answer the family, the reduction on that side where you measure to be a much taller everywhere else.

1021
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:31,992
[SPEAKER_18]: It's looking at a 2 feet reduction and then trimmed everywhere else.

1022
01:37:32,032 --> 01:37:38,920
[SPEAKER_18]: So it looks a little bit more cohesive, but to answer the question of the board and to also all the surrounding neighbors.

1023
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:49,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we can provide post by post a, you know, actual number of where it will be reduced to if that will be more, you know, if that would be easier to facilitate someone coming up with a question.

1024
01:37:49,609 --> 01:37:51,751
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, with a decision, we can easily do that.

1025
01:37:52,511 --> 01:37:54,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, like, you know, we try to resolve this amicably.

1026
01:37:54,373 --> 01:37:57,535
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't live in that neighborhood, but I'm also a Metro residents.

1027
01:37:57,555 --> 01:37:58,716
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to make sure that, you know.

1028
01:37:59,437 --> 01:38:01,479
[SPEAKER_18]: If this gets taken care of in the best way possible.

1029
01:38:03,821 --> 01:38:04,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1030
01:38:06,591 --> 01:38:08,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a Jay Schnabel.

1031
01:38:09,194 --> 01:38:10,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1032
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:18,705
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, hi.

1033
01:38:18,885 --> 01:38:20,447
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Fred and Jenny Schnabel, 22 Alden Lane.

1034
01:38:20,467 --> 01:38:21,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And we would

1035
01:38:26,753 --> 01:38:33,219
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we'd like to maintain the best possible relations with all of our neighbors here, so we are open to a reduction.

1036
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:45,910
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if the what was the 83 inches is the number that we should land on, but we're definitely open to talking about it and.

1037
01:38:46,955 --> 01:38:56,901
[SPEAKER_20]: would add that we want to make sure that whatever the fence height does become, that it remains consistent around all the sides.

1038
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:08,948
[SPEAKER_20]: So Lisa's side and our side would be contiguous and the same level, essentially, rather than have ours higher, for instance, than everybody else's, if that makes sense.

1039
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:12,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your feedback.

1040
01:39:14,752 --> 01:39:17,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have anybody else from the public?

1041
01:39:17,674 --> 01:39:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dennis, do you have any emails?

1042
01:39:20,136 --> 01:39:26,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just please add, this is Lisa DeFabrius, one last comment regarding the comment regarding my post.

1043
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,002
[SPEAKER_01]: My fence is six foot, okay?

1044
01:39:29,142 --> 01:39:31,504
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of my posts that are higher, like you mentioned.

1045
01:39:32,104 --> 01:39:37,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not a fence to post, it's one little, I'm happy, again, I will bring that down, cut it, very easy.

1046
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:40,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want the fence because the fence, it's,

1047
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:58,080
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still way too high and it's just aesthetically an eyesore and I can't have, I'm not gonna, personally, my husband and I, we don't accept bringing it down to the post height because that's still a lot higher than the fence.

1048
01:39:59,021 --> 01:40:01,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring the post down to equal the six foot high fence.

1049
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:05,585
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem, but we have to find common ground on what that height will

1050
01:40:05,965 --> 01:40:06,745
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially be.

1051
01:40:07,366 --> 01:40:17,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I will simply say I want the, I request that the fence be to six feet, period, unless we find a common agreement, which I hope we can do.

1052
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:19,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

1053
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:20,491
[SPEAKER_06]: DePriest.

1054
01:40:20,511 --> 01:40:20,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1055
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other public comment?

1056
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dennis, just one last check for any emails.

1057
01:40:33,176 --> 01:40:33,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No emails.

1058
01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:35,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1059
01:40:36,786 --> 01:40:37,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair awaits a motion.

1060
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:43,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

1061
01:40:47,549 --> 01:40:48,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And second.

1062
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:49,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1063
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:50,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1064
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:51,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

1065
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:55,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1066
01:40:56,671 --> 01:40:56,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

1067
01:40:57,952 --> 01:40:58,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1068
01:40:59,032 --> 01:40:59,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary?

1069
01:41:00,272 --> 01:41:00,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1070
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:01,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

1071
01:41:02,413 --> 01:41:02,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1072
01:41:03,313 --> 01:41:04,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie, aye.

1073
01:41:05,414 --> 01:41:12,877
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so for the board at the moment, we have a proposal for a reduction, but without a plan.

1074
01:41:13,597 --> 01:41:14,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Feedback from the neighbors.

1075
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:18,379
[SPEAKER_06]: What does everybody think?

1076
01:41:26,903 --> 01:41:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, go ahead, Mary.

1077
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:34,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, thanks.

1078
01:41:34,908 --> 01:41:41,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think typically we do require a plan first before the proposal, right?

1079
01:41:41,811 --> 01:41:52,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I really would like to see what that plan is visually in light of the fact that the sentiments of the community.

1080
01:41:57,099 --> 01:41:59,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mary.

1081
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, go ahead.

1082
01:42:01,818 --> 01:42:07,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have concerns with the fence height even as proposed.

1083
01:42:08,601 --> 01:42:21,588
[SPEAKER_02]: We did hear this at a prior, there was a prior session of this hearing, we continued precisely so the proponent could provide these additional details on the fence.

1084
01:42:21,988 --> 01:42:30,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly the lot has topography issues, so I think there's some fence proposal that might be in excess of six feet in some areas that would be

1085
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:50,709
[SPEAKER_02]: warranted, but here yet again we're faced with a proposal that is asking for height on a relatively flat portion of the lot in excess of six feet because of posts and

1086
01:42:51,995 --> 01:42:56,140
[SPEAKER_02]: under the ordinance post can be a little bit more than six feet.

1087
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like very typical.

1088
01:42:57,782 --> 01:43:11,557
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a typical fence on a typical side, and we're getting a request to, for reasons unrelated to the topography on that side of the lot, to have a fence, you know, in excess of the ordinance.

1089
01:43:11,717 --> 01:43:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're getting

1090
01:43:14,495 --> 01:43:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty vague details.

1091
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they could be clarified, but all I'm seeing is a big fence, not enough detail.

1092
01:43:21,599 --> 01:43:23,940
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now the second hearing on this.

1093
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:30,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The neighbors don't like it, not consistent with the intent of the bylaw.

1094
01:43:30,323 --> 01:43:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not in favor of this proposal.

1095
01:43:37,226 --> 01:43:37,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

1096
01:43:38,007 --> 01:43:38,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

1097
01:43:39,868 --> 01:43:40,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so

1098
01:43:42,035 --> 01:43:50,172
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I, I agree would be helpful if we had the exact measurements and I think the applicant said that he could provide those.

1099
01:43:52,113 --> 01:43:52,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is good.

1100
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:55,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually don't think we're that far apart.

1101
01:43:55,614 --> 01:44:09,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, what I've heard from the direct abutters, I think two of the abutters seem to be leaning in the direction that a modest reduction of the fence would be viable.

1102
01:44:09,858 --> 01:44:16,859
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of the abutters has bigger concerns, but also an interest in

1103
01:44:19,073 --> 01:44:23,055
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, coming to agreement and perhaps allowing a little bit more than the six feet.

1104
01:44:23,115 --> 01:44:37,842
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just think that, I think we're probably not that far apart, but we do need to have kind of exact measurements so that we can make an approval.

1105
01:44:38,702 --> 01:44:43,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I guess, you know, I would suggest maybe

1106
01:44:44,787 --> 01:44:49,328
[SPEAKER_15]: just continuing this until we get that, you know, one more time until we get those numbers.

1107
01:44:49,548 --> 01:45:01,211
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime, you know, see if the applicant can kind of get that agreement from the abutters, you know, from the neighbors.

1108
01:45:06,792 --> 01:45:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come back to the applicant after we're finished with the board.

1109
01:45:10,753 --> 01:45:11,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, go ahead.

1110
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:20,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a whole month to talk to the neighbors and it sounds like no discussions happened.

1111
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:31,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So if members of the board want to consider continuing, I haven't formed an opinion whether I am or am not in favor of that right now.

1112
01:45:32,885 --> 01:45:37,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me to be in favor of it, I would fully expect that the applicant come back

1113
01:45:38,918 --> 01:45:53,504
[SPEAKER_02]: with the height of the fence at either six feet on Lisa DePriest's side or agreement from that household on a different height.

1114
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,305
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a topography issue there.

1115
01:45:55,505 --> 01:46:01,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really want to see a proposal in excess of six feet without the neighbor on board.

1116
01:46:02,848 --> 01:46:04,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have reservations.

1117
01:46:04,408 --> 01:46:05,509
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been plenty of time.

1118
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:11,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Before this even came before the zoning board, there's been back and forth with the building department.

1119
01:46:12,008 --> 01:46:13,668
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been repeated violations.

1120
01:46:14,189 --> 01:46:28,956
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not things that we consider in our analysis, but I really, I do not want to see another fence proposal that is in excess of six foot.

1121
01:46:30,309 --> 01:46:32,050
[SPEAKER_02]: for non-topographical reasons.

1122
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:39,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not what we asked for, not what we expected when we continued this the first time.

1123
01:46:43,653 --> 01:46:44,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

1124
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:48,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to check before I come back in.

1125
01:46:48,115 --> 01:46:49,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette, did you want to add anything?

1126
01:46:50,836 --> 01:46:51,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1127
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:58,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in agreement with Andre of I'd like to see more of the neighbor and

1128
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:03,208
[SPEAKER_08]: architecture and the owners coming together with an agreement.

1129
01:47:03,268 --> 01:47:09,352
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also just want to clarify that these are two different design aesthetics.

1130
01:47:10,012 --> 01:47:14,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's where some of this conversation needs to happen.

1131
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:22,860
[SPEAKER_08]: While I recognize post can be over the six feet, the other design aesthetic doesn't have that in that regard.

1132
01:47:23,701 --> 01:47:25,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, again, is why it should be

1133
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:30,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Held over to the next meeting so that they can have that discussion as a group.

1134
01:47:31,581 --> 01:47:33,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe come to some closure.

1135
01:47:35,963 --> 01:47:37,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of it under.

1136
01:47:38,283 --> 01:47:41,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the only other thing that I'd mentioned is that it would be great if we had.

1137
01:47:42,244 --> 01:47:48,746
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we have sorry, I couldn't find it right now in the folder of information, but.

1138
01:47:49,986 --> 01:47:54,088
[SPEAKER_15]: To see the topographical information again, because I'm not.

1139
01:47:56,713 --> 01:48:04,741
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'd be willing to consider a variance for something that's a little higher than than 6 feet, but I'd like to understand that.

1140
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,523
[SPEAKER_15]: It's because, as Mike said, there's some topography.

1141
01:48:12,984 --> 01:48:25,653
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not necessarily just topography, in my opinion, right at the fence line, but if the house in the rear sits significantly above, for example, then I can understand why there's a desire to have extra.

1142
01:48:27,654 --> 01:48:28,955
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, screening there.

1143
01:48:29,175 --> 01:48:36,662
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can't really make these final determinations without all of those measurements.

1144
01:48:39,145 --> 01:48:39,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Andrew.

1145
01:48:43,483 --> 01:48:44,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a similar spot.

1146
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:48,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a very visual person, so I need to be able to see, to understand.

1147
01:48:48,026 --> 01:48:49,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the measurements are there.

1148
01:48:49,667 --> 01:48:58,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I can comprehend it, but I did want, I mean, obviously, there was an expectation of some engagement in the past month and for a plan to come to us.

1149
01:48:59,513 --> 01:49:11,260
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like there was, I don't want to say there was limited effort, but there should have been a proposal to present to us at this point and some sort of consideration of the involvement of the neighbors.

1150
01:49:14,142 --> 01:49:18,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I will open to Mr. Rodriguez.

1151
01:49:18,144 --> 01:49:29,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the question to you from the board at the moment is, are you open to a continuance in order to act on the requests of the board and the neighbors that were expected?

1152
01:49:32,852 --> 01:49:34,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and thank you everyone for your time.

1153
01:49:34,353 --> 01:49:43,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to clarify the action plan here is to sit down, have the owners or myself sit down with the neighbors, discuss what is essentially agreeable

1154
01:49:44,856 --> 01:49:49,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Come down to a set of numbers, so we can then create a plan to present to the board prior to the meeting.

1155
01:49:49,682 --> 01:49:49,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct?

1156
01:49:50,775 --> 01:49:56,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, because as to understood up to this point, I have, like I said, I have measurements of every single post all throughout.

1157
01:49:57,018 --> 01:50:01,620
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I do not have a proposal of the reduction of set posts all around.

1158
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:08,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and that's to your guys's point in pursuant to having the meeting with the homeowners all around all of our neighbors.

1159
01:50:09,323 --> 01:50:12,625
[SPEAKER_18]: And then figuring out what that reduction could be, and then presented to the board.

1160
01:50:12,665 --> 01:50:15,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to make sure that that's the correct assumption on my end.

1161
01:50:16,595 --> 01:50:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And that proposal would need to include reasoning and for any variance from the six feet with regards to the hardship requirement in order to exceed that six feet.

1162
01:50:29,365 --> 01:50:29,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1163
01:50:30,105 --> 01:50:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: As to point some agreeability from the neighbor on that abutting side to the change.

1164
01:50:39,092 --> 01:50:39,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Understood.

1165
01:50:46,279 --> 01:50:48,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, any other comments from the board?

1166
01:50:55,565 --> 01:51:05,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to continue 280 Mystic Ave to the June, sorry.

1167
01:51:05,672 --> 01:51:06,052
[SPEAKER_06]: 28 Winford.

1168
01:51:06,072 --> 01:51:08,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, 28 Winford.

1169
01:51:08,774 --> 01:51:10,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll look down at the sheet.

1170
01:51:10,595 --> 01:51:10,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1171
01:51:12,735 --> 01:51:21,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to, uh, Board of Chair awaits a motion to continue 28 Winford Way to the June 27th regularly scheduled meeting of the Medford.

1172
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

1173
01:51:24,781 --> 01:51:25,062
Thank you.

1174
01:51:28,443 --> 01:51:28,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mary.

1175
01:51:29,304 --> 01:51:30,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, roll call.

1176
01:51:30,644 --> 01:51:31,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mike Caldera?

1177
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:34,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1178
01:51:35,707 --> 01:51:36,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew LaRue?

1179
01:51:36,848 --> 01:51:36,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1180
01:51:37,008 --> 01:51:38,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette Velez?

1181
01:51:39,789 --> 01:51:39,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1182
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:41,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Lee?

1183
01:51:43,075 --> 01:51:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Jamie Thompson I. Thank you everybody for your time today.

1184
01:51:48,937 --> 01:51:52,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We look forward to something to make a decision on at the next meeting.

1185
01:51:57,219 --> 01:51:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: The next case by order, Dennis, please.

1186
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: 178 Fulton street case number 8 dash 2024 dash 9 continue for April 25th.

1187
01:52:07,383 --> 01:52:19,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owner James Reed is petitioning for a variance in Chapter 94 City Method zoning to install a new curb cut and driveway in the front yard of the property at 178 Folsom Street, which is not allowed for the City Method zoning owners, Chapter 94, Section 6.1.4.3.

1188
01:52:23,146 --> 01:52:23,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

1189
01:52:23,927 --> 01:52:25,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a representative for the applicants?

1190
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:30,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1191
01:52:30,868 --> 01:52:32,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, members of the board.

1192
01:52:32,448 --> 01:52:33,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Henry Rapid, Jr.

1193
01:52:33,409 --> 01:52:34,729
[SPEAKER_09]: on behalf of Mr. Reed.

1194
01:52:37,628 --> 01:52:38,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Mr. Edna.

1195
01:52:44,112 --> 01:52:57,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the last hearing, Mr. Reed and I have met with Owen Wartella, and he has indeed sent an email that I forwarded to Dennis earlier today with three other attachments.

1196
01:52:58,441 --> 01:53:03,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And the city, in his opinion, takes no exception to the proposed curb cut.

1197
01:53:04,759 --> 01:53:14,863
[SPEAKER_09]: He did give Mr. Reed a copy of the typical driveway apron curb cut and said any permit would be conditioned upon following that.

1198
01:53:15,463 --> 01:53:17,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Reed has no issue with that at all.

1199
01:53:19,644 --> 01:53:28,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We have narrowed on the amended plan the curb cut from 18 feet to 16 feet and moved it over a little bit.

1200
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:30,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Owen Wartella,

1201
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:39,127
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also in an area where there is no parking a lot at the end of Fulton Street.

1202
01:53:39,628 --> 01:53:47,636
[SPEAKER_09]: So it actually is a very diminished impact on street parking from having this curb cut.

1203
01:53:52,953 --> 01:53:58,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Reid also submitted a couple of sketches of what the landscaping would look like from this plan.

1204
01:53:59,456 --> 01:54:06,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was our attempt to comply with all the requests from the board in our April 25th meeting.

1205
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:13,143
[SPEAKER_09]: But from what we can see, the city department had no issue with the proposed relief.

1206
01:54:20,906 --> 01:54:21,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Raba.

1207
01:54:22,027 --> 01:54:23,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the board?

1208
01:54:23,427 --> 01:54:33,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, we'll open to public comment.

1209
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone from the public wishing to speak, please raise your hand on Zoom, wave, we do have to unmute at the moment, or send an email to dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

1210
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So none in the room, Dennis, do you have any additional emails or comment?

1211
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not, but just also in the package that attorney represent there was a letter of support from the butter.

1212
01:55:18,949 --> 01:55:21,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want me to just note that for the record.

1213
01:55:23,031 --> 01:55:23,351
Thank you.

1214
01:55:28,834 --> 01:55:29,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael Ruiz, 45 St.

1215
01:55:29,655 --> 01:55:31,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis Street in support.

1216
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:34,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1217
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need?

1218
01:55:34,887 --> 01:55:35,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to read the letter.

1219
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing I think just saying in the support is the address given the proximity to the properties.

1220
01:55:43,934 --> 01:55:44,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1221
01:55:45,915 --> 01:55:46,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure where it's emotion.

1222
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:56,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1223
01:56:00,807 --> 01:56:01,247
That's it.

1224
01:56:02,949 --> 01:56:08,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1225
01:56:08,975 --> 01:56:09,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1226
01:56:09,075 --> 01:56:11,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mary Lee.

1227
01:56:18,725 --> 01:56:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1228
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:22,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie Thompson.

1229
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:26,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I comments from the board.

1230
01:56:39,928 --> 01:56:42,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris?

1231
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:44,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1232
01:56:44,611 --> 01:56:46,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps through you to the representative.

1233
01:56:47,913 --> 01:57:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: We did hear at the last meeting, or last month anyway, the first hearing of this, that there was an issue with using the existing drive or the existing parking that is in front of that

1234
01:57:05,957 --> 01:57:08,857
[SPEAKER_03]: garage of sorts that goes underneath the house.

1235
01:57:09,618 --> 01:57:22,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to know how that remains and if that will still be used, because we heard it was not being used and wasn't able to be used.

1236
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:35,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the plan that was submitted, I see it remains, and I'm curious to know how that interfaces with the proposed drive that goes up

1237
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: and around to the other street?

1238
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:39,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

1239
01:57:39,352 --> 01:57:51,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as you can see, the only way to get out of that existing driveway is to back out on the Fulton Street, which is, as we talked about during the last meeting, unsafe and unwise.

1240
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:56,763
[SPEAKER_09]: You could technically back out of that garage onto this proposed driveway.

1241
01:57:57,063 --> 01:57:59,105
[SPEAKER_09]: So you would be still able to use the garage.

1242
01:57:59,545 --> 01:58:02,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You just wouldn't be backing out on the Fulton Street.

1243
01:58:04,493 --> 01:58:06,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's my question.

1244
01:58:06,295 --> 01:58:18,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, it looks like you will be backing out into Fulton Street to then use the driveway to go up towards the perpendicular street.

1245
01:58:18,144 --> 01:58:20,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I forgot the name.

1246
01:58:22,283 --> 01:58:25,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see it that way when I was, I've been at the property two times.

1247
01:58:25,827 --> 01:58:26,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see it that way.

1248
01:58:26,908 --> 01:58:30,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it could be angled to get a car out without backing into Fulton Street.

1249
01:58:30,431 --> 01:58:32,173
[SPEAKER_09]: You're certainly not backing into traffic.

1250
01:58:32,853 --> 01:58:43,623
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be the benefit of, one of the many benefits of the proposed driveway is you're not backing any car from this property out into Fulton Street.

1251
01:58:43,924 --> 01:58:46,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're still being able to have the benefit of the garage.

1252
01:58:47,267 --> 01:58:52,691
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be difficult for one to abandon the garage going forward.

1253
01:58:52,871 --> 01:58:56,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have valuation on the property.

1254
01:58:57,594 --> 01:59:04,898
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be just certainly a hard thing to give up in perpetuity the use of the garage.

1255
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:10,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1256
01:59:12,783 --> 01:59:13,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chris.

1257
01:59:14,344 --> 01:59:16,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments from the board?

1258
01:59:19,547 --> 01:59:28,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, just a question about the materials that are going to be used for the surface of the driveway, and I apologize if you already addressed that.

1259
01:59:30,462 --> 01:59:30,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly.

1260
01:59:31,162 --> 01:59:36,725
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked to Owen Wartella, and he had told us pavers would be a choice.

1261
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:39,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Originally, Mr. Reed wanted to use P-stone.

1262
01:59:40,487 --> 01:59:45,850
[SPEAKER_09]: We were told that would be a, while the code still requires a variance for P-stone.

1263
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: He said it's in the works to change that.

1264
01:59:49,812 --> 01:59:54,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Reed is looking forward to get this done expeditiously.

1265
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:58,296
[SPEAKER_09]: He's willing to put pavers in and do it that way.

1266
01:59:58,376 --> 01:59:59,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be asphalt paved.

1267
02:00:00,741 --> 02:00:01,722
[SPEAKER_09]: We would just be pavers.

1268
02:00:02,322 --> 02:00:10,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said, we met with Mr. Wartella and discussed what would be amenable to engineering in the DPW.

1269
02:00:11,548 --> 02:00:11,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1270
02:00:11,768 --> 02:00:12,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1271
02:00:12,649 --> 02:00:12,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1272
02:00:21,974 --> 02:00:23,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the board?

1273
02:00:28,518 --> 02:00:29,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion.

1274
02:00:33,222 --> 02:00:42,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to chime in to say that I do appreciate having the details and the discussion from the city engineer.

1275
02:00:42,105 --> 02:00:45,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was one of our big open questions last time.

1276
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:49,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that helped to resolve some of my uncertainties on this proposal.

1277
02:00:56,633 --> 02:01:06,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Chair, I'd like to motion to approve the variance for the new curb cut in driveway at 178 Fulton Street.

1278
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:11,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1279
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Damian, I think you're muted.

1280
02:01:25,194 --> 02:01:26,195

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, members of the board.

1295
02:01:50,254 --> 02:01:54,277
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Attorney Rapa, if you could provide us with just a draft decision

1296
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:58,897
[SPEAKER_04]: and that would help expedite matters, that would be very helpful.

1297
02:01:59,337 --> 02:02:01,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, I'll have that to you early next week.

1298
02:02:02,057 --> 02:02:02,297

02:04:07,805 --> 02:04:08,265
[SPEAKER_06]: June 27th.

1328
02:04:08,426 --> 02:04:12,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, can you take us to the next case?

1329
02:04:21,853 --> 02:04:22,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, Dennis.

1330
02:04:25,568 --> 02:04:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

1331
02:04:26,528 --> 02:04:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: 400 Mystic Avenue, case number 8-2024-13.

1332
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:45,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owner Herb Chambers, 400 Mystic LLC, is petitioning for a variance to demolish an existing three-story structure and replace it with a new three-story structure 50.5 feet high at 400 Mystic Avenue, which is not allowed in a commercial two-zoning district, excuse me, under the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

1333
02:04:50,039 --> 02:04:50,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

1334
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a representative from 400 Mystic Avenue?

1335
02:04:54,397 --> 02:04:56,258
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Chairperson Thompson.

1336
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:57,839
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Frank Marinelli.

1337
02:04:57,899 --> 02:05:01,080
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a land use attorney for the Herb Chambers Companies.

1338
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:05,022
[SPEAKER_19]: My office is at 439 Washington Street, Braintree.

1339
02:05:05,662 --> 02:05:10,804
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had the privilege of representing Herb Chambers in his various developments for over 25 years.

1340
02:05:11,364 --> 02:05:15,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight, we propose significant investment and improvement

1341
02:05:16,557 --> 02:05:24,240
[SPEAKER_19]: at 400 Mystic Avenue, specifically the transformation of this commercial C2 property into Herb Chambers Toyota.

1342
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:30,142
[SPEAKER_19]: With me this evening is the director of construction for the Herb Chambers company, John Welch.

1343
02:05:30,802 --> 02:05:37,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Also here is our civil engineering team, Gabe Crocker and Dave Newhall of Crocker Design Group.

1344
02:05:38,265 --> 02:05:45,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Gabe and Dave presented the, they prepared the engineered plans that you have that were filed with the application.

1345
02:05:46,277 --> 02:05:52,580
[SPEAKER_19]: And also here is the project architect Lee Hemingway of Regent and Associates Architects.

1346
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:57,602
[SPEAKER_19]: They prepared the floor plans and the elevations that are part of our filing with the zoning board.

1347
02:05:58,562 --> 02:06:06,766
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll give an overview of the project and then if it's okay with the board, our team is happy to answer any questions that you or the public may have.

1348
02:06:08,347 --> 02:06:08,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the past 40...

1349
02:06:10,037 --> 02:06:10,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1350
02:06:10,758 --> 02:06:20,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the past 40 years, Herb Chambers has built a major regional business which entails approximately 60 motor vehicle dealerships employing over 1,500 people.

1351
02:06:21,526 --> 02:06:25,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Chambers' company has been named by the Boston Globe as one of the best places to work.

1352
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:33,696
[SPEAKER_19]: All of the Chambers facilities are maintained under the direction of corporate manager John Welch, who's on the Zoom with us.

1353
02:06:34,782 --> 02:06:45,932
[SPEAKER_19]: As the board knows, the 4.86 acre property in the building at 400 Mystic Avenue was owned by Century Bank and then Eastern Bank and used for banking and office purposes.

1354
02:06:46,653 --> 02:06:53,279
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2021, Herb Chambers 400 Mystic LLC acquired the commercial property for $20.5 million.

1355
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:59,645
[SPEAKER_19]: The current building is comprised, as you know, of an old three-story section at the northerly end.

1356
02:07:00,412 --> 02:07:11,559
[SPEAKER_19]: and a five-story section that received a height variance from the Zoning Board in 2001, decision number 2001-11, which I attached to the application, Mr. Chairman.

1357
02:07:12,643 --> 02:07:18,049
[SPEAKER_19]: The old three-story section is approximately 34.4 feet high.

1358
02:07:19,271 --> 02:07:20,252
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be demolished.

1359
02:07:20,673 --> 02:07:30,344
[SPEAKER_19]: The five-story tower section is approximately 73.6 feet high, and as I said previously, approved by the Zoning Board in 2001.

1360
02:07:32,868 --> 02:07:49,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Our proposal is to renovate the first four floors of the five-story tower section for sales, showroom, display of vehicles, along with sales and finance offices and customer amenities as shown on the filed floor plans and elevations.

1361
02:07:50,207 --> 02:07:54,712
[SPEAKER_19]: The footprint of the existing five-story tower stays as existing.

1362
02:07:56,174 --> 02:08:05,223
[SPEAKER_19]: We respectfully submit the reasonable Zoning Board relief that we're looking for is first to allow Chambers to build its new three-story service and parking section.

1363
02:08:05,843 --> 02:08:09,006
[SPEAKER_19]: The existing three-story section, as I stated, would be demolished.

1364
02:08:09,067 --> 02:08:14,372
[SPEAKER_19]: We've already processed and received a demolition permit for that old three-story section.

1365
02:08:15,148 --> 02:08:24,735
[SPEAKER_19]: The current dimensional ordinance Table B, Section 5E allows just two stories and 30 feet in the C2 zone, as the board knows.

1366
02:08:24,835 --> 02:08:32,441
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's infeasible for the proposed dealership use, and it's actually quite low for a commercial zone.

1367
02:08:33,103 --> 02:08:43,791
[SPEAKER_19]: The new 3 story section that we would construct is about approximately 550.5 feet is shown on the engineers zoning legend.

1368
02:08:43,871 --> 02:08:53,438
[SPEAKER_19]: And that would require the variants from table B, section 5 height restriction of 2 stories and 30 feet in the C2 zone.

1369
02:08:54,830 --> 02:09:00,674
[SPEAKER_19]: The existing three-story section, of course, already exceeds Table B, two stories and 30 feet.

1370
02:09:00,974 --> 02:09:04,857
[SPEAKER_19]: The new three-story section is comprised of the following.

1371
02:09:05,037 --> 02:09:12,122
[SPEAKER_19]: First, approximately 40 customer service bays will be on the first floor, which require a high ceiling.

1372
02:09:12,782 --> 02:09:18,227
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have interior parking on the second and third floors for over 200 cars.

1373
02:09:18,807 --> 02:09:28,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Interior parking for approximately 106 cars on each of the second and third floors on the new three-story section that we're proposing.

1374
02:09:28,776 --> 02:09:32,579
[SPEAKER_19]: The total new three-story section is approximately 125,775 square feet, or just over 40,000 square feet per floor.

1375
02:09:38,358 --> 02:09:55,648
[SPEAKER_19]: The Zoning Board relief is requested to construct the five-story car elevator, which is our second request, and that would connect to the new three-story service section and would be between the new three-story service section and the existing five-story tower.

1376
02:09:55,728 --> 02:10:07,815
[SPEAKER_19]: So there'd be approximately a five-story car elevator, and that would transport the vehicles to all levels of the vehicle showrooms in the five-story tower section.

1377
02:10:08,683 --> 02:10:16,150
[SPEAKER_19]: The resulting new elevations, architectural interests, and quality finishes are shown on the Region Associates architectural plans.

1378
02:10:17,151 --> 02:10:25,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Conversion and improvement to the building is an approximate $30 million investment in Medford, in addition to the over $20 million acquisition.

1379
02:10:26,599 --> 02:10:29,762
[SPEAKER_19]: The project will also provide about 50 to 75 new jobs.

1380
02:10:31,895 --> 02:10:48,301
[SPEAKER_19]: So the summary of the zoning relief for this board jurisdiction is grant of variance to allow the new three-story, 50.5-foot high service section, where only two stories and 30 feet is allowed in the C2 under Table B, Section 5E.

1381
02:10:48,462 --> 02:10:57,065
[SPEAKER_19]: And secondly, to grant variance to allow the five-story car elevator adjacent to the existing five-story tower

1382
02:10:57,965 --> 02:11:06,812
[SPEAKER_19]: To enable the transport of cars to 5 floors of display in the existing 5 story structure approved by the board in 2001.

1383
02:11:09,033 --> 02:11:16,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Just briefly a discussion of the variance standards, which I know are always important to the board in section 3 of the application materials.

1384
02:11:16,398 --> 02:11:20,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And we tried to address each of the 7 sections comprehensively.

1385
02:11:21,263 --> 02:11:30,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Section 3, we describe the circumstances relating to shape, topography, soil conditions that cause substantial hardship and warrant the reasonable relief requested from the height limitation.

1386
02:11:30,793 --> 02:11:32,735
[SPEAKER_19]: First, the shape of the lot is irregular.

1387
02:11:32,755 --> 02:11:39,542
[SPEAKER_19]: The lot has an obtuse shape at the northerly portion and an elongated shape at the southerly portion.

1388
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:51,591
[SPEAKER_19]: The shape of the lot and the existing structures upon it are restrictive hardships that require the new 3 story section for the dealership use with 1st floor service and 2 levels of interior parking.

1389
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:57,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Additional vehicles cannot be accommodated outside due to lot shape existing building and site constraints.

1390
02:11:58,771 --> 02:12:11,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, there is a state access restriction to the property that requires us to locate the access to the new service building where it is proposed away from the I-93 off-ramp.

1391
02:12:12,264 --> 02:12:16,969
[SPEAKER_19]: This property is uniquely surrounded on every side by roadway, road network, including the I-93.

1392
02:12:18,988 --> 02:12:30,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Thirdly, creating a basement level to go subterranean is infeasible due to soil conditions of generally loose fill, silt, gravel, groundwater level as determined by our engineers.

1393
02:12:31,457 --> 02:12:40,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Given the soil conditions, the shape of the lot, the juxtaposition of the existing five-story building upon it, the feasible direction

1394
02:12:40,842 --> 02:12:52,649
[SPEAKER_19]: but construction of needed dealership service to accompany the sales showroom and parking is above ground as proposed in the new three-story section that's shown on our plans.

1395
02:12:54,350 --> 02:13:07,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Fourthly, the existing three-story building itself is also a hardship in somewhat rundown condition, cannot be retrofitted for the dealership use that will be encompassed in the brand new three-story section that we're proposing.

1396
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:17,188
[SPEAKER_19]: The three-story section to be demolished has deteriorated wooden piles, rendering any retrofitting infeasible for dealership use.

1397
02:13:17,942 --> 02:13:37,466
[SPEAKER_19]: So the site hardships requiring reasonable height variance consistent with the height granted in 2001 are unique and owing to the shape of the lot, the juxtaposition of the structures upon it, hardship owing to the structure itself and soil conditions and topography, the soil conditions being what we described.

1398
02:13:37,846 --> 02:13:43,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Limiting the proposed substantial investment that we are proposing to two stories and 30 feet

1399
02:13:44,298 --> 02:13:49,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Without relief would be an insurmountable hardship and the project would not move forward.

1400
02:13:49,641 --> 02:13:55,304
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is really what you request in Section 4 of the application, which we filed with the board.

1401
02:13:55,785 --> 02:14:04,990
[SPEAKER_19]: That substantial hardship would result from not granting the requested relief from the restrictive two-story, 30-foot limitation, because without relief, the project

1402
02:14:05,507 --> 02:14:06,527
[SPEAKER_19]: would not be possible.

1403
02:14:06,587 --> 02:14:07,868
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an integrated project.

1404
02:14:07,908 --> 02:14:19,411
[SPEAKER_19]: The dealership use in the five-story existing building does not occur without the proposed three-story brand-new service building and parking building, which is integral to dealership use.

1405
02:14:19,511 --> 02:14:21,791
[SPEAKER_19]: So the project is comprehensive.

1406
02:14:21,871 --> 02:14:22,852
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not piecemeal.

1407
02:14:22,912 --> 02:14:33,515
[SPEAKER_19]: And the proposed new three-story section is actually 20 feet less in height, over 20 feet less in height than the already approved five-story section approved by the board in 2001.

1408
02:14:35,388 --> 02:14:40,211
[SPEAKER_19]: We respectfully submit there's no harm or detriment, only improvement that is brought with this project.

1409
02:14:40,772 --> 02:14:50,798
[SPEAKER_19]: And that brings us to the final evaluation and the grant of reasonable relief that we're requesting from the two-story, 30-foot limitation of Table B, Section 5E.

1410
02:14:51,339 --> 02:15:04,087
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is the fact that the grant of the height variance to allow three-story service building and a five-story car elevator connection to the existing five-story sales and display section will not cause substantial detriment to the public good.

1411
02:15:04,836 --> 02:15:07,698
[SPEAKER_19]: First, the modest height relief for this commercial property.

1412
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:25,532
[SPEAKER_19]: It already has a five-story tower, and the height relief we're requesting, Mr. Chair and members of the Board, is the only dimension that requires reasonable relief for the opportunity to move forward with this project for MEDFED and the tax base and the economic benefits that accompany it.

1413
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:29,601
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposal complies with all other dimensional requirements.

1414
02:15:30,902 --> 02:15:33,805
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, there's no substantial detriment.

1415
02:15:33,885 --> 02:15:41,571
[SPEAKER_19]: We believe that it's vast improvement, the infusion investment of millions of dollars in commercial improvement and commercial tax base for Medfed.

1416
02:15:41,992 --> 02:15:49,358
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we calculate to be over 50 new jobs and again, no substantial detriment.

1417
02:15:50,755 --> 02:15:53,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I made the point that three stories already exist at the site.

1418
02:15:53,936 --> 02:15:55,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Five stories also exist at the site.

1419
02:15:56,157 --> 02:16:02,359
[SPEAKER_19]: The metrics that we're working under already exist at the site per the 2001 variance decision.

1420
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:09,362
[SPEAKER_19]: The height of the car elevator connecting to the existing five stories is, again, consistent with the existing five-story height.

1421
02:16:10,574 --> 02:16:17,661
[SPEAKER_19]: In furtherance of no substantial detriment, Herb Chambers and Toyota, we respectfully submit our premier brands.

1422
02:16:18,141 --> 02:16:20,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Toyota is a leader in electric vehicles.

1423
02:16:20,764 --> 02:16:24,067
[SPEAKER_19]: The project is consistent with the purpose of the C2 district.

1424
02:16:24,672 --> 02:16:29,133
[SPEAKER_19]: The city of Medford can grow to commercial tax base with the significant improvements.

1425
02:16:29,673 --> 02:16:43,977
[SPEAKER_19]: The project, I think this is important, makes single purpose use of a large vacant office building at a time when the office building class of assets, as we all know, is experiencing significant difficulty nationwide and in the greater Boston market.

1426
02:16:44,497 --> 02:16:59,822
[SPEAKER_19]: This project provides a new use, a comprehensive single user, significant established strong brands with both Herb Chambers and Toyota for a large vacant office property that might otherwise face a protracted occupancy challenge.

1427
02:17:00,683 --> 02:17:07,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Further, Herb Chambers Toyota is expected to use less water sewer than the prior office building use of the property.

1428
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:18,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, Herb Chambers, Toyota, is expected to generate less peak hour vehicle trips as compared to the prior office building use of the property.

1429
02:17:18,659 --> 02:17:28,407
[SPEAKER_19]: And we do have the traffic report of Campbell Engineering Associates that says exactly that, 686 fewer trips than an Azebrite bank and office uses.

1430
02:17:29,908 --> 02:17:34,112
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's, again, on the point of no substantial detriment

1431
02:17:35,348 --> 02:17:40,351
[SPEAKER_19]: We think that it presents architectural interests with use of quality materials environmentally.

1432
02:17:40,912 --> 02:17:44,074
[SPEAKER_19]: The project will enhance stormwater treatment and management.

1433
02:17:45,535 --> 02:17:50,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Crocker and his firm have a stormwater management report that so concludes.

1434
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,583
[SPEAKER_19]: And the project plans also show robust landscaping.

1435
02:17:55,043 --> 02:18:00,127
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got hundreds of new plantings and aesthetics, and I think we have a landscape plan that we can put up there.

1436
02:18:01,225 --> 02:18:11,080
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all benefits and improvement, not substantial detriment, consistent with the Herb Chambers brand and the level of quality that we try to deliver in all of our dealerships.

1437
02:18:12,822 --> 02:18:27,592
[SPEAKER_19]: So the project, we also believe, is consistent, certainly not substantially more detrimental in terms of nearby commercial uses in the C2 area, which is a mix of industrial, warehouse, automotive, and retail, as the board knows.

1438
02:18:28,072 --> 02:18:39,880
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Jason Trucks, truck sales, tractor-trailer storage, C's gas station, AeroCycle, Millennium Maintenance, power sweeping, foreign domestic auto repair, gas, inman motor sales,

1439
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:58,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Colonial Volkswagen, AutoZone, Public Storage, Dunkin' Donuts, Northeast Electrical Distributors, Garmin Construction Products, Deaf Spring Company, Fresnias Kidney Care, Abilinos, I-93 Interchange, Car Wash, Bank of America, just to name some of the neighboring nearby uses.

1440
02:18:58,870 --> 02:19:05,554
[SPEAKER_19]: So in conclusion, we respectfully submit that the project provides an opportunity for improvement with no substantial detriment.

1441
02:19:06,842 --> 02:19:14,968
[SPEAKER_19]: the 50 more new jobs, millions of dollars of investment in the C2 zone, significant increase in properties, tax-based economic development.

1442
02:19:15,988 --> 02:19:31,018
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also wanted to add, Mr. Chair, that on June 5th next week, the applicant, we're also before the CDB for the USpecial Permanent Site Plan Review per Table A, principal uses of the zoning ordinance.

1443
02:19:31,518 --> 02:19:34,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So we respectfully request in conclusion that the board

1444
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,662
[SPEAKER_19]: consider and grant the height variance relief from Table B, Section 5E.

1445
02:19:41,162 --> 02:19:55,206
[SPEAKER_19]: First, to allow the new three-story building section that we're proposing for the file plans, and secondly, to allow the new five-story car elevator to be connected to the existing five-story section.

1446
02:19:55,766 --> 02:20:03,448
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that, we're happy to answer any questions that the board or the public may have, and appreciate your attention and consideration.

1447
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:08,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1448
02:20:09,401 --> 02:20:10,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions from the board?

1449
02:20:10,481 --> 02:20:11,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Mike has his hand up.

1450
02:20:11,562 --> 02:20:12,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Mike.

1451
02:20:12,983 --> 02:20:23,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in the project narrative, it points out how there's a few possible options in terms of relief here.

1452
02:20:23,188 --> 02:20:30,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new variance or there's amending the existing variance.

1453
02:20:31,192 --> 02:20:35,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on

1454
02:20:36,821 --> 02:20:56,699
[SPEAKER_02]: In the latter case, the actual relief required by the amendment here, it's a height variance, and it would just be amending it to reflect that the prior variance pertained to a particular site plan, and now the site plan is different.

1455
02:20:56,739 --> 02:20:59,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a different proposal, a different use, and so on.

1456
02:21:01,533 --> 02:21:12,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So the amendment would just be to reflect that the height variance in terms of magnitude is the same, but the actual proposed structure is different.

1457
02:21:13,943 --> 02:21:14,604
[SPEAKER_19]: That's correct.

1458
02:21:15,144 --> 02:21:19,128
[SPEAKER_19]: The, as the board knows, when you grant a variance, the.

1459
02:21:19,906 --> 02:21:21,808
[SPEAKER_19]: The dimension is then deemed conforming.

1460
02:21:22,209 --> 02:21:25,011
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't become some kind of non-conforming dimension.

1461
02:21:25,412 --> 02:21:31,078
[SPEAKER_19]: The five stories is an approved dimension per the 2001 decision.

1462
02:21:31,819 --> 02:21:41,188
[SPEAKER_19]: And that decision, as you point out, could be modified to say that the variances in terms of height and relief from Table B, Section 5E,

1463
02:21:42,749 --> 02:21:57,772
[SPEAKER_19]: is granted per the plans that show the new three-story section at 50.5 feet and the car elevator not exceeding the previously approved height of the five stories per the 2001 decision.

1464
02:21:58,852 --> 02:21:59,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

1465
02:21:59,212 --> 02:21:59,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1466
02:22:00,013 --> 02:22:06,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this next one, this has come up a few times and it's still a point of uncertainty for me.

1467
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:21,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the board here is being asked to grant some relief for a project that has still needs to visit the community development board, who then might change the project.

1468
02:22:22,326 --> 02:22:24,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little unclear to me.

1469
02:22:25,878 --> 02:22:27,799
[SPEAKER_02]: like, would this need to revisit us?

1470
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:40,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Because here, the ask is to either grant a new variance or to amend the existing variance to reflect a specific site plan, which will then go before the CDB that might change it.

1471
02:22:41,003 --> 02:22:41,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1472
02:22:42,383 --> 02:22:47,925
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if there was a material change, then we would probably

1473
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:54,953
[SPEAKER_19]: have to come back to the board and, you know, the public hearing could be kept open.

1474
02:22:54,993 --> 02:23:02,517
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that everything we've done really has been comprehensively planned, and this is the way it works.

1475
02:23:02,837 --> 02:23:15,804
[SPEAKER_19]: So if there were, you know, non-major changes, we would certainly be happy to file an updated plan, but it would not materially change the project.

1476
02:23:17,525 --> 02:23:17,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1477
02:23:17,885 --> 02:23:18,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1478
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:20,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Senior planner Evans.

1479
02:23:24,281 --> 02:23:24,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

1480
02:23:24,802 --> 02:23:25,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1481
02:23:25,122 --> 02:23:26,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Daniel Evans, senior planner.

1482
02:23:28,323 --> 02:23:35,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so the community development board is a site plan review authority and the special permit granting authority for vehicle use.

1483
02:23:37,768 --> 02:23:51,400
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as granting the height variance, so that's needed so that the city board can approve a site plan, because they can't approve a site plan that is in conflict with the zoning.

1484
02:23:51,880 --> 02:23:59,727
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would recommend that you not approve a set of, like a specific plan set.

1485
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:12,121
[SPEAKER_12]: that takes into account the site plan because it's going to change, but I don't think the building footprint or the height of the proposed building will change.

1486
02:24:12,141 --> 02:24:19,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the landscaping will indeed change.

1487
02:24:20,453 --> 02:24:25,855
[SPEAKER_12]: just to conform with some of our landscaping requirements.

1488
02:24:26,035 --> 02:24:38,238
[SPEAKER_12]: But perhaps in your decision, you add in some guardrails of what would trigger needing to come back, whether it's the change in the height.

1489
02:24:38,278 --> 02:24:46,601
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't foresee the footprint or the height changing, but it would be maybe the parking and the landscaping.

1490
02:24:49,322 --> 02:24:53,304
[SPEAKER_19]: And we appreciate those comments and agree with them.

1491
02:24:53,464 --> 02:25:16,635
[SPEAKER_19]: If the board was so inclined, I think that the framework that Danielle just described might be to approve a three-story addition with a height of 50.5 feet and a car elevator that does not exceed the previously approved five-story height.

1492
02:25:17,728 --> 02:25:22,512
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty much the relief that we're looking for from table B, 5E.

1493
02:25:24,074 --> 02:25:25,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you agree with that, Danielle?

1494
02:25:29,018 --> 02:25:30,139
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a reasonable approach.

1495
02:25:30,459 --> 02:25:34,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I see the building commissioner has his hand raised through the chair.

1496
02:25:36,765 --> 02:25:37,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Building commissioner, go ahead.

1497
02:25:38,412 --> 02:25:43,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think what they're asking for is a very narrow set of conditions.

1498
02:25:43,435 --> 02:25:49,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I think as long as the board's decision focuses on those narrow, you're not really commenting on the site plan per se.

1499
02:25:50,118 --> 02:25:54,640
[SPEAKER_11]: You're simply giving the relief for the height and everything else belongs to the community development board.

1500
02:25:56,021 --> 02:26:00,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So just don't predicate it on a set of plans, predicate it on the height numbers.

1501
02:26:01,003 --> 02:26:02,164
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be fine, I think.

1502
02:26:09,159 --> 02:26:10,259
[SPEAKER_19]: And we would agree with that.

1503
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:13,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Commissioner.

1504
02:26:13,901 --> 02:26:16,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions for the applicant from the board?

1505
02:26:16,241 --> 02:26:26,084
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll open it up for public comment.

1506
02:26:26,264 --> 02:26:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: If a member of the public would like to speak on this item, please raise your hand on Zoom or wave if you're on screen.

1507
02:26:36,054 --> 02:26:42,575
[SPEAKER_06]: or send in an email to Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov that is in the chat.

1508
02:26:42,595 --> 02:27:00,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any hands raised.

1509
02:27:00,299 --> 02:27:01,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, do you have any emails?

1510
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.

1511
02:27:07,674 --> 02:27:08,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion.

1512
02:27:09,896 --> 02:27:13,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1513
02:27:13,478 --> 02:27:17,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I will second.

1514
02:27:19,102 --> 02:27:19,583

[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie Thompson.

1524
02:27:34,453 --> 02:27:34,513
Aye.

1525
02:27:37,393 --> 02:27:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: open for discussion.

1526
02:27:45,862 --> 02:27:46,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Mary.

1527
02:27:48,364 --> 02:27:59,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Would the raising of the height change the use or increase the use, aggregate the use from its existing plan?

1528
02:28:02,652 --> 02:28:07,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that issue being addressed by the Community Development Committee?

1529
02:28:08,973 --> 02:28:10,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Use would be addressed by the city people.

1530
02:28:11,754 --> 02:28:12,554
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

1531
02:28:14,154 --> 02:28:19,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Our concern is strictly the height, the need for a variance for the height of the building.

1532
02:28:22,275 --> 02:28:32,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Strictly because the original site, the original variance did include the site plan, so it was a little bit more restrictive than what we're considering right now.

1533
02:28:37,145 --> 02:28:37,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, go ahead.

1534
02:28:38,746 --> 02:29:05,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this board had a different membership in 2001, but it found that building with a different use of the same height met the variance standard and the associated expectation to associate that with a hardship related to the shape topography or soil conditions of the lot.

1535
02:29:06,507 --> 02:29:32,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we consider that jointly with now there's a structure here that would present additional hardships if the board were to change its position on the matter, I think it's pretty straightforward that it would be a hardship if the board were not to amend

1536
02:29:34,063 --> 02:29:35,084
[SPEAKER_02]: the prior variance.

1537
02:29:36,104 --> 02:29:43,728
[SPEAKER_02]: The standards the same, but I procedurally I'm in favor of amending the prior variance rather than granting a fresh one here.

1538
02:29:43,868 --> 02:29:52,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah, it seems like a nice project and an upgrade and a big investment in the city of Medford.

1539
02:29:53,612 --> 02:29:59,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Community Development Board is gonna review the plan in great detail and

1540
02:30:01,135 --> 02:30:02,836
[SPEAKER_02]: may propose some modifications.

1541
02:30:03,216 --> 02:30:27,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the question at issue here, increasing the size of one of the buildings to well below the max height of the variance in a commercial district and making a big investment in the property for this use, I think is perfectly reasonable.

1542
02:30:27,587 --> 02:30:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing any

1543
02:30:31,115 --> 02:30:38,421
[SPEAKER_02]: detriment to the public good and in us being willing to amend the variance here.

1544
02:30:43,285 --> 02:30:43,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

1545
02:30:46,468 --> 02:30:47,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else from the board?

1546
02:30:49,630 --> 02:30:50,871
[SPEAKER_15]: I concur with what Mike said.

1547
02:30:53,753 --> 02:30:54,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Andre.

1548
02:30:59,138 --> 02:30:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,

1549
02:31:00,090 --> 02:31:04,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree as well, and I'm along the same lines of amending the existing variance.

1550
02:31:04,673 --> 02:31:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is the right direction to take this one.

1551
02:31:18,301 --> 02:31:23,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Just on the language for the existing variance, I believe.

1552
02:31:32,378 --> 02:31:34,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I can tackle it.

1553
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:39,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I am pulling some language from the project narrative.

1554
02:31:39,881 --> 02:31:51,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to motion to amend the 2001 height variance to reflect that

1555
02:32:04,744 --> 02:32:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: The max height remains the same.

1556
02:32:10,789 --> 02:32:32,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that 73.6 feet, provided that the resulting project involves a renovation of the existing five-story southerly building section.

1557
02:32:33,747 --> 02:33:02,205
[SPEAKER_02]: demolishing the older three-story section and constructing a new three-story section with height no more than 50.5 feet, and constructing a car elevator connecting the two sections

1558
02:33:05,133 --> 02:33:33,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so just to reiterate, the amendment will require that the max height is unchanged and that it involves a renovation of the existing five-story building, demolishing the older three-story building, reconstructing a new building no higher than 50.5, and connecting the two structures via a car elevator.

1559
02:33:36,110 --> 02:33:37,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my proposed.

1560
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:38,151
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.

1561
02:33:38,591 --> 02:33:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also propose we remove any language from the existing variants that would otherwise prohibit constructing the project as proposed in this narrative.

1562
02:34:04,099 --> 02:34:04,639
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a second.

1563
02:34:06,790 --> 02:34:07,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1564
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:12,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mary.

1565
02:34:15,612 --> 02:34:16,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the roof?

1566
02:34:17,512 --> 02:34:17,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1567
02:34:18,632 --> 02:34:19,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Lee?

1568
02:34:21,153 --> 02:34:21,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1569
02:34:22,673 --> 02:34:23,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Caldera?

1570
02:34:23,973 --> 02:34:24,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1571
02:34:25,054 --> 02:34:25,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette Velez?

1572
02:34:26,914 --> 02:34:27,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1573
02:34:28,094 --> 02:34:29,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie Thompson?

1574
02:34:29,034 --> 02:34:29,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1575
02:34:31,735 --> 02:34:32,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1576
02:34:33,531 --> 02:34:36,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you attorney marinelli if you could draft that for us.

1577
02:34:37,472 --> 02:34:39,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you I will do that.

1578
02:34:43,494 --> 02:34:44,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, but if you're telling.

1579
02:34:46,014 --> 02:34:49,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis could you move us on to the next case.

1580
02:34:49,856 --> 02:34:53,717
[SPEAKER_04]: 110 Norwich circle case number a dash 2024 dash 14.

1581
02:34:55,961 --> 02:35:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owner, Chanel and Frankie Stephanopoulos, are petitioning for a variance to add an addition to an existing structure at 110 Norwich Circle, which removed one existing parking space, giving the property one parking space, thereby requiring a variance, and it's sitting at the zoning ordinance, chapter 94, section 6.1.

1582
02:35:14,592 --> 02:35:15,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

1583
02:35:15,093 --> 02:35:16,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1584
02:35:23,518 --> 02:35:25,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure if it's Mr. Landry or not.

1585
02:35:26,939 --> 02:35:27,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Landry.

1586
02:35:29,881 --> 02:35:30,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, good evening.

1587
02:35:31,843 --> 02:35:32,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1588
02:35:32,103 --> 02:35:32,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1589
02:35:32,523 --> 02:35:35,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for allowing me to share my screen.

1590
02:35:36,386 --> 02:35:42,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Nick Landry from DRT.

1591
02:35:42,871 --> 02:35:50,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here tonight with the applicants, Chanel and Frankie Stav for 110 Norwich Circle.

1592
02:35:50,117 --> 02:35:53,520
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can share my screen.

1593
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's late, so I'll try to be very quick here.

1594
02:35:58,102 --> 02:36:01,324
[SPEAKER_10]: No worries, take your time.

1595
02:36:01,684 --> 02:36:05,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're proposing an addition to the house.

1596
02:36:06,166 --> 02:36:09,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankie and Chanel have lived here for quite a while, and they have a growing family.

1597
02:36:09,748 --> 02:36:18,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And in order to provide room for that family, we're proposing to extend the house kind of into the current parking area.

1598
02:36:18,873 --> 02:36:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: And what that'll do is it's going to reduce the number of parking spots from two to one.

1599
02:36:23,855 --> 02:36:26,797
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're here tonight to ask for relief for that.

1600
02:36:28,970 --> 02:36:35,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So, today, this is a site plan showing the existing houses Norwich circle in the front here.

1601
02:36:35,479 --> 02:36:41,687
[SPEAKER_10]: There's about a 29 foot setback and the house starts here and there's a lot lot deck in the rear yard.

1602
02:36:41,847 --> 02:36:43,550
[SPEAKER_10]: The driveways actually right here.

1603
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:45,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not shown on the existing plan, but it is in the proposed.

1604
02:36:49,217 --> 02:36:54,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So the currently there's about an 11 foot wide driveway with a curb cut that we plan to keep.

1605
02:36:54,743 --> 02:36:55,624
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't be changing that.

1606
02:36:56,685 --> 02:37:07,095
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to be adding this addition here, which is still going to give us over 22 feet from that addition to the sidewalk to park one car.

1607
02:37:09,284 --> 02:37:21,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently the way the yard is used by the family, they have a basketball hoop set up in the front of the yard and a grill and kind of an outdoor dining area set up in the rear portion of this.

1608
02:37:21,628 --> 02:37:32,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So currently they usually end up with one car on the street and then one car in the same spot that we're proposing to park it in our proposed option with this addition.

1609
02:37:32,291 --> 02:37:38,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And that outdoor space will now be on a porch in the front of the house here, both of which within the setbacks.

1610
02:37:42,255 --> 02:37:45,517
[SPEAKER_10]: just an overhead view of 110 Norwich.

1611
02:37:46,117 --> 02:37:48,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is Norwich Circle here coming around.

1612
02:37:49,139 --> 02:37:53,842
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see the driveway today.

1613
02:37:53,902 --> 02:37:55,743
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a basketball hoop that's set up right there.

1614
02:37:55,983 --> 02:37:58,825
[SPEAKER_10]: There's normally a car parked in front of this and then usually one on the street.

1615
02:38:02,963 --> 02:38:09,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So view today, so you can see the house here with the basketball hoop and the car that's typically parked here.

1616
02:38:09,749 --> 02:38:15,433
[SPEAKER_10]: The addition will still accommodate that same amount of parking for one car in the driveway.

1617
02:38:19,917 --> 02:38:23,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's about all we have here.

1618
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,502
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any questions, I could look back through.

1619
02:38:32,738 --> 02:38:33,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Landry.

1620
02:38:33,918 --> 02:38:36,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the board for Mr. Landry?

1621
02:38:47,542 --> 02:38:48,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this is Andre.

1622
02:38:48,782 --> 02:38:50,582
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question.

1623
02:38:51,163 --> 02:38:58,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just looking at the porch and the new front of the house is extending forward.

1624
02:38:58,444 --> 02:39:01,005
[SPEAKER_15]: So no variance required for that.

1625
02:39:02,502 --> 02:39:07,046
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, that, so the porch is within the setbacks.

1626
02:39:07,786 --> 02:39:09,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So no variance for the porch.

1627
02:39:10,509 --> 02:39:16,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still, I think it's roughly 20, 22 and a half feet off the front.

1628
02:39:18,115 --> 02:39:18,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

1629
02:39:27,703 --> 02:39:28,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the board?

1630
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:36,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems like currently there's two cars for the household.

1631
02:39:36,282 --> 02:39:41,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you anticipate an increase of cars for any time in the future?

1632
02:39:44,088 --> 02:39:45,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1633
02:39:45,348 --> 02:39:46,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

1634
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:48,791
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids are very young.

1635
02:39:49,711 --> 02:39:56,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the homeowner is raising his hand right now, if someone could allow him to speak.

1636
02:40:00,025 --> 02:40:01,887
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, uh, this is Frank Stavropoulos.

1637
02:40:02,087 --> 02:40:04,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, no, we don't anticipate an increase in cars at this time.

1638
02:40:10,114 --> 02:40:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Stavropoulos.

1639
02:40:13,437 --> 02:40:14,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Chair, just 1 more question.

1640
02:40:16,295 --> 02:40:33,315
[SPEAKER_15]: For the applicant, I'm wondering if the applicant could just characterize the, I know we got some butters support letters, but I'm wondering if the applicant could characterize the engagement with the surrounding of butters and what those conversations are like and where the support's coming from.

1641
02:40:34,767 --> 02:40:35,147
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, yeah.

1642
02:40:35,768 --> 02:40:36,388
[SPEAKER_23]: Am I still alive?

1643
02:40:36,548 --> 02:40:36,809
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

1644
02:40:37,609 --> 02:40:46,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, spoke to most of the butters people across the street that could potentially be affected by street parking, uh, as well as surrounding neighbors.

1645
02:40:47,075 --> 02:40:53,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, and as far as parking is concerned, there seems not to be much concern there.

1646
02:40:59,343 --> 02:41:00,064
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that adequate?

1647
02:41:00,124 --> 02:41:01,925
[SPEAKER_23]: Or were you looking for something more?

1648
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:05,620
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's fine.

1649
02:41:11,984 --> 02:41:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I do just want to double check specifically about my understanding is one of the letters of support the board received was from the butter directly to the right of this addition.

1650
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:33,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So the essentially the house closest to the to the addition as stated there in favor of

1651
02:41:34,468 --> 02:41:36,848
[SPEAKER_24]: further that they support the proposal, is that correct?

1652
02:41:37,909 --> 02:41:38,569
[SPEAKER_23]: That is correct.

1653
02:41:39,309 --> 02:41:40,389
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's what we're looking at.

1654
02:41:40,409 --> 02:41:41,429
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1655
02:41:41,809 --> 02:41:43,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1656
02:41:43,390 --> 02:41:49,091
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one from both the left and right side, correct, Frankie?

1657
02:41:49,891 --> 02:41:50,111
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1658
02:41:57,252 --> 02:41:57,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1659
02:41:57,832 --> 02:41:58,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw Mary.

1660
02:41:58,732 --> 02:42:02,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

1661
02:42:03,792 --> 02:42:09,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, I had a quick question, and it's really possibly not relevant.

1662
02:42:10,098 --> 02:42:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1663
02:42:11,599 --> 02:42:27,013
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like there's another means of egress on the driveway side, and it's not shown on the rendering here, but does it materially affect anything?

1664
02:42:28,116 --> 02:42:33,454
[SPEAKER_03]: of the way people would leave the house and use that side setback.

1665
02:42:38,887 --> 02:42:44,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think with the way, so you may notice here, the front entry here has shifted a little bit.

1666
02:42:45,931 --> 02:42:47,592
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of reworked the entry.

1667
02:42:47,972 --> 02:42:49,673
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be the main entrance.

1668
02:42:49,753 --> 02:42:53,995
[SPEAKER_10]: This side door that is going away, there's additional egress on the rear of the property.

1669
02:42:54,735 --> 02:43:07,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wouldn't be a building code, any building code issues there, and there wouldn't be any, there aren't any new openings or doors proposed on this facade that would be spilling over into the side yard.

1670
02:43:39,768 --> 02:43:43,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Chair, motion to open a public hearing portion.

1671
02:43:43,411 --> 02:43:48,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you're muted, Jamie.

1672
02:43:50,677 --> 02:43:51,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1673
02:43:52,939 --> 02:43:56,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're moving forward with a public comment.

1674
02:43:56,563 --> 02:43:58,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we don't need a motion anymore, thank you.

1675
02:43:59,265 --> 02:44:04,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So public comment, anyone from the public that wishes to speak, raise your hand on Zoom.

1676
02:44:05,744 --> 02:44:10,767
[SPEAKER_06]: or send an email in to Dennis at dmackdougal at medford-ma.gov.

1677
02:44:10,787 --> 02:44:16,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Give that a moment.

1678
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:34,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, do you have any emails or did you receive anything else

1679
02:44:35,999 --> 02:44:40,821
[SPEAKER_04]: No, aside from the letters of support that I submitted to all earlier.

1680
02:44:40,841 --> 02:44:42,822
[SPEAKER_04]: No emails tonight.

1681
02:44:43,963 --> 02:44:44,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

1682
02:44:44,643 --> 02:44:45,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1683
02:44:45,904 --> 02:44:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to close public comment.

1684
02:44:49,305 --> 02:44:52,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I motion to close public comment.

1685
02:44:52,507 --> 02:44:55,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second?

1686
02:44:56,249 --> 02:44:56,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1687
02:44:57,789 --> 02:44:58,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mary.

1688
02:44:58,530 --> 02:45:00,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Senator LaRue?

1689
02:45:02,171 --> 02:45:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1690
02:45:03,712 --> 02:45:04,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Lee?

1691
02:45:05,493 --> 02:45:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1692
02:45:06,465 --> 02:45:09,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael there.

1693
02:45:10,388 --> 02:45:12,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I. And Jamie Thompson.

1694
02:45:15,832 --> 02:45:16,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thoughts on this project.

1695
02:45:27,740 --> 02:45:30,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I think it's a.

1696
02:45:35,824 --> 02:45:36,444
[SPEAKER_02]: addition.

1697
02:45:36,805 --> 02:45:40,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's requiring fairly minimal relief here.

1698
02:45:41,987 --> 02:45:43,908
[SPEAKER_02]: The neighbors are supportive.

1699
02:45:44,869 --> 02:45:59,057
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardship that requires a variance here is the position of the existing structure and parking spaces relative to the lot.

1700
02:45:59,317 --> 02:46:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It really limits the options to extend within the

1701
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:09,442
[SPEAKER_02]: setbacks and retain two parking spaces.

1702
02:46:09,602 --> 02:46:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the only real option to add to the property while otherwise respecting those setbacks was to expand into the existing parking area, which is currently not used.

1703
02:46:28,412 --> 02:46:34,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a private street, doesn't appear to be heavily utilized for street parking.

1704
02:46:35,396 --> 02:46:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, the current resident parks on the street now anyway.

1705
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:47,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in terms of detriment to the public good, there really isn't a material detriment here.

1706
02:46:47,408 --> 02:46:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those are my thoughts.

1707
02:46:53,995 --> 02:46:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.

1708
02:46:56,577 --> 02:46:57,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Andre.

1709
02:47:06,625 --> 02:47:06,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

1710
02:47:08,887 --> 02:47:11,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Agree with the same with the letters of support from the neighbors.

1711
02:47:11,829 --> 02:47:22,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously losing parking is always a concern, but for the neighborhood having that much support and obviously considering that existing use, I think this is a good project.

1712
02:47:29,321 --> 02:47:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1713
02:47:35,765 --> 02:47:37,987
[SPEAKER_02]: for parking for 110 Norwich.

1714
02:47:40,549 --> 02:47:40,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

1715
02:47:42,150 --> 02:47:42,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mary.

1716
02:47:43,831 --> 02:47:44,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1717
02:47:45,372 --> 02:47:46,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, roll call.

1718
02:47:47,634 --> 02:47:48,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette Deleuze?

1719
02:47:49,876 --> 02:47:49,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1720
02:47:51,176 --> 02:47:51,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre LaRue?

1721
02:47:52,357 --> 02:47:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1722
02:47:53,598 --> 02:47:54,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Lee?

1723
02:47:54,119 --> 02:47:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1724
02:47:56,540 --> 02:47:57,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Caldera?

1725
02:47:57,841 --> 02:47:57,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1726
02:47:59,022 --> 02:47:59,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie Thompson?

1727
02:47:59,743 --> 02:47:59,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1728
02:48:08,557 --> 02:48:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, Dennis, could you guys work together?

1729
02:48:12,359 --> 02:48:14,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we don't have an attorney on this one.

1730
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:19,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So can we work together to draft the move?

1731
02:48:21,824 --> 02:48:22,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1732
02:48:22,224 --> 02:48:22,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1733
02:48:23,985 --> 02:48:26,846
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd be happy to try to draft something.

1734
02:48:29,327 --> 02:48:31,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can probably get the help of an attorney if we need to.

1735
02:48:32,009 --> 02:48:32,049
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1736
02:48:34,550 --> 02:48:34,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1737
02:48:36,431 --> 02:48:39,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis will connect with you on moving that forward.

1738
02:48:40,874 --> 02:48:47,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I might actually have some sort of similar cases that might sort of be a good sort of guide to start with.

1739
02:48:47,719 --> 02:48:50,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that you sort of use with like a boilerplate to sort of go from that.

1740
02:48:51,782 --> 02:48:54,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go back to our files for something recent that we've done.

1741
02:48:55,724 --> 02:48:56,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1742
02:48:56,685 --> 02:48:57,446
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be amazing.

1743
02:49:01,789 --> 02:49:03,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll shoot an email off to you tomorrow morning.

1744
02:49:05,793 --> 02:49:06,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Hunt, go ahead.

1745
02:49:07,374 --> 02:49:15,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, before they leave, I didn't hear you actually also approve the variance for front yard parking that was in the denial letter.

1746
02:49:15,536 --> 02:49:28,659
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't want to throw a monkey wrench into this, but it was in the denial letter and I didn't want them to have to come back.

1747
02:49:33,421 --> 02:49:34,181
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may,

1748
02:49:34,815 --> 02:49:42,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Through you, Jamie, is that actually needed relief here?

1749
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:46,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it was one parking space that's now zero or?

1750
02:49:47,222 --> 02:49:52,085
[SPEAKER_22]: You're saying this parking space was already in the front yard?

1751
02:49:52,905 --> 02:49:53,145
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1752
02:49:53,305 --> 02:49:53,645
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1753
02:49:53,926 --> 02:49:54,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1754
02:49:54,426 --> 02:49:54,726
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1755
02:49:57,908 --> 02:50:01,710
[SPEAKER_22]: I just figured it was better to not let the applicant go away.

1756
02:50:02,992 --> 02:50:07,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the change is a reduction of parking, but I see what you mean in the language and the denial.

1757
02:50:08,557 --> 02:50:12,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was actually pretty similar to the one we had a few months ago on Lincoln street where.

1758
02:50:13,842 --> 02:50:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: The applicant closed off her garage and that basically forced her parking space, which to be that was in the front yard setback.

1759
02:50:20,288 --> 02:50:21,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did something similar to that.

1760
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some.

1761
02:50:37,261 --> 02:50:40,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess the language in the denial continues.

1762
02:50:40,903 --> 02:50:47,028
[SPEAKER_06]: As such, you must seek to a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals to allow a single non-conforming parking space to meet the requirements.

1763
02:50:54,093 --> 02:50:55,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any attorneys on?

1764
02:50:59,077 --> 02:50:59,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle?

1765
02:50:59,678 --> 02:51:02,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1766
02:51:03,475 --> 02:51:11,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it wasn't front yard initially, but once you add the addition, it becomes in front of the front yard.

1767
02:51:12,321 --> 02:51:21,547
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was a garage addition, then it wouldn't be, but because it's living space, it's kind of like a particularity.

1768
02:51:24,854 --> 02:51:25,855
[SPEAKER_12]: an issue with it.

1769
02:51:25,875 --> 02:51:35,700
[SPEAKER_12]: The applicant explored flaring it out to try to get two spaces there, but then they introduced other variances who were trading one for another.

1770
02:51:35,720 --> 02:51:40,523
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was the layout that didn't have

1771
02:51:41,603 --> 02:51:58,077
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't increase impervious surface, so it felt like it didn't create the detriment that putting more pavement to put in a parking space in another location just to be, you know, by the book.

1772
02:51:59,238 --> 02:52:03,622
[SPEAKER_12]: It just seemed like it would not be the best scenario.

1773
02:52:06,164 --> 02:52:06,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1774
02:52:08,927 --> 02:52:09,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner?

1775
02:52:10,409 --> 02:52:26,963
[SPEAKER_11]: The intent was to recognize that they essentially had a conforming spot and a nonconforming spot, and that by granting the variance, they would be left behind with a nonconforming spot and just recognize that it didn't require relief.

1776
02:52:27,063 --> 02:52:34,509
[SPEAKER_11]: It was more to recognize that you were still going to have one, but just happens to be nonconforming because the front yard.

1777
02:52:38,382 --> 02:52:48,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, would that mean that the recommend that the vote should be to allow one nonconforming spot, not just to allow one spot?

1778
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:54,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I suppose that's probably a more accurate description of it to clarify what it is.

1779
02:52:54,372 --> 02:52:59,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So you don't accidentally create conformity to it in some way and create an unintended consequence.

1780
02:53:00,196 --> 02:53:00,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1781
02:53:00,576 --> 02:53:03,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I'm not arguing against the approval.

1782
02:53:03,317 --> 02:53:04,678
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm completely in favor of that.

1783
02:53:05,179 --> 02:53:07,360
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want it to be correct.

1784
02:53:11,663 --> 02:53:13,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so can we amend?

1785
02:53:14,144 --> 02:53:14,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1786
02:53:14,365 --> 02:53:17,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was I was a bit ambiguous in the wording of my motion.

1787
02:53:17,987 --> 02:53:20,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just said the parking variance.

1788
02:53:20,289 --> 02:53:24,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I now understand it, it's what Scott said.

1789
02:53:24,572 --> 02:53:31,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, if we need to amend it and revote, I think the decision could just reflect that.

1790
02:53:33,278 --> 02:53:36,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why don't why don't we do so just to avoid any legal issues?

1791
02:53:38,423 --> 02:54:02,461
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then I will motion to amend the prior approval to clarify that we are approving a parking variance to allow for a reduction down to one non-conforming parking space in the front yard.

1792
02:54:11,092 --> 02:54:12,193
[SPEAKER_06]: 2nd, thank you.

1793
02:54:12,213 --> 02:54:13,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary under.

1794
02:54:14,654 --> 02:54:17,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mike.

1795
02:54:18,597 --> 02:54:21,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mary.

1796
02:54:22,099 --> 02:54:23,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, and Jamie.

1797
02:54:25,321 --> 02:54:25,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1798
02:54:26,662 --> 02:54:27,462
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still go forward.

1799
02:54:32,485 --> 02:54:33,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time.

1800
02:54:33,486 --> 02:54:35,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate your patience with this this evening.

1801
02:54:36,641 --> 02:54:42,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all and thank you all for confirming that we've got the right variance.

1802
02:54:42,464 --> 02:54:43,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1803
02:54:44,224 --> 02:54:45,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a great night.

1804
02:54:47,666 --> 02:54:49,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Administrative updates.

1805
02:54:50,447 --> 02:54:52,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have anything on the city side?

1806
02:55:01,411 --> 02:55:18,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure you're all aware that the first round of zoning changes has been legally referred from the city council to the CD board, which will be hearing them in their public hearing next week.

1807
02:55:21,346 --> 02:55:24,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Danielle is sending packets to the CD board tomorrow.

1808
02:55:25,617 --> 02:55:29,978
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to grab, I'd like to just grab them and send them all to you.

1809
02:55:30,018 --> 02:55:33,839
[SPEAKER_22]: You're welcome to provide any comments to the CD board for consideration.

1810
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:47,263
[SPEAKER_22]: It's mostly some cosmetic changes and then adding in some definitions and then changing how zoning meets municipally owned property.

1811
02:55:49,924 --> 02:55:53,725
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's a very, very brief summary, but I feel that it

1812
02:55:54,162 --> 02:56:07,650
[SPEAKER_22]: If anybody looks at the changes proposed, sending us comments before the CD board would really be the easiest and best way to impact them.

1813
02:56:07,971 --> 02:56:11,673
[SPEAKER_22]: Please don't wait until they're in front of the city council for the final vote.

1814
02:56:12,093 --> 02:56:20,799
[SPEAKER_22]: That can raise logistical nightmare questions as to whether it then has to be sent out.

1815
02:56:27,834 --> 02:56:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those packets available at the office?

1816
02:56:29,314 --> 02:56:33,196
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all electronic.

1817
02:56:34,076 --> 02:56:34,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

1818
02:56:35,296 --> 02:56:46,399
[SPEAKER_22]: But what it is, is in the city council agenda from this past Tuesday night, if you haven't explored their new agendas, they do attach papers for all the agenda items.

1819
02:56:47,019 --> 02:56:48,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, so it's the same ones that we just voted on?

1820
02:56:49,750 --> 02:56:53,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I would download them from the City Council Agenda and hit forward on them.

1821
02:56:54,351 --> 02:57:00,493
[SPEAKER_22]: If you wanted to just go to the Council Agenda, those are in fact the documents that are going to the CD board.

1822
02:57:00,513 --> 02:57:00,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1823
02:57:01,273 --> 02:57:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was an additional set going to the CD board.

1824
02:57:04,273 --> 02:57:04,373
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1825
02:57:04,614 --> 02:57:08,114
[SPEAKER_22]: It's what was on the Council Agenda on Tuesday.

1826
02:57:08,935 --> 02:57:11,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got too many documents and links in my life.

1827
02:57:12,155 --> 02:57:15,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to remove any and all ambiguity.

1828
02:57:15,316 --> 02:57:17,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Could someone send a link?

1829
02:57:17,957 --> 02:57:18,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send it over to you.

1830
02:57:19,782 --> 02:57:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1831
02:57:21,003 --> 02:57:24,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to review and provide comments in a timely fashion.

1832
02:57:24,826 --> 02:57:26,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure I'm doing it on the right.

1833
02:57:27,308 --> 02:57:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I actually just sent them to a couple of people earlier today.

1834
02:57:35,855 --> 02:57:37,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner, do you still have your hand up?

1835
02:57:41,119 --> 02:57:41,719
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

1836
02:57:41,739 --> 02:57:43,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to put the little button down.

1837
02:57:47,744 --> 02:57:48,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other updates from the city side?

1838
02:57:51,014 --> 02:57:52,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we have any minutes?

1839
02:57:52,654 --> 02:57:54,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we've got any minutes.

1840
02:57:54,635 --> 02:58:01,916
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but in talking with Teresa earlier today, she said she found some, because right now the Zoom provides like a full transcript of everything.

1841
02:58:01,936 --> 02:58:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And she found some software that she can use to make at least a rough draft of the minutes from that.

1842
02:58:08,017 --> 02:58:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to work with her tomorrow on that.

1843
02:58:12,138 --> 02:58:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should expedite matters greatly.

1844
02:58:14,419 --> 02:58:18,740
[SPEAKER_04]: She said it's made a massive difference for her with the expedited preservation.

1845
02:58:23,900 --> 02:58:27,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was always 3rd party tools, but Windsor matted it built in it.

1846
02:58:27,641 --> 02:58:28,342
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big help.

1847
02:58:29,322 --> 02:58:34,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

1848
02:58:34,264 --> 02:58:37,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody have any new items?

1849
02:58:38,966 --> 02:58:41,147
[SPEAKER_24]: I will motion to adjourn.

1850
02:58:42,127 --> 02:58:42,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1851
02:58:43,167 --> 02:58:45,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded and roll call.

1852
02:58:47,009 --> 02:58:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Andre.

1853
02:58:47,309 --> 02:58:48,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Mary.

1854
02:58:53,790 --> 02:59:04,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I, Chris, I, Mike, I, and Jamie I, ten minutes later than we thought.

1855
02:59:04,297 --> 02:59:04,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1856
02:59:05,218 --> 02:59:06,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, really quick.

1857
02:59:06,359 --> 02:59:08,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not gonna be in the next meeting.

1858
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:10,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on vacation.

1859
02:59:10,642 --> 02:59:13,684
[SPEAKER_08]: The end of the month is everybody.

1860
02:59:13,704 --> 02:59:13,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1861
02:59:15,105 --> 02:59:15,545
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's going.

1862
02:59:17,597 --> 02:59:23,622
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so it won't be so that won't affect the 280 mystic because that's continued to July.

1863
02:59:23,642 --> 02:59:29,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no.

1864
02:59:31,169 --> 02:59:32,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great vacation.

1865
02:59:32,089 --> 02:59:34,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks much.

1866
02:59:35,112 --> 02:59:35,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Have a good 1 night.

1867
02:59:35,852 --> 02:59:36,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody.
