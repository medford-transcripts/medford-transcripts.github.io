1
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:26,489
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy Dylan Zahn uses similar bags for his congas.

2
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:52,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old school technique of Army, Navy duffel bags.

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot cheaper than proper cases.

4
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Proper cases.

5
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why don't you make it hot?

6
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me the case here and I'll take it to the gear dump.

7
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:04,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got it.

8
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to call it intermission because it puts the wrong idea in people's heads.

9
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:24,059
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we do a little break.

10
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep everybody in the house.

11
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:36,647
[SPEAKER_00]: We stream to YouTube, and then we do broadcasts on local programs.

12
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,328
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he does it all.

13
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,428
That's right.

14
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:39,328
I like it.

15
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,189
I love it.

16
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,589
Everything is right now.

17
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming in.

18
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,351
I'm coming to set these.

19
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,311
Are you a musician?

20
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a big star.

21
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:50,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my soda.

22
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:52,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Drink a break.

23
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:54,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so I need it.

24
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:14,065
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big one.

25
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working.

26
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:02,188
I know.

27
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.

28
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:46,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see it.

29
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,928
Give them a count from maybe 1 to 10.

30
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:22,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Check, check.

31
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:24,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Too loud?

32
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,135
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

33
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:26,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

34
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Check, check, check, check, check, check, check.

35
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Good?

36
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:31,641
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

37
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,323
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

38
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:35,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

39
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

40
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:11,121
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

41
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:18,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another evening of Fresh Fridays, Words and Music, our third of this program year.

42
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:28,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We are up and running with our rebrand and happy to be bringing you this noteworthy program of community conversation and great musical entertainment.

43
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:38,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are on the move at 111 Arlington Street.

44
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:50,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to remind you that COVID and RSV and the flu are real, and we are still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

45
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So masking is welcomed, but not required.

46
00:10:53,094 --> 00:11:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just really happy to be sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC and glad to see our neighbors, friends, and supporters coming in from the cold.

47
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:05,718
[SPEAKER_02]: and through those doors.

48
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for being here tonight.

49
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:23,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks also to Kevin Harrington and Mark Davidson from Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast you via Medford Community Media, channels 3 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

50
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:32,006
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're out there watching on your electronic devices or your television, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, welcome to the show.

51
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:40,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as many of you know, for the past two years ago, I had the honor of serving as Medford's inaugural Poet Laureate.

52
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Acting as the official city poet, my task was to highlight poets and poetry and literature, particularly working with community members who may traditionally have less access to poetry.

53
00:11:54,278 --> 00:12:04,705
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the city's administration and Medford Arts Council, I believe I was able to increase this access to diverse local communities across various platforms.

54
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:16,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Needless to say, it was a new and unique opportunity for me to expand the city's recognition of and appreciation for poetry as an art form worthy of celebrating.

55
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:21,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my tenure as the city's first poet in chief ended on June 30th in 2023.

56
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:30,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the pleasure of officially passing the baton to Medford's second ever Poet Laureate.

57
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:39,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as she approaches the last quarter of her own appointment, let me reintroduce her to this community and to the greater city.

58
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:47,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Vijaya Sundaram is a native of northern India, who has been a resident... Southern India, I got it wrong twice.

59
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, who has been a resident of Medford for close to 20 years.

60
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, more than 20 years.

61
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:01,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Vijaya lives in Medford's other west, we call it, Felsway West.

62
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,958
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a truly creative spirit.

63
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an accomplished poet and a literary lioness.

64
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear a growl.

65
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:10,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

66
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:18,928
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also a songwriter, a singer, and an assistant professor in the English and Humanities Department at Bunker Hill Community College.

67
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:27,495
[SPEAKER_02]: She is in the middle of the end of the semester craziness, grading papers and all of that stuff.

68
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to be able to keep her forever, but she's here right now.

69
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:41,344
[SPEAKER_02]: She has also been a traditional and homeschooling elementary grades teacher, as well as a poetry and literature professor.

70
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:55,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Her written work has appeared in publications like the Rising Phoenix Press and the Stardust Review, and in late 2023, her first full collection of poetry, Fractured Lens, let us show it to you,

71
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:01,012
[SPEAKER_02]: was released by Somerville's Sylvania Bava Press.

72
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:06,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It has received great acclaim and is a cherished volume in my own poetry collection.

73
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to have it for your poetry collection, Vijay has some copies over there that you can purchase.

74
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've known Vijaya for close to four years now, and we've worked together on a few occasions, and I've been blessed by her association and her allyship.

75
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:26,352
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a poet of great power and clarity.

76
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: There is substance and

77
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: rhythm and style and nuance and depth to her writing.

78
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:43,023
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a progressive thinker and understands social justice, prejudice, and systemic inequity from both a personal and an intellectual perspective.

79
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:46,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we are kindred spirits.

80
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:57,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my honor and my pleasure to bring back my good friend and poetry peer Vijaya Sundaram to Fresh Fridays at the West Medford Community Center.

81
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Please give her a little bit of love.

82
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:01,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

83
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

84
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:03,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

85
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:03,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

86
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to forego my usual custom of reading a poem to open these monthly proceedings, but we will both be sharing several pieces as part of our conversation.

87
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,513
[SPEAKER_02]: With that in mind, let's have a friendly chat with my friend Vijaya Sundaram.

88
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So Vijaya, I'm going to start out like this.

89
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:26,637
[SPEAKER_02]: As Medford's second ever Poet Laureate, how goes it?

90
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,430
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty hectic.

91
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I have enjoyed it.

92
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:36,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not one of those things where you can sit back and relax and say, oh, now I've got it.

93
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do anything.

94
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:42,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been asked to read at various events.

95
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And because I am who I am, I don't like to repeat myself.

96
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:53,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So I write the poem for the event while trying to stay true, not trying to, I stay true to my vision and my

97
00:15:54,976 --> 00:16:04,562
[SPEAKER_09]: but include the thing that they're asking about in such a way that it works aesthetically for me, as well as intellectually for me.

98
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:21,794
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been asked to read at various things, including the inauguration of our current mayor, Pride Festival, Haiti Flag Day, the CPAs, they had an event in the beginning where they celebrated what they'd achieved.

99
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:31,881
[SPEAKER_09]: the gala at the arts collaborative Medford, so a whole lot of things, which meant that I had to write for all of those things, and I really enjoyed doing it.

100
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It brought me great satisfaction, and I worked pretty hard on it.

101
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:45,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's been a lot of work, but apart from that, I've also started a poetry club at the Medford Public Library, because I take this mandate seriously.

102
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,132
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm to be poet laureate, I'm gonna try and bring it to the people of Medford.

103
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:56,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I just decided to do that as a sort of my gesture towards our city.

104
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:04,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And I recently began an open mic at the Arts Collaborative Medford.

105
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,078
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a beautiful, beautiful spot.

106
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:06,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

107
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So I call it open mic for poetry and original songs.

108
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,601
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not for bands to play, but if you're a duo or a trio, you can play.

109
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Duo is better than trio because it becomes too big.

110
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:23,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And yesterday we had our third open mic, and it's once a month.

111
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a really nice crowd.

112
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was surprised.

113
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like 20, 21 people.

114
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get over there.

115
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

116
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get you there.

117
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:32,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get you there.

118
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's part of what's been going on.

119
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,881
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been very busy, in fact.

120
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:41,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been trying to keep track of all the different things that you are doing.

121
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:45,668
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I wasn't sure that you'd be able to make time for this program.

122
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:50,912
[SPEAKER_02]: But your work really does speak for itself.

123
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to ask you, what's been, I mean, if you're able to say, what's been the best part of your tenure so far?

124
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:04,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I think getting to know people like you.

125
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:09,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Poets, as a poet, I was a pretty solitary kind of writer.

126
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not mingle with other poets.

127
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Poets are generally solitary creatures.

128
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:21,138
[SPEAKER_09]: We labor and toil in the dark, so to speak, and we write for ourselves, and we hope that somebody will find us.

129
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:25,480
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of diffident creatures, even though we might be outgoing in other ways.

130
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,601
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of like, oh, am I good enough?

131
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:28,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Who likes me?

132
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:33,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I found all other, I mean you brought me into the scene.

133
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And I discovered Julia Lizella through you and Max Heineck.

134
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:41,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I met other poets who've invited me to speak at various events.

135
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:44,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So I spoke at Arlington Public Library.

136
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Gene Flanagan's over in Arlington.

137
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:46,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Gene Flanagan.

138
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:50,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in Newton, Newton Free Library and also

139
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:53,829
[SPEAKER_09]: at the district, Somerville District Court.

140
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a nice card from the justice over there who heard me read a poem about diversity.

141
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like.

142
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:06,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious, you know, because the last thing that I really want to get is mail from the court.

143
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, right.

144
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:10,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, whoa, maybe if I get a speeding ticket, I'll go there.

145
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,341
[SPEAKER_02]: They could take care of it for you.

146
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:20,785
[SPEAKER_02]: What has surprised you most about the work that you've been doing in your capacity as poet laureate?

147
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know it would be this much work.

148
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought you become a laureate and then you read at a few events.

149
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,342
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been a lot of events.

150
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:31,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I even read the Martin Luther King.

151
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to include that.

152
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved that one, thank you.

153
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:40,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're doing Martin Luther King again this year, so we'll have to maybe chat a bit about that.

154
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that you love music as much as you love writing.

155
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:54,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had to put your music aside as you've been pursuing your poetry mantle for the city?

156
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:57,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I do music every night.

157
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:07,497
[SPEAKER_09]: My husband and I play guitar, and we sing some jazz standards, and we play a few Charlie Parker tunes, and we, you know, and then we do a little Lester Young here and there.

158
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.

159
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,397
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't with a guitar.

160
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:11,178
[SPEAKER_09]: We play their solos, and we have fun.

161
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just sort of keeping our hand in.

162
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:17,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not doing anything new musically, but I'm trying to not lose track of it.

163
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, the next stage would be to set my poems to music.

164
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm so busy working at college that I don't know when I can do it.

165
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:26,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the goal.

166
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm headed.

167
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:30,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a blast.

168
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:32,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that from experience.

169
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:38,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you had known about the work that I had done with Jonathan Fagan and the Ally Project.

170
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:52,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But going into the studio with good musicians and doing poetry while they play, and in your case, perhaps playing with them musically as well, it's a blast.

171
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:53,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

172
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so, you know, I hope you get to do that.

173
00:20:56,627 --> 00:21:00,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my friend Glenn Dixon and I are planning to do something together.

174
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We just haven't had a chance to get back.

175
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:04,092
[SPEAKER_09]: We performed here before.

176
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:04,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

177
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoyed playing with him.

178
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:07,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

179
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:09,316
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, Glenn is, whoo.

180
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:10,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely lovely.

181
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the ethereum, you know.

182
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:14,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good, very good.

183
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

184
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:23,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Has being the Poet Laureate at all informed the way you approach your teaching?

185
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,701
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.

186
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:28,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at all.

187
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:45,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was a teacher for longer than I've been a poet laureate and one of my students who attended my Porter Square reading books, I had a reading at Porter Square books this summer and she's a homeschool student of mine and she said the way you read

188
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:51,355
[SPEAKER_09]: and you shared your poetry reminds me of how you taught, which was the highest compliment that anyone could have given me.

189
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, thank you, that's what I needed.

190
00:21:53,315 --> 00:22:03,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it sounds real, and it's not like, oh, I'm making this up for this audience or that audience, it's all part of the same cut of cloth, then I will have achieved my goal.

191
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel nothing has changed in that sense.

192
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:07,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I'm older.

193
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:11,084
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had been in my 30s and had this, it might have changed me.

194
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm 60 years old this year, nothing can faze me.

195
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

196
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:18,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just there, I'm sorry, I'm just doing, thank you.

197
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:22,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the hood, we say black don't crack, right?

198
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:29,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And you with this beautiful collection of yours, you can come hang out with us anytime.

199
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:29,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

200
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,480
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so advice.

201
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:44,570
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice, having been the poet laureate, it's a beautiful thing, would you give to an aspiring poet who perhaps wants to publish and gain some more public recognition?

202
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So publishing is hard.

203
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:53,152
[SPEAKER_09]: By the time they appointed me as Poet Laureate, my book hadn't yet come out.

204
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:54,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out a month after that.

205
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me forever to get this.

206
00:22:57,555 --> 00:23:02,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the person publishing it is lovely, but she was backlogged because of COVID.

207
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So it took her four years to get to my book, which she had promised me, or three years, something like that.

208
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:09,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not exactly clear.

209
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I spoke to her in 2020 or 2021.

210
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:13,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally it came out.

211
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, not four or three, maybe two and a half.

212
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:16,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

213
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,148
[SPEAKER_09]: It took a long time.

214
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:22,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And now when I asked her again, she said she's backlogged again.

215
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't get published by her again.

216
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to look for another publisher.

217
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no money in this thing.

218
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:29,712
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no money in this thing.

219
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,156
[SPEAKER_09]: And nobody and the small presses are all pressed for time, so to speak.

220
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:39,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And so and people are beating down the doors trying to get published.

221
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes there's a glut of poetry and sometimes you say, OK, fine.

222
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,625
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a part of me that says, forget about it.

223
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:46,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go and keep writing.

224
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:48,408
[SPEAKER_09]: If people want you, they'll come to you.

225
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:53,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you gain a certain perspective when you get older.

226
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no hurry.

227
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:56,737
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing to prove to anybody.

228
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:57,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't.

229
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely right.

230
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen, I have six no monies going on seven.

231
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:03,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think

232
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:28,363
[SPEAKER_02]: and they call it vanity press for a reason, but I think that there's something in us that wants to see it on paper, wants to see it in print, and if people want to buy it, that's a beautiful thing, but we give ourselves a pass on that because we want to see it get done.

233
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:29,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So beautifully put.

234
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:30,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so true.

235
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:35,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You cast your bread upon the waters, as they say, and it comes back to you as something else.

236
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

237
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully as a muffin, you know.

238
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:42,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not burned toast.

239
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I did my two years for the city, I had a lot of folks help me do some things that I was able to do during my appointment.

240
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any particular folks, and I know that this is a dangerous thing to do, but do you have any particular folks that you want to give thanks or a public shout out to?

241
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:06,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, definitely.

242
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the mayor's office has been really kind to me.

243
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime I ask for something, they really help me out.

244
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:13,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, beautiful.

245
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:17,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So Steve Smurty and all the other folk over there, the good folk.

246
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:22,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to keep naming all the names because I might pronounce them incorrectly.

247
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:22,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Koliani.

248
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:24,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Lisa.

249
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:25,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa Koliani.

250
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:25,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

251
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:32,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also the ACM folks, so Gary Roberts and Regina Parkinson, they're wonderful.

252
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:35,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Medford Library, all of them actually.

253
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:37,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Barbara Kerr and Sam Sednick.

254
00:25:37,674 --> 00:25:40,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sam Sednick is awesome, and Barbara Kerr.

255
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:41,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank all of them.

256
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:43,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I want to thank you.

257
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:43,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

258
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:47,058
[SPEAKER_09]: You've always been helpful in promoting us all.

259
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And you included us in this sort of generous gesture when we first began.

260
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:57,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And you had that farmers market online thing that we did in 2021.

261
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wonderful thing.

262
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also in person.

263
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:03,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

264
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:15,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I knew that it was fully going to be your intention to kind of look at what I'd done and say, OK, well, what's the next move?

265
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,026
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next level?

266
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been appreciative of everything that you've done that kind of reflects on the fact that you kind of look at the plan and said, OK, that was good.

267
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:28,569
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.

268
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.

269
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.

270
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

271
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:45,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get finished with grading papers and kicking them out, what new initiatives are you excited about over the next several months of your tenure?

272
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:49,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yikes.

273
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just going to plug away at the two things that I'm doing.

274
00:26:53,582 --> 00:27:02,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping, I don't know if there's any, I'm just hoping to do something for poetry that I'm yet to unveil until I speak with the proper people.

275
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm planning to do something big for poetry.

276
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it comes out.

277
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:11,934
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well stay tuned everybody because Vijay is planning to do something big for poetry.

278
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:15,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like April-ish for National Poetry Month?

279
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:22,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, probably April-ish or maybe May because April is such a horrible month and so cruel and cold and windy and awful.

280
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, maybe April.

281
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what is it, T.S.

282
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Eliot, April is the cruelest month.

283
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruelest month, yes.

284
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:47,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so as you think about collaborations, and particularly youth poetry, in engaging more folks in the appreciation of the literary arts in Medford, what do you see as some potential challenges and some potential opportunities?

285
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am worried about, dare I say this, the political climate.

286
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:56,618
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not going to go there because everybody's listening in.

287
00:27:56,638 --> 00:28:02,143
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd rather make friends.

288
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:06,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope that people support the arts.

289
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:10,771
[SPEAKER_09]: The arts, a country without the arts is a dead country.

290
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:11,651
[SPEAKER_09]: The arts are

291
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:20,922
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the canaries in the coal mine, in a sense, but we are also the celebrators, we are the larks in the spring and so on and so forth, if we want to get the bird metaphor out.

292
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:27,069
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hope that they keep supporting poetry and music and art.

293
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,610
[SPEAKER_09]: The Arts Collaborative Medford, the space is gorgeous.

294
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:37,772
[SPEAKER_09]: They have so many paintings and sculptures and just lovely to go there and to do poetry over there.

295
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:42,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope our city continues to support us and I hope Massachusetts is good.

296
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really good place for the arts, I think.

297
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:47,214
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hope that the country gets behind it.

298
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:51,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope we poets speak up when we hear and see injustice.

299
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

300
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:53,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to speak up.

301
00:28:53,558 --> 00:29:02,384
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't cower behind, I don't know, some comfortable life that we have, saying, well, it doesn't affect me, so why should I care?

302
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:07,388
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does affect, what is it, what you do unto the smallest among them, you do unto me.

303
00:29:07,668 --> 00:29:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

304
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the least of my brothers.

305
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Martin Luther King said, he said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

306
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:15,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere, absolutely.

307
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so before we move to sharing some verse with the audience, you and I, I want to let you button up kind of this conversation part.

308
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: What other thoughts do you have that you might like to share?

309
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:34,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything in particular?

310
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:41,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everyone should explore their poetic and artistic selves.

311
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:48,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't tie yourself to some image of who you are or were and say that is not me.

312
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:51,094
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at something and say I wish I could do that, then try it.

313
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:55,836
[SPEAKER_09]: You wish you wanted to paint, go paint.

314
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,637
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wish you wanted to learn a guitar,

315
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:03,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't compare yourself to, I don't know, Les Paul or whoever, or Django Reinhardt.

316
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Just play guitar.

317
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,583
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be someone else.

318
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:07,784
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to do it.

319
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:08,464
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

320
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:09,665
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.

321
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:10,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

322
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take turns.

323
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:15,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to read a little bit of poetry.

324
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all right with everybody?

325
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:17,964
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, very good.

326
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:27,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So as my guest, obviously, I am going to give the floor to Vijaya first.

327
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:35,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And Vijaya, you read whatever your little heart, big heart actually, wants to do.

328
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:38,418
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

329
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:39,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course.

330
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me start with something joyful.

331
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:49,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote this on the 4th of December, which was two days ago.

332
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:54,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't usually write panegyrics or whatever about athletes.

333
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not my thing.

334
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:57,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not Pindar.

335
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone said, are you being Pindar?

336
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:00,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, no.

337
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:04,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But I saw a beautiful video of Olga Korbut.

338
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my goodness.

339
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:16,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember her from when I was a kid and I saw that leap, those leaps that she did and I saw it, it crossed my Facebook feed and I thought, wow, this is so beautiful.

340
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:21,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the first time I wrote about a person who is completely unconnected with my life.

341
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:22,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

342
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:27,698
[SPEAKER_09]: In that, in a sporty sense, athletic sense.

343
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's called Olga Korbut, not very imaginative title.

344
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:40,086
[SPEAKER_09]: That smile at the end, pure glee, a thumbing of the nose at gravity, at foolish notions of human limitations.

345
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:47,491
[SPEAKER_09]: A thumbing of the nose at serious folk jabbering away because that's all they could do then and that's all they can do now.

346
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:55,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Master of air, of creating air mazes in the space she occupied, creating current that buoyed her up.

347
00:31:56,036 --> 00:32:02,663
[SPEAKER_09]: She swung, and flipped, and balanced, and spun, and flipped backwards, and bounced off the horizontal bars.

348
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,586
[SPEAKER_09]: She was rubber, and it was nothing.

349
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:18,679
[SPEAKER_09]: She spun herself a vortex, swirling with energy, and crackling with electric power, within whose core sat sure force of Olga Will, silent, eyes closed, breathing in and out.

350
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:26,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting, not swirling and twirling and whirling and hurling herself against a too solid wall of air, daring it to hurt her.

351
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:33,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Then smiling, disarming everything with the sweetest, purest, childlike joy.

352
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

353
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:38,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We do like this.

354
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:45,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I looked her up, I was heartbroken to find out that she had the usual horrible story of Me Too with her coach.

355
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:50,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought, well, that smile she gave, that was her flipping him off.

356
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,831
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like, I will be great despite you.

357
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:55,772
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.

358
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

359
00:32:58,372 --> 00:32:58,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Where am I?

360
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is, this is for us.

361
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:07,602
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?

362
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So this piece is called Kill the Poets First.

363
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,106
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?

364
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:13,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take it literally.

365
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:13,987
[SPEAKER_02]: All right?

366
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:18,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody back there that got any, you know, just keep it to yourself.

367
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:25,315
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, kill the poets first, for they will tell the truth and shame the devil in all of us.

368
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:30,980
[SPEAKER_02]: They will highlight the lack of honor among thieves with assonance, alliteration, and clever metaphor.

369
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them in shackles and parade them through the public square.

370
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Strip them naked if you dare.

371
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:46,665
[SPEAKER_02]: They will expose the libertarian as the libertine amid the piles of gluttony, hubris, pride, and prejudice that lie at his outridden feet.

372
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:56,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They will rightly divide the gospel in ways that the jackleg and the profligate and the snake oil purveyor conflate, confuse, and contradict at every pulpit and podium.

373
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:10,275
[SPEAKER_02]: They will measure with meter the length of the bigot's bloodline, the strength of the captor's confine, the mark of the beastly revenant, the lies which prove most fraudulent the truth that they seek to circumvent.

374
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:25,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the poets first, for their lyrics, like fine opera, will peel away the lie and pare down the malice and point out the mayhem in rhyming couplets, piquant haiku, and epic odes, hip hop for the homeboys.

375
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:32,366
[SPEAKER_02]: with their Black Lives Matter and their Save the Planet and their No Justice, No Peace.

376
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:44,491
[SPEAKER_02]: They will roll the bedrocks of the right wing of the rabid racists and the reluctant witness back down the mountain we've scaled like a Sisyphus stone over and over and over again.

377
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:58,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the poets first, by the bullet in the ballot, by the garret and the glock and the guillotine in the gas chamber, by a thousand disappearing acts and a hundred hidden dungeons, by the noose from the bow of an ancient oak.

378
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:09,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is the ultimate attention getter, a foolproof message sender, greater in gore than any artist can render, crucifixion for the commoner and the crusader.

379
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no allegiance to the song.

380
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Vow not to the charming verses.

381
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:15,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Smile not at the fragrant lyric.

382
00:35:15,944 --> 00:35:20,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Hide not the pretty sonnet in the bowels of your heart of darkness.

383
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill them first.

384
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:23,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They will trick you.

385
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:28,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You will feel the pangs of your lost humanity welling up in your bosom.

386
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:35,633
[SPEAKER_02]: They will convict you, make you want to buy back your soul from some long departed demons who made you crave sin.

387
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:45,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be the straw that breaks your camel's loyal back and causes your beast of burden to spurn the desert of your depravity.

388
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:49,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let them hold a mirror to your faces.

389
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:53,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let their light shine on shameful places.

390
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let them put our hounds through their paces.

391
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let their judges handle our cases.

392
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the poets.

393
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:02,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the poets.

394
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the poets first.

395
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:10,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good.

396
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:11,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that poem.

397
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:12,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I just love it.

398
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:14,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so pleased that you were reading it.

399
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:14,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

400
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

401
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:17,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Sally Forth.

402
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Sally Forth, indeed.

403
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what Sally has to say about that.

404
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:22,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

405
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:24,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

406
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they keep calling me?

407
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:28,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Shirley.

408
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:29,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call me Shirley.

409
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:30,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

410
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:31,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

411
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:33,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I love English.

412
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:39,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it's a colonial language that took over my country and deprived me of my own

413
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there it is.

414
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:40,629
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

415
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,590
[SPEAKER_09]: What did Walt Whitman say?

416
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I contradict myself?

417
00:36:46,491 --> 00:36:47,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Very well then.

418
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I contradict myself.

419
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:49,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I am large.

420
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I contain multitudes.

421
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:52,452
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

422
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:54,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

423
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,193
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

424
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:01,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Shall I speak about a thing or shall I do a personal thing?

425
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:03,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you like.

426
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:03,975
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

427
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:16,034
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, everybody, well, most people must have heard about Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem Kubla Khan.

428
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:21,739
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point in your life, in school, the teachers must have inflicted that poem on you.

429
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope they didn't inflict it.

430
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:24,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you loved it, because I did.

431
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:31,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things about Coleridge is that, if you might recall, he was an opium addict.

432
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:40,370
[SPEAKER_09]: And the story goes that he was under the influence when he wrote that poem, which I can fully believe because the poem is so amazing.

433
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,891
[SPEAKER_09]: But he says that the first half of the poem was different from the others.

434
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:55,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he said that, but it is said that the first half is different from the other half because he was interrupted by a man from Porlock who came to the door.

435
00:37:56,054 --> 00:38:00,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So I make a reference to that, otherwise this poem is nothing like his, except it's called Xanadu.

436
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Daffodils light up the sidewalk, and tulips, crimson and purple, struggle into awareness.

437
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:13,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Trees exhale a sigh, glad at the chance of a rebirth.

438
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day is a why, followed by its wry sibling, why not?

439
00:38:18,312 --> 00:38:20,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sigh over their squabble.

440
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:25,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no truck with things that trick the mind, but sometimes I wonder,

441
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:34,691
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone came to my door, like the person from Porlock, would I forget my story and my song, even with clear-eyed, unclouded mind?

442
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Would I welcome that which would interrupt what I had barely begun?

443
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:56,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Would I, with songs and words, build that octagon with towers, people it with spirits, hedge it about with impassable things, and sit within, guitar in hand, singing of things never heard, of places never seen, of people never loved?

444
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:02,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Would my floating hair and flashing eyes keep you and you and you at bay?

445
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:19,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Would I look in a mirror and see everything, all of you, laterally inverted, flat, unknowable, and I know with a hard metronomic pulse of knowledge that I could never know what was real and what was its reflection?

446
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, wow.

447
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Metronomic knowledge.

448
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:25,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

449
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:25,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

450
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,576
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

451
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no.

452
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:33,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to go there.

453
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:35,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll get me in trouble.

454
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:38,509
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

455
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

456
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,390
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

457
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, OK.

458
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

459
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:44,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll kill you.

460
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick love.

461
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:46,532
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

462
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was that?

463
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:52,754
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't let them kill you.

464
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:54,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't.

465
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only life I have.

466
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:03,653
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's far too long.

467
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:12,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read a poem called The Ally.

468
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:23,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done a CD with some musicians, Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, and John Dalton.

469
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And we call ourselves The Ally Project.

470
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:33,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the pieces that we put to music.

471
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that we met at the,

472
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,462
[SPEAKER_02]: intersection of jazz and social justice.

473
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:47,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what this is kind of about, the ally.

474
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:54,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Friends become distant and strange, as if you have some creeping mange.

475
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:57,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Family wonders why and wrings their hands.

476
00:40:57,549 --> 00:40:59,630
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you choose them over us?

477
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We're your blood, bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh.

478
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,353
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like us.

479
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:08,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.

480
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Declarations have been made.

481
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:12,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Arrangements are in place.

482
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,821
[SPEAKER_02]: These are matters of our clan.

483
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Signs have been painted.

484
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:17,604
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be cast out.

485
00:41:17,904 --> 00:41:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be shunned.

486
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:21,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to stick with your own kind.

487
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:23,739
[SPEAKER_02]: An ally?

488
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:25,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what they're calling you?

489
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a hard road to hoe.

490
00:41:27,962 --> 00:41:30,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making strange bedfellows.

491
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You're casting your white pearls before swine.

492
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:35,489
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't raised to behave like this.

493
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Our family is a proud and honored clan.

494
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:41,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll never be lower than any black man.

495
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no room for them at this table.

496
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always been two sides of the track, a right and a wrong side of town, our kind and their kind, your people and those folk.

497
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to kill your mother and your daddy's turning over in his grave.

498
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:05,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to shout out Black Lives Matter, but the master plan is to make them scatter, to serve them pain on a silver platter.

499
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:08,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Our people own them.

500
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: For 200 years they worked this land.

501
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They were our property, our Negroes, hell, our niggas to make it plain.

502
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be out there with them.

503
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:25,639
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

504
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:28,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They want reparations.

505
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:33,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kick to the gut.

506
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:35,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't seem to get it, son.

507
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,480
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way the races run.

508
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough room for everyone.

509
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:44,022
[SPEAKER_02]: The time for black and brown is done.

510
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:46,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Show your pride and pick up your gun.

511
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: the side that has always won.

512
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be out there with them.

513
00:42:52,730 --> 00:43:01,541
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

514
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:12,714
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother used to say, life is hard, but fair.

515
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:14,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a good home, but you didn't stay there.

516
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

517
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,718
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a deeply powerful and very moving poem.

518
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:20,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

519
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:20,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

520
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,200
[SPEAKER_02]: One more for you, one more for me.

521
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

522
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:25,001
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

523
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:27,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see.

524
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:40,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And well, I'm sort of torn between reading something about something and something from this book.

525
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:42,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Your choice.

526
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:45,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I like them all.

527
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:47,755
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to read them both.

528
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:48,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You read them both.

529
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:49,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

530
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:49,855
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

531
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:53,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this one is called Drapo Aiti.

532
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:57,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote it for flag day, Asian flag day.

533
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:17,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Georgiana Chevry asked me to write for that event and I was really honored to do so which meant I had to do a lot of research because I don't like to go in and it's very easy to spin words if you're good at writing but it's you have to be careful and you have to think about what you want to say and whether it's relevant

534
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:24,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I did some research, and I knew a little bit, but I didn't know as much as when I dived into it.

535
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:28,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you write a poem about a flag?

536
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:31,775
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so I sort of wove some history into it.

537
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:33,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So Drapo Aiti.

538
00:44:34,276 --> 00:44:37,998
[SPEAKER_09]: O Aiti, beloved land of Taino and African,

539
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:43,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Land of hills so green and tall, of you I sing a song for all.

540
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:51,890
[SPEAKER_09]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of pain and sorrow, and joy and power and rage and blood and hopes for new tomorrows.

541
00:44:52,570 --> 00:45:01,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I salute and celebrate your flag that emerged in triumph after war, the upward march to claim your fate, sing Le Union fait la force.

542
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:08,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you and salute you for the land you wish to be, embrace you and I honor you and pray for harmony.

543
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:17,083
[SPEAKER_09]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of mountains tall, land of struggle, land of beauty, I sing your rise and fall.

544
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you and salute you, and I sing the song of you, of those who fought to take back that which belongs to you.

545
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:32,759
[SPEAKER_09]: In fateful 1791, O Aiti, you raised your head, and in the year 1804 you claimed your land and led.

546
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you, I salute you, and I sing about your own, of Toussaint, the all-saintly who led the way alone.

547
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:47,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you and I sing about the man who led the way, l'ouverture, the opening, brought in the light of day.

548
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:50,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And Toussaint was betrayed by one who did not keep his word.

549
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: He died in France and never saw the dream which had occurred.

550
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:02,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Your own flag flew, the white torn out, the red remained with blue, with the palm above the mountain in the year your story grew.

551
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:10,476
[SPEAKER_09]: You hold your head up, buoyed by the hopes of one another, to live, to work, to eat, to dream a land where none are other.

552
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:18,565
[SPEAKER_09]: O Haiti, O Haiti, O land of pain and sorrow, and joy and power and pride and blood and hopes for new tomorrows.

553
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:27,067
[SPEAKER_09]: May you fly both high and free above the land that you adore leave hurt behind and work for peace United evermore.

554
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:42,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I eat the Oh Haiti Oh land of pain and sorrow and joy and power and pride and blood and hopes for new tomorrows on this your day to you I say may you not be denied your sovereignty your right to be may peace be at your side.

555
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

556
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.

557
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh

558
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so beautiful.

559
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:46,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

560
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:49,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, absolutely.

561
00:46:49,595 --> 00:46:57,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to mention that Salim, who was the next leader, but I just wanted to talk about the beginning of it.

562
00:46:57,724 --> 00:46:59,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And he came and he did much more.

563
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:00,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's...

564
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:14,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Bespoke poetry, I think we kind of describe it as, it's like going to London and getting a suit of clothes from a fine clothier.

565
00:47:15,406 --> 00:47:19,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bespoke, it's made to your specific measurements and so forth.

566
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does indeed take some research, some getting down in the weeds to find out what the real story is, because you want to tell the real story.

567
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was beautiful, that was real.

568
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:35,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

569
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

570
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:38,062
Wow.

571
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:39,923
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

572
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:51,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you touched on it a little bit earlier when you said that with the political climate, maybe the arts could potentially be in a little bit of jeopardy.

573
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:54,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And we live in hope and expectation that that won't be the case.

574
00:47:55,975 --> 00:48:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think beyond the arts, one of the other things that we have to be real mindful of

575
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:09,125
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and particularly in fairness to the communities that we live in, is the whole situation with immigration.

576
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:24,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to read a piece that I wrote about, you know, kind of not being the America that some of us would love to see us all be able to live in together.

577
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So this piece is called Alienation.

578
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a fence without a gate.

579
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:31,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get in.

580
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to wait.

581
00:48:33,153 --> 00:48:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be foreign or somehow strange.

582
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:37,878
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't your home, home on the range.

583
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:39,940
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't arrive in a rickety boat.

584
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:42,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Our castle has a treacherous moat.

585
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:45,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't host refugees at our door.

586
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:47,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the sort we're looking for.

587
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Take good note.

588
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We stay on guard.

589
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:52,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want you in our backyard.

590
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:57,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

591
00:48:57,613 --> 00:48:59,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You say your country's full of peril.

592
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But like stray cats, we think you're feral.

593
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:04,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We think you're prone to filth and crime.

594
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:07,297
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want either at this time.

595
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care what the nations say.

596
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:11,338
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't do more than hope and pray.

597
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:14,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Our stance is clear on human rights.

598
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Lock the door.

599
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn off the lights.

600
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,142
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw that statue in the bay.

601
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It stood for liberty until today.

602
00:49:21,744 --> 00:49:25,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclasses.

603
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:27,848
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got militias on the border.

604
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:29,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They own big guns to keep the order.

605
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.

606
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:37,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we feel that this is good?

607
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we share the neighborhood?

608
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because you're black and brown?

609
00:49:41,118 --> 00:49:44,020
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we just choose to stand our ground.

610
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay in your place, deal with your issues, we'll send lots of coal and tissues.

611
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:53,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't form caravans and run, you'll find yourselves in the sight of a gun.

612
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no streets here lined with gold, our eyes are closed, our hearts are cold.

613
00:49:58,804 --> 00:50:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no flowing milk and honey, American skies are not that sunny.

614
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:07,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The fences we build keep aliens out.

615
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:09,593
[SPEAKER_02]: They serve to keep our faith devout.

616
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:13,734
[SPEAKER_02]: This land we scheme to make our own, it's ours, you see, and ours alone.

617
00:50:14,454 --> 00:50:18,435
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

618
00:50:18,496 --> 00:50:20,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't show your anguished faces.

619
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:22,717
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cutting back on other races.

620
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:25,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had enough of global inclusion.

621
00:50:26,017 --> 00:50:28,139
[SPEAKER_02]: We're winning this country of race confusion.

622
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how to win these fights and limit all these civil rights.

623
00:50:33,142 --> 00:50:39,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety nets in the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and the laid, a rising tide that favors the rich.

624
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:42,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our favorite campaign pitch.

625
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:47,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Me Too movements and Black Lives Matter, in all due time, your ranks will scatter.

626
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:52,134
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that you shall overcome, just cross this line, we'll give you some.

627
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:56,835
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a taste of burning churches and blackboards hung from oaks and birches.

628
00:50:56,855 --> 00:51:01,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prisons.com, the corporate plantation.

629
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:10,838
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking this country back to the time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield.

630
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:20,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

631
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:41,083
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking this homeland back to a season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs, when Confederate flags were boldly raised and crosses in the darkness blazed, and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate.

632
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:47,709
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought that this worm had surely turned, and young black bodies no longer burned.

633
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:52,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet here you are again today with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

634
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The MAGA caps we wear with pride.

635
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, let us know who's on our side.

636
00:51:57,593 --> 00:52:03,356
[SPEAKER_02]: The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

637
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

638
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:15,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

639
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:25,832
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided, his Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull.

640
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:34,780
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees abolition.

641
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:40,381
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power.

642
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:46,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing.

643
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:50,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

644
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:55,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt.

645
00:52:56,211 --> 00:52:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Tolerance is in short supply.

646
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:02,916
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't let your kind occupy the sacred land our forebears built.

647
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

648
00:53:06,138 --> 00:53:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

649
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:18,684
[SPEAKER_02]: To all you aliens who don't like strange, no room at the inn in our home on the range.

650
00:53:20,685 --> 00:53:21,145
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

651
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like, thank you, thank you.

652
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:26,808
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like, you get the last word.

653
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

654
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:31,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So read us to it out.

655
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,631
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, please.

656
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:52,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this is a poem that I imagined, I wrote where I imagined a detained child's memory of another life.

657
00:53:53,968 --> 00:54:04,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I read this at my college poetry reading, one of my students told me later that she had been a detained child, that she was Brazilian, and she had been in one of those cages.

658
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:09,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said, you know, they would let us lie in our own filth.

659
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, if a girl got a period, she could not pads, I mean.

660
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:20,590
[SPEAKER_09]: They would eat half-frozen burritos while the guards walked around with steaming hot, lovely food.

661
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:25,475
[SPEAKER_09]: She saw all that, and she said, actually, your poem made sense to me.

662
00:54:26,377 --> 00:54:28,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we try to remember better times.

663
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,923
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had written this poem long before I knew any of them.

664
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,065
[SPEAKER_09]: A dream of forgetting.

665
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:51,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere trees stand tall, like my papa, who stands both legs apart, arms akimbo, staring into the distance, hearing the sound of hogs before the peace of the afternoon shatters into a thousand shards and slices into our family.

666
00:54:53,383 --> 00:55:02,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, water flows like my mama's hair, rippling in the breeze after she's washed it, and she's hanging up a few clothes to dry in burning sun.

667
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:11,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But water is scarce, and we are scared, and we turn to face a land that has plenty, so much more than we can dream of.

668
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:15,338
[SPEAKER_09]: We are here now in this land of plenty, but there's none for me.

669
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:30,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I dream and dream to forget the hunger in my belly, the smell of unwashed bodies and the pain slicing me like a rough-edged knife when I think of both my parents, gone like the memory of a photograph in a dream.

670
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:40,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I sit on a concrete floor with little ones, hollow-eyed, hollow-cheeked, hollow-bellied, with no sound coming from open mouths, eyes dry, all tears gone.

671
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere there are flowers, pink and blue and purple, scenting the air, gladdening bees and tempting butterflies, which dance, lust-crazed and dizzy, above them.

672
00:55:52,302 --> 00:56:03,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, water flows like freedom, and I dance barefoot on grass, full of sweetness and the soft murmurings of gentle insects, so full of life and quiet rhythms.

673
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:04,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I dream.

674
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:11,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, my father still stands, tall as the trees, unbending, on another land that is green.

675
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:15,819
[SPEAKER_09]: He whistles, and the hogs and goats around him lie content.

676
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:21,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, my mother hangs up clothes to dry, her hair rippling like waves.

677
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:28,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I eat rich soft tortillas and drink cool water, my belly full of gratitude.

678
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:31,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

679
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So I told you, yes, that we are kindred spirits.

680
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you've listened to the poetry that we've shared, you can kind of see what I'm saying.

681
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:50,378
[SPEAKER_02]: We think about a lot of the same things as we write poetry.

682
00:56:53,632 --> 00:56:56,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of the same feelings and inspirations.

683
00:56:56,414 --> 00:57:02,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always a pleasure to get together with you, Vijaya, because I know that you're going to speak to my spirit.

684
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And you definitely have this evening.

685
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always a pleasure to speak with you.

686
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Always a pleasure to speak with you, Terry.

687
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:12,485
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lovely, and lovely to hear your poetry, too.

688
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:13,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

689
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:13,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

690
00:57:13,706 --> 00:57:14,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

691
00:57:14,146 --> 00:57:14,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

692
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:15,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

693
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:16,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

694
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:16,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

695
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:29,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for bringing your wonderful perspective and your great talent to the arts community in greater Medford.

696
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:40,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important work that you've been engaged in, and I hope that the city continues to respond with love and respect as you move into the last phase of your tenure.

697
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:50,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And to everyone watching, thank you so much for your attentiveness and interest in our discussion and the poetry that we've read.

698
00:57:50,588 --> 00:57:54,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

699
00:57:55,111 --> 00:58:01,376
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a break to reset our stage and give the musicians some headroom.

700
00:58:01,656 --> 00:58:02,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll come back.

701
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:04,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll share some announcements.

702
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get right into the music portion of the program.

703
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:10,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

704
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:16,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

705
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you guys are powerful.

706
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:34,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people who are gifted with words, I'll tell you.

707
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,851
Keep the mics where they are.

708
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:45,447
I hope you brought your lawn mower with you.

709
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,089
I wanted to get your auto lawn.

710
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,430
Yeah, you got it.

711
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:50,391
I did, yeah.

712
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:52,933
I don't know if you use lawn mowers for future.

713
01:00:52,973 --> 01:00:57,116
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good, especially if you're going to get like a coil around the lawn.

714
01:00:57,296 --> 01:00:59,017
Yeah, I don't know about that.

715
01:00:59,097 --> 01:00:59,638
I'll find out.

716
01:00:59,658 --> 01:01:01,639
Why don't I bring it over to you instead?

717
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:02,059
Yeah.

718
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:02,640
Yeah, yeah.

719
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,240
I have an idea.

720
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,921
I'm sorry, pick one or two.

721
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:05,982
Where should we put it?

722
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:06,843
To begin with.

723
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:07,043
Huh?

724
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:07,683
Pick one or two.

725
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:09,725
Show everybody in the room what you're going to do.

726
01:01:18,117 --> 01:01:18,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's see.

727
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,676
Let me spirit away that key.

728
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:23,043
Yeah, that would be nice.

729
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:27,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, another thing you can do is you can put it first and then use it to push the overdrive more.

730
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:28,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Check, check.

731
01:06:28,187 --> 01:06:31,589
And I do it now, but I don't always know how to do it.

732
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:33,430
I do them both at the same time.

733
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard.

734
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:36,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's easier.

735
01:06:36,732 --> 01:06:36,992
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

736
01:06:37,052 --> 01:06:41,294
Right on the rack then, with a. I don't get it.

737
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:45,097
It's my practice.

738
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:46,137
OK, baby.

739
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:47,938
Let's go.

740
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:50,480
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

741
01:06:55,954 --> 01:06:57,455
Let's see.

742
01:06:58,036 --> 01:06:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get my other glasses.

743
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:02,540
That's right.

744
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:06,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you do it for me?

745
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:09,147
[SPEAKER_06]: You're playing a different record.

746
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:39,877
do

747
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try this.

748
01:08:57,492 --> 01:08:57,893
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?

749
01:09:08,715 --> 01:09:17,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, while the band is tuning up a little bit, just want to give you a few announcements.

750
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:22,084
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thanks to everyone who joined us for our November program.

751
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:26,527
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to catch up with our executive director, Lisa Crossman.

752
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:32,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you who are in the room, to hear Donna McElroy, she was spectacular.

753
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:33,872

772
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:22,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so now it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical side of the ledger.

773
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:29,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Kadan's jazz performs blends of cherished musical styles and rhythms that are not commonly heard

774
01:11:30,187 --> 01:11:31,128
[SPEAKER_02]: in this region.

775
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:46,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Their repertoire is a confluence of musical styles and rhythms from Africa, the French Caribbean, Brazil, and American jazz, with emphasis on the lively rhythms of Compa and Zouk from Haiti, and Martinique and Guadalupe.

776
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:53,605
[SPEAKER_02]: They hope to inspire listeners toward a broader appreciation of diverse music and cultural horizons,

777
01:11:54,045 --> 01:12:05,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The five-piece band includes a guitar, piano, drums, bass, sax, flute, and percussions, all representing decades of experience by local professional musicians.

778
01:12:05,814 --> 01:12:08,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The group is organized by Mark Torgerson.

779
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:09,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

780
01:12:10,017 --> 01:12:10,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Mark right there.

781
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:15,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And my wonderful compatriots.

782
01:12:15,521 --> 01:12:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

783
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:21,486
[SPEAKER_02]: The band includes Mark's on guitar, Hillary Noble on percussion, and

784
01:12:23,365 --> 01:12:25,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Wins, okay.

785
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:27,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Flute, sax, okay.

786
01:12:27,668 --> 01:12:31,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell Coley on drum and percussions.

787
01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:34,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Shea on the keys.

788
01:12:35,254 --> 01:12:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, there it is.

789
01:12:38,456 --> 01:12:38,957
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

790
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:43,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And Galen Willett back there on the sexy, the big sexy, the bass.

791
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:46,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I needed.

792
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:47,325
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

793
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm West Medford welcome to Kadan's Jazz.

794
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:53,269
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

795
01:12:53,389 --> 01:12:53,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

796
01:12:53,889 --> 01:12:54,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

797
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,552
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

798
01:12:57,592 --> 01:13:02,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with a song that we usually start with, which this one is

799
01:13:05,874 --> 01:13:13,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first one I heard sort of along these lines of this music, which has got this compa feel to it.

800
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an instrumental.

801
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:16,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Roman Zouk.

802
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:39,545
do

803
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,481
do do do do

804
01:16:14,011 --> 01:16:14,653
do

805
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:41,433
do

806
01:20:50,026 --> 01:20:50,146
do

807
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:27,008
do

808
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:35,129
do

809
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:57,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I experienced a broken string.

810
01:24:57,599 --> 01:24:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, folks.

811
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to make a little adjustment here.

812
01:25:02,942 --> 01:25:06,383
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you say?

813
01:25:07,504 --> 01:25:07,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Say again?

814
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:10,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Zouk.

815
01:25:10,465 --> 01:25:10,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

816
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Always more zouk with this group.

817
01:25:13,147 --> 01:25:13,767
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy's fault.

818
01:25:14,787 --> 01:25:16,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get enough zouk, this guy.

819
01:25:17,329 --> 01:25:21,291
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

820
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:23,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get this guitar in tune.

821
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer the other one, but you won't have time to.

822
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:29,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.

823
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Mark, are we doing Big Brother or Z?

824
01:25:46,877 --> 01:25:49,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to do Take the Z. Gotcha, gotcha.

825
01:25:49,879 --> 01:26:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a, when I get tuned up here, we're going to do, we're going to do our version of Duke Ellington's Take the A Train, but we call it Take the Z Train.

826
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:03,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's got a little bit different rhythm to it.

827
01:26:14,689 --> 01:26:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unusual for the string that broke is one of the slightly heavier strings.

828
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:24,279
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually don't break, but there it is.

829
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know when they're going to do it.

830
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:33,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know my own strength.

831
01:26:38,492 --> 01:26:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been on there too long.

832
01:26:41,653 --> 01:26:44,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

833
01:26:44,674 --> 01:26:47,715
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

834
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:50,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Bear with us, bear with us.

835
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:08,588
I'm

836
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:26,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you Cornell for throwing that in.

837
01:32:27,162 --> 01:32:27,282

838
01:34:58,035 --> 01:34:58,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you.

839
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:00,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

840
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,866
[SPEAKER_04]: A little different than your usual take the A train.

841
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:47,752
do do do do do do

842
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:02,250
do

843
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:19,491
so

01:40:32,974 --> 01:40:33,075
do

845
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:35,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

846
01:44:20,649 --> 01:44:23,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our version of Got to Get You Into My Life.

847
01:44:23,771 --> 01:44:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

848
01:44:25,973 --> 01:44:28,315
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have quizzed him and said, did you notice what it was?

849
01:44:29,315 --> 01:44:30,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you have known?

850
01:44:30,296 --> 01:44:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew.

851
01:44:31,317 --> 01:44:31,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, see?

852
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:32,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't control.

853
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:34,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Our version of the Requiem of the Empire's version of The Beatles.

854
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's got it.

855
01:44:37,301 --> 01:44:41,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides our own touches, it's got a bit of both versions.

856
01:44:43,385 --> 01:44:46,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we ready?

857
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to try this?

858
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:03,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cornell, explain that one.

859
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:08,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell is our expert on everything Brazilian.

860
01:45:32,887 --> 01:45:34,008
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.

861
01:45:34,248 --> 01:45:36,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a secret sauce.

862
01:45:36,891 --> 01:45:37,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hexagon, right?

863
01:45:38,613 --> 01:45:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, it's got a flavor of baião in it.

864
01:45:42,676 --> 01:45:43,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Square.

865
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:45,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're right.

866
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,641
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dance to it too, you know.

867
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:48,923
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like for the cowboys.

868
01:46:08,193 --> 01:46:08,673
Here we go.

869
01:51:49,386 --> 01:51:49,629
do

870
01:52:45,663 --> 01:52:47,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

871
01:52:47,884 --> 01:52:51,364
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a premier performance of that.

872
01:52:53,845 --> 01:52:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: First time.

873
01:52:55,285 --> 01:52:56,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, so.

874
01:52:58,026 --> 01:53:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes, that was written by our fine piano player here, Michael Shea.

875
01:53:04,688 --> 01:53:07,368
Finite piano player.

876
01:53:07,388 --> 01:53:09,149
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what you meant, but okay.

877
01:53:14,233 --> 01:53:15,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Gola, I guess, yeah.

878
01:53:46,432 --> 01:53:50,893
[SPEAKER_04]: a song which is an instrumental version of a vocal song.

879
01:53:50,913 --> 01:53:55,714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's by a Haitian artist who I'm really fond of.

880
01:53:55,734 --> 01:53:58,815
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Beethoven Oba.

881
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:04,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like the first name Beethoven, O-B-A-S.

882
01:54:05,117 --> 01:54:07,597

[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

891
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:31,433

892
02:03:31,533 --> 02:03:39,415

[SPEAKER_02]: If you're gonna hang out, maybe the band will jam a little bit more, but if not, be safe and enjoy the rest of your weekend.

906
02:05:20,672 --> 02:05:21,052
