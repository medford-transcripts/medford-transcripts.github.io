36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

37
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to share my screen here.

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Share screen.

39
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

40
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:37,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

41
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:41,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this, people can see this now?

42
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:48,297
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

43
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:55,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have concluded all our budget meetings at the school department.

44
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We've prepared a draft budget.

45
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we're gonna go over tonight, kind of the results of a lot of work by school staff and administrators here at Medford School System.

46
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:21,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had our meetings, as I said,

47
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:33,051
[SPEAKER_03]: As we talked about at the last committee of the whole, there were a number of new positions requested by principals and by directors.

48
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:42,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We are taking the position that, you know, we're gonna hold on those positions for now.

49
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:51,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, certainly there's budget considerations with adding a lot of new positions, but the two main reasons are that,

50
00:03:52,797 --> 00:04:04,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have, or we are planning on adopting a new schedule for the high school, and we don't know what implications that might have on staffing.

51
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:15,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the federal grant status for next school year is a bit muddled right now.

52
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect that,

53
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:29,928
[SPEAKER_03]: As we get closer to the summer, Desi may be able to give us some guidance on the status of those grants.

54
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:40,472
[SPEAKER_03]: We are planning as if we're gonna receive the grants we have this year, next year, but it's something that we're closely monitoring.

55
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:48,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say, as you'll see, is that we are not contemplating any

56
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:56,682
[SPEAKER_03]: across the board staffing cuts that were necessary to balance the FY25 budget.

57
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:04,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically the budget is in a lot better shape in FY25.

58
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:14,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the majority of the current staffing is funded in the budget proposal.

59
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:18,735
[SPEAKER_03]: The first

60
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:36,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Two categories is that we have to increase our current budgets to account for contract labor agreements that are expiring on June 30, and negotiations with those unions are underway.

61
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have to adjust line items to take into account step increases that

62
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Many staff are entitled to, pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements.

63
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:59,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Any salary adjustments that were made during the year have to be accounted for in FY26.

64
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:04,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And any salary annualizations also have to be accounted for.

65
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:15,119
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go through a list of budget adjustments that are necessary because,

66
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:19,907
[SPEAKER_03]: The current budgets are not aligned with their spending.

67
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:33,834
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one change we want to make due to food service regulations, and in a couple of instances we've lost grant funding, and we're going to account for that in FY 26.

68
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:39,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first line is to adjust the athletic budget by 32,500.

69
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:47,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And some line items within that budget have been level funded for a number of years.

70
00:06:48,587 --> 00:07:02,097
[SPEAKER_03]: The coaches line and contract services in particular are not adjusted for the current level of spending, the number of teams where

71
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,456
[SPEAKER_03]: that are competing, et cetera.

72
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll boost for that.

73
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:16,541
[SPEAKER_03]: During the course of this year, we had to add three one-on-one power positions.

74
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is mainly due to new students that entered our district with these positions on the IEPs.

75
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're required to

76
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,799
[SPEAKER_03]: put those on.

77
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: They're currently working this year and we're going to adjust the budget next year to make sure there's funding for them.

78
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:55,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We do right currently, Medford charges its lunch monitors to the lunch fund, which is not appropriate or not allowed under the food service

79
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:02,816
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations, so we're proposing to shift those positions to the general fund.

80
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost grant funding for two important software applications that we use.

81
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:19,766
[SPEAKER_03]: One's called ST Math, the other is MAP Assessment Program.

82
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:24,429
[SPEAKER_03]: These are currently funded by grants this year.

83
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,290
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not eligible for grants

84
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:31,937
[SPEAKER_03]: next year, so we're going to include those in the budget.

85
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:40,220
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an administrative suite of software applications.

86
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Frontline is one.

87
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:48,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an internet service provider.

88
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:52,484
[SPEAKER_03]: We have cybersecurity applications.

89
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:58,723
[SPEAKER_03]: the ticketing system, the Raptor system for visitors.

90
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:09,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So these, all these applications were not fully funded and we're taking money from other areas of the school budget.

91
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:18,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in 26, we wanna get those applications fully funded and have the,

92
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:25,746
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because they're critical to the operations of the school department.

93
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we added an academic lead position, which is essentially a building, full-time building substitute teacher at the high school level.

94
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We added one to the vocational program due to vacancies.

95
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the shops have a certain adult to student ratio attached to them.

96
00:09:54,582 --> 00:10:15,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So when one teacher is out, it creates a problem and it really became important to have a regular building sub for the vocational program that could learn the students, learn the programs that are offered there to support the

97
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:20,611
[SPEAKER_03]: the director and the students.

98
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:35,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also have a history of using nurse daily substitutes when there's absences to the extent that they are available.

99
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have never had a budget for that.

100
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:45,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna propose adding some money to the health services line to cover

101
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: substitutes.

102
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:53,189
[SPEAKER_03]: For security monitors, we had kind of two separate issues.

103
00:10:53,769 --> 00:11:08,078
[SPEAKER_03]: One, in the course of putting together this budget, we found that we did not sufficiently budget in FY25 for the number of security monitors we had.

104
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:14,702
[SPEAKER_03]: We had budgeted one less than we actually had on the rolls.

105
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:35,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And then during the course of FY25, we added a night shift security monitor because we had no way to provide coverage, dinner coverage for the other night shift security monitor.

106
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:45,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And in addition, there were concerns about a door that was unmonitored regularly over on the pool side of the building

107
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So that person was able to monitor that door as well.

108
00:11:51,076 --> 00:12:04,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So in FY26, we're going to fix those budgets by adding enough money to fund 14 security monitors district-wide.

109
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the beginning of FY25,

110
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged with City Year to have two schools receive City Year services.

111
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:22,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Those services are $100,000 per school.

112
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:35,151
[SPEAKER_03]: A portion of that 100,000 is charged to the before and after school program because their day overlaps into that program.

113
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:41,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But we essentially took money from our salary reserves to fund that this year.

114
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanna restore that money back to the salary reserve budget.

115
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:59,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're looking to add the $130,000 to the two schools that receive those services.

116
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:06,533
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, we've been working very hard with the,

117
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:11,769
[SPEAKER_03]: with that buildings and grounds department to try to right size those budgets.

118
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:23,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this year we have some assistance from Paul Riggi from the city has been very helpful, uh, in, um, doing this review of operations.

119
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:32,244
[SPEAKER_03]: But the two main areas that need funding this year are, uh, to really right size our maintenance budget.

120
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put here a list of.

121
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,452
[SPEAKER_03]: just a variety of maintenance areas that have to be covered.

122
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:46,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've gone through and assigned them what we think is an appropriate budget.

123
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:51,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of that $457,000 increase, about 122,000 is attributable to more money for maintenance

124
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:08,398
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we're establishing a grounds maintenance account and equipment repair and replacement account.

125
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also to address the extraordinary maintenance needs or capital needs, sometimes they're called in the schools and looking at the capital plan that was approved by the school committee and other

126
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:37,073
[SPEAKER_03]: projects that came up in the course of budget development, essentially.

127
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're looking to increase that external maintenance line by $330,000.

128
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:54,406
[SPEAKER_03]: In that, we desperately need to replace the air conditioning systems in our tech rooms.

129
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all of them have failed.

130
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanna make sure we have enough money to go

131
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,768
[SPEAKER_03]: and begin to replace those.

132
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:08,750
[SPEAKER_03]: We are anticipating a replacement of a fire alarm panel at the Missittuck.

133
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:28,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to establish a count, some budget bandwidth to replace shades and blinds in the schools as needed, sometimes door replacements needed, you know,

134
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:40,120
[SPEAKER_03]: minor roof repairs, bike rack installations, things like that we're looking to accomplish in 2026.

135
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:53,329
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some new spending we're gonna recommend within our network infrastructure.

136
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:00,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I should preface this by saying that we've captured

137
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:14,094
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the instructional software that we use, administrative software that we use, we've got them into their own accounts in the different programs that maintain these.

138
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:29,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost $800,000 worth of software that is operated as necessary for instruction and school operations.

139
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:41,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're proposing a new position of director of network and technology services that can lead that area into the future.

140
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:52,403
[SPEAKER_03]: A network technician that will work alongside of the current position that we have.

141
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:57,906
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one position described right now for network

142
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,933
[SPEAKER_03]: maintenance and really have to build up some capacity in that area.

143
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:16,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, we didn't have money for replacing equipment that's in the network.

144
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:24,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have servers and power supplies that have reached the end of their useful life and we need to begin replacing those.

145
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Likewise in special education,

146
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:37,464
[SPEAKER_03]: our transportation line is increasing in FY26 and by about $104,000.

147
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna give a separate, there's gonna be separate slides for special education, tuition and transportation a little bit later.

148
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Some,

149
00:17:56,337 --> 00:18:01,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Students qualify for extended year programming and those roles are increasing.

150
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:12,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So $53,000 of this amount is to accommodate those new students in extended year program.

151
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a project transition that you might know about.

152
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:22,337
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a program for 18 to 22 special needs,

153
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:31,168
[SPEAKER_03]: students, it's, you know, primarily focuses on life skills.

154
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:40,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And to this date, they did not have a budget, they kind of cobbled together budget funding from different sources.

155
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So $12,000, I think is money well spent for this group of students.

156
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:57,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the high schools also requesting to expand or, uh, to increase the amount of money they have for the summer program.

157
00:18:57,423 --> 00:19:02,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there's, there's no, um, general fund budget for the summer program.

158
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:10,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it, at one point it was, um, I guess it was contemplated that it would be strictly fee based.

159
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But over the years, students that need to attend the summer program sometimes qualify for a fee reduction or a waiver of the fee.

160
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So this $30,000 will provide the school with an opportunity to get more students into the program.

161
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:41,906
[SPEAKER_03]: properly funded.

162
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember last at the last committee a whole meeting, the summer school revolving fund was in deficit and this is gonna go a ways to correct that.

163
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:05,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have in the security monitor contract, the ability to hire daily substitutes.

164
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:20,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done so yet, but we should, if we intend to do that, we should establish a small budget in the security program to fund daily subs.

165
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:34,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guidance department would like to expand eligibility for PSA, AT exams, trying to get more

166
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:39,637
[SPEAKER_03]: juniors and sophomores to be able to take that program.

167
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:49,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And the world language department would also like to expand their assessments down to eighth grade.

168
00:20:49,043 --> 00:21:01,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So students entering high school can be properly placed in the right level for whatever language they're signing up for.

169
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of those categories

170
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:10,335
[SPEAKER_03]: was a $2,000 increase to their existing budgets.

171
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a little bit of savings to put towards this to offset.

172
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:31,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a student, we don't anticipate right now needing a tuition and transportation allotment for out of district vocational student.

173
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:34,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one student now who we expect to

174
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:35,928
[SPEAKER_03]: graduate this year.

175
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,794
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently have five student supervisory assistant positions.

176
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:43,975
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them are vacant.

177
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:53,744
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not fund the vacant position and that would leave four positions, one each for each of the elementary schools.

178
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:57,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to fund the

179
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:16,259
[SPEAKER_03]: $30,000 summer program, we're gonna reduce the supply budget at the high school principal's office, which I have discussed with the principal that still leaves her with a healthy budget of about $93,000 after that.

180
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:19,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a total savings of $101,000.

181
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:40,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So for special education, um, there were a couple of, couple of things happening in transportation and tuition that aren't going to be readily called out in the budget.

182
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:55,187
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that, uh, for our new special ed transportation contract, the rates went up, um, significantly in FY 25, uh, it increased what we budgeted by

183
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,580
[SPEAKER_03]: 500, almost $557,000.

184
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:09,171
[SPEAKER_03]: We had balances in our circuit breaker funds, which we use to close that gap this year.

185
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:21,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, we will need to continue to use circuit breaker funds towards the transportation budget in the same amount.

186
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in our

187
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:34,699
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, budget requests, we're looking to add $104,000, uh, to the general fund budget to cover the projected spending in FY 26.

188
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:50,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, likewise in tuition, uh, in FY 25, we had a $5.5 million budget for tuition and the tuition budget is, um,

189
00:23:50,832 --> 00:24:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: funded from three sources, one, the general fund, two, IDEA grant, and three, circuit breaker funds.

190
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:04,276
[SPEAKER_03]: All the tuitions were increased by the state by 3.87%.

191
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:16,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We also adjusted the budget for graduating students, students that are aging out of the system,

192
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:26,064
[SPEAKER_03]: move-ins that happened this year that are responsibility of Medford now, and new placements from within our district.

193
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:39,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get a little bit lucky with this budget in that some of the students aging out are in residential programs, which are very expensive.

194
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:45,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually had a drop in our overall tuition right now.

195
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know,

196
00:24:48,618 --> 00:25:11,650
[SPEAKER_03]: next year we may bring new out of district placements at some point, but for now we were able to level fund the general fund budget and we'll continue to charge about $850,000 to IDEA and then the remainder would be funded by Circuit Breaker.

197
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,452
[SPEAKER_03]: So between, we feel confident that

198
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: The circuit breaker funds we'll receive in FY26 will cover the 1.6 in tuition and the 557,000 in transportation.

199
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:37,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And there should still be some left over in case we have any new tuitions to deal with in 26.

200
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a summary of the grouping

201
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:53,617
[SPEAKER_03]: that we did increase comes up to over $4.5 million.

202
00:25:53,877 --> 00:26:09,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that that's not gonna be the budget that we get, but it's the budget that we would like to have based on the work we've done with staff.

203
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 5.5% increase.

204
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:25,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's about 2.8% more than the city has given us in a preliminary, uh, projected school budget.

205
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:32,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we do have, uh, we included in, in the budget.

206
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:44,809
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already baked in that we will continue to, uh, implement chargebacks to certain programs that use our, uh,

207
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:49,094
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities and our administrative services.

208
00:26:51,976 --> 00:27:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're working on now for the public hearing is looking to see what opportunities we have to close the funding gap and get as close as we can to what the city is projecting.

209
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:24,981
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're looking at right now is, you know, balances that are in our revolving funds that might be able to take on some positions.

210
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:35,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking, making sure we have all our positions that are funded in grants properly allocated to those grants.

211
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:43,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We do think we have this, the question aid funds that,

212
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:49,067
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the voters approved that provided, uh, $4 million for.

213
00:27:50,408 --> 00:28:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: High school, uh, new schedule implementation for teacher, um, salaries and for paraprofessional salaries there, uh, because those contracts were, um, in place for FYI 25 and the money was available in FYI 25.

214
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:42,267
[SPEAKER_03]: to the extent that, and we won't really know this for certain until negotiations conclude, but I'm thinking that there'll be a balance in that $4 million that we should figure out a way to carry that into FY26 to make sure that first,

215
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: $4 million gets paid out the way the voters approved it.

216
00:28:50,318 --> 00:29:11,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna, I think we can anticipate using question eight funds in 26 to help with those collective bargaining agreements that get approved either before this year or early next year.

217
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:14,002
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also,

218
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:23,541
[SPEAKER_03]: $391,000 in homeless transportation reimbursement that the state provides.

219
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:33,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would like to use that to offset our homeless transportation account and kind of get us closer to that city number.

220
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So that at the public hearing on Monday, we'll be able to provide a list of

221
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:54,125
[SPEAKER_03]: other opportunities that we identify to help fund the budget we're presenting tonight.

222
00:29:56,566 --> 00:30:00,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

223
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:05,929
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, from the chair, ask a question.

224
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

225
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Because 5.5% increase over fiscal year 25

226
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:25,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned the $4 million carryover, because yes, we need to spend that the way the voters expect us to spend it.

227
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:36,330
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also can use some of that money for things we outlined in the questions, which I think would cover a lot of what you had in that $500,000 range for maintenance.

228
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that being included to be paid for out of the 4 million, or is that included in the 5.5% increase?

229
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:56,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we obviously don't want to use the 4 million to extenuate a situation where we're keeping personnel that we can't afford down the line and just getting in another hole.

230
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:59,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you maybe explain that?

231
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:00,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that bring this down to 5%?

232
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:17,747
[SPEAKER_03]: The $4 million, we're not going to know until negotiations are settled.

233
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:29,256
[SPEAKER_03]: But we expect that a portion of that will be paid out in FY25, particularly for the schedule implementation.

234
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:38,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be that some, in the final settlement, that some monies get paid out in FY25.

235
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:48,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't anticipate we'll have the whole 4 million, but there might be a balance to tap.

236
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:57,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as the question seven money, that's already kind of baked in into the bottom line.

237
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:04,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It was used to, we submitted a supplemental budget.

238
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:10,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of those positions and spending that got covered in the supplemental budget

239
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:15,944
[SPEAKER_03]: are being carried into FY26, so that money's basically accounted for.

240
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:30,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know the three million is accounted for, it's the four million, so are we reserving a certain portion for the contracts which aren't up until June 30th?

241
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:36,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, what one-time costs can we use so there's not a 5.5% increase?

242
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,474
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've been adding things.

243
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:59,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're gonna with this, this is our job tomorrow and over the weekend is to see, you know, what are the resources we can bring to be to get that 5.5% down.

244
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:05,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, that'll be our job to work on that.

245
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:07,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um,

246
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:22,158
[SPEAKER_03]: the, there will be some portion of the 4 million that I think will still be available for teacher and paraprofessional contracts in 26.

247
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:39,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, the other thing we have to be cognizant of is that eventually when that money runs out, it has to be replaced in the budget or positions have to be cut

248
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:54,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we should be intentional about how we want to kind of wind down from whatever money out of question eight gets rolled into 26.

249
00:33:54,219 --> 00:34:02,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and hopefully there's more progress before just next week, because with a $7.5 million override, you wouldn't

250
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:09,757
[SPEAKER_01]: we were, I think we were all hoping maybe not to be in a position where we had to cut anything if we planned correctly.

251
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully there's more work that will be done.

252
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:23,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not in seeing this picture is as a 5.5% increase and it's a little bit more manageable.

253
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:24,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

254
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:26,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

255
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:27,526
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on the same page.

256
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:28,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

257
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:29,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

258
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:29,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

259
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, so I just wanted to add a few things.

260
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:45,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday night, our budget hearing is simply to frame our request to the municipal budget right to the municipal government.

261
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:45,497
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

262
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:56,742
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're saying to everyone, including the council and the mayor, and I know you're here, but this is what we believe that we need.

263
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:07,028
[SPEAKER_00]: That 5.5% increase is actually not different than what our increase was outlined in Chapter 70.

264
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:09,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I looked at the Chapter 70 numbers,

265
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:19,196
[SPEAKER_00]: They outlined that our portion would be going up by 5.5% or something like roughly there.

266
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:22,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So that number is consistent with even what the state.

267
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Outlined that our number would look like right now.

268
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:31,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more complicated than that, but I think directionally.

269
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,467
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is not like, sort of out of bounds.

270
00:35:37,937 --> 00:36:01,661
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget process that we've laid out has another step later in probably May and into June to get to full reconciliation of what the municipal government is able to provide, which may require changes to what we outline and approve as our request, right?

271
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our request.

272
00:36:03,382 --> 00:36:04,802
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a step two that says,

273
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:14,880
[SPEAKER_00]: If our request is different than what the city ultimately can provide based on what the mayor recommends based on what the council proves, then we have to take another vote to approve.

274
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, a balanced budget, right?

275
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:21,244
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I'll mention, because we do have so many new members is.

276
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:34,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime that we are in active negotiations with the teachers union in particular, this time in the budget is as uncertain as it can possibly be.

277
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:42,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Because out of our 800-ish staff, almost 500 of them sit in the teachers union.

278
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:46,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So without clarity on that just yet,

279
00:36:47,484 --> 00:37:00,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of uncertainty that between now and June, hopefully fingers crossed, we will, like, get to certainty on and, like, put, you know, have a path forward that will allow us to refine this number with facts instead of.

280
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:07,537
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like we heard from Bob last night, like, we're planning, but these numbers are sort of always changing.

281
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:08,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that.

282
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:17,052
[SPEAKER_00]: When I remember going through this process a few years back, where we were at the end of a teacher contract, it was the same.

283
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:23,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of way, I'm certain feeling about, like, what was going to happen and where it was going to land.

284
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:28,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess, like, overall, I just want to make sure that the people who are listening.

285
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:31,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that a, this is a request.

286
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:51,926
[SPEAKER_00]: B, there is a reconciliation process, and C, the uncertainty that Jerry's having to deal with right now is likely to continue to change between requests and balanced budget and come into focus.

287
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that to say,

288
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:04,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jerry, for putting this together, because it allows us to see what the totality of the situation is.

289
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:14,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for a really, really long time, the school committee never got to see what the totality of the situation was and it led to things like.

290
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:18,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Underfunded maintenance budgets chronically that we're now trying to peel out of so.

291
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:25,516
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I don't I don't think this is a, like, a wild budget in any way.

292
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also don't think that it's like a final, like, catastrophic.

293
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:36,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Number, I just think, like, this is where we are in the process and.

294
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:47,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we're talking in plain language about what we believe that the district needs to serve students because that is a piece that was so missing for so long.

295
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:58,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can together make the decisions that we need to make between now and the end of June to get where we need to go and to get to that balanced budget.

296
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:16,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say thanks to Jerry he did a really great job, especially with like all the uncertainty that exists for us right now and it's not it's not just the teachers contract we have five contracts renewing on July one so there's a lot there's a lot of moving parts that.

297
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,531
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't his crystal balls probably is broken his mind.

298
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:27,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to know, like, where all of those things will land, but we're trying to work through all of that.

299
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:32,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to lay that out there, both from a process perspective and from a, like.

300
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:34,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is uncertain.

301
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:35,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this looks.

302
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe alarming, but.

303
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:41,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I do think, like.

304
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the right place to be in March, which is, by the way, earlier than we've ever been in this place.

305
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:55,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So all things considered, like, I'm calling tonight a win, even if it's not like a perfect slam dunk, right?

306
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:58,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think we're on the right track.

307
00:39:58,924 --> 00:39:59,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

308
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:01,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

309
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:03,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

310
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep the faith, I guess.

311
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:17,025
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no other questions, thank you for your presentation, Jerry.

312
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:22,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to your continued work and maybe some adjustments on Monday.

313
00:40:22,048 --> 00:40:31,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of course you all know this body and the city council and myself really have prioritized our public schools.

314
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:35,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with member Graham, we have deferred maintenance for far too long.

315
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's great progress that has been made.

316
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:42,184
[SPEAKER_01]: great to balance this a little better.

317
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:47,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ask is something that, you know, maybe the city can really get to, you know, reasonable ask.

318
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:59,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know member Reinfeldt asked last night, you know, some of the city services that have been put on hold because of us trying to really fund the schools as best we can the last several years.

319
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:06,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's work to do on the city and the schools and hopefully we'll get there within the next month or so.

320
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion to adjourn if there's no further questions?

321
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:15,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to adjourn.

322
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:18,025

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going by voices.

[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.

332

[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can you hear me?

[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, so yes, Mayor Longo Kern.

341

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

342
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:57,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting is adjourned.
