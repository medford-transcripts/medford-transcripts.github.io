    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=156.993s">[Gerry McCue]</a>:  Okay.
 Is this, people can see this now?
 All right.
 Well, we have concluded all our budget meetings at the school department.
 We've prepared a draft budget.
 And this is what we're gonna go over tonight, kind of the results of a lot of work by school staff and administrators here at Medford School System.
 We've had our meetings, as I said,
 As we talked about at the last committee of the whole, there were a number of new positions requested by principals and by directors.
 We are taking the position that, you know, we're gonna hold on those positions for now.
 Well, certainly there's budget considerations with adding a lot of new positions, but the two main reasons are that,
 We do have, or we are planning on adopting a new schedule for the high school, and we don't know what implications that might have on staffing.
 And of course, the federal grant status for next school year is a bit muddled right now.
 I suspect that,
 As we get closer to the summer, Desi may be able to give us some guidance on the status of those grants.
 We are planning as if we're gonna receive the grants we have this year, next year, but it's something that we're closely monitoring.
 And I will say, as you'll see, is that we are not contemplating any
 across the board staffing cuts that were necessary to balance the FY25 budget.
 So, basically the budget is in a lot better shape in FY25.
 So, the majority of the current staffing is funded in the budget proposal.
 The first
 Two categories is that we have to increase our current budgets to account for contract labor agreements that are expiring on June 30, and negotiations with those unions are underway.
 And we also have to adjust line items to take into account step increases that
 Many staff are entitled to, pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements.
 Any salary adjustments that were made during the year have to be accounted for in FY26.
 And any salary annualizations also have to be accounted for.
 We're gonna go through a list of budget adjustments that are necessary because,
 The current budgets are not aligned with their spending.
 We have one change we want to make due to food service regulations, and in a couple of instances we've lost grant funding, and we're going to account for that in FY 26.
 So the first line is to adjust the athletic budget by 32,500.
 And some line items within that budget have been level funded for a number of years.
 The coaches line and contract services in particular are not adjusted for the current level of spending, the number of teams where
 that are competing, et cetera.
 So we'll boost for that.
 During the course of this year, we had to add three one-on-one power positions.
 And this is mainly due to new students that entered our district with these positions on the IEPs.
 So we're required to
 put those on.
 They're currently working this year and we're going to adjust the budget next year to make sure there's funding for them.
 We do right currently, Medford charges its lunch monitors to the lunch fund, which is not appropriate or not allowed under the food service
 regulations, so we're proposing to shift those positions to the general fund.
 We lost grant funding for two important software applications that we use.
 One's called ST Math, the other is MAP Assessment Program.
 These are currently funded by grants this year.
 They're not eligible for grants
 next year, so we're going to include those in the budget.
 We have an administrative suite of software applications.
 Frontline is one.
 We have an internet service provider.
 We have cybersecurity applications.
 the ticketing system, the Raptor system for visitors.
 So these, all these applications were not fully funded and we're taking money from other areas of the school budget.
 And so in 26, we wanna get those applications fully funded and have the,
 you know, because they're critical to the operations of the school department.
 This year, we added an academic lead position, which is essentially a building, full-time building substitute teacher at the high school level.
 We added one to the vocational program due to vacancies.
 Some of the shops have a certain adult to student ratio attached to them.
 So when one teacher is out, it creates a problem and it really became important to have a regular building sub for the vocational program that could learn the students, learn the programs that are offered there to support the
 the director and the students.
 We've also have a history of using nurse daily substitutes when there's absences to the extent that they are available.
 And we have never had a budget for that.
 So we're gonna propose adding some money to the health services line to cover
 substitutes.
 For security monitors, we had kind of two separate issues.
 One, in the course of putting together this budget, we found that we did not sufficiently budget in FY25 for the number of security monitors we had.
 We had budgeted one less than we actually had on the rolls.
 And then during the course of FY25, we added a night shift security monitor because we had no way to provide coverage, dinner coverage for the other night shift security monitor.
 And in addition, there were concerns about a door that was unmonitored regularly over on the pool side of the building
 So that person was able to monitor that door as well.
 So in FY26, we're going to fix those budgets by adding enough money to fund 14 security monitors district-wide.
 And then at the beginning of FY25,
 engaged with City Year to have two schools receive City Year services.
 Those services are $100,000 per school.
 A portion of that 100,000 is charged to the before and after school program because their day overlaps into that program.
 But we essentially took money from our salary reserves to fund that this year.
 We wanna restore that money back to the salary reserve budget.
 And so we're looking to add the $130,000 to the two schools that receive those services.
 In addition, we've been working very hard with the,
 with that buildings and grounds department to try to right size those budgets.
 Um, this year we have some assistance from Paul Riggi from the city has been very helpful, uh, in, um, doing this review of operations.
 But the two main areas that need funding this year are, uh, to really right size our maintenance budget.
 So I put here a list of.
 just a variety of maintenance areas that have to be covered.
 And we've gone through and assigned them what we think is an appropriate budget.
 And out of that $457,000 increase, about 122,000 is attributable to more money for maintenance
 you know, we're establishing a grounds maintenance account and equipment repair and replacement account.
 And then also to address the extraordinary maintenance needs or capital needs, sometimes they're called in the schools and looking at the capital plan that was approved by the school committee and other
 projects that came up in the course of budget development, essentially.
 And so we're looking to increase that external maintenance line by $330,000.
 In that, we desperately need to replace the air conditioning systems in our tech rooms.
 Almost all of them have failed.
 So we wanna make sure we have enough money to go
 and begin to replace those.
 We are anticipating a replacement of a fire alarm panel at the Missittuck.
 And then to establish a count, some budget bandwidth to replace shades and blinds in the schools as needed, sometimes door replacements needed, you know,
 minor roof repairs, bike rack installations, things like that we're looking to accomplish in 2026.
 We do have some new spending we're gonna recommend within our network infrastructure.
 I should preface this by saying that we've captured
 all of the instructional software that we use, administrative software that we use, we've got them into their own accounts in the different programs that maintain these.
 And it's almost $800,000 worth of software that is operated as necessary for instruction and school operations.
 So we're proposing a new position of director of network and technology services that can lead that area into the future.
 A network technician that will work alongside of the current position that we have.
 We have one position described right now for network
 maintenance and really have to build up some capacity in that area.
 And then of course, we didn't have money for replacing equipment that's in the network.
 So we have servers and power supplies that have reached the end of their useful life and we need to begin replacing those.
 Likewise in special education,
 our transportation line is increasing in FY26 and by about $104,000.
 And I'm gonna give a separate, there's gonna be separate slides for special education, tuition and transportation a little bit later.
 Some,
 Students qualify for extended year programming and those roles are increasing.
 So $53,000 of this amount is to accommodate those new students in extended year program.
 And then we have a project transition that you might know about.
 This is a program for 18 to 22 special needs,
 students, it's, you know, primarily focuses on life skills.
 And to this date, they did not have a budget, they kind of cobbled together budget funding from different sources.
 So $12,000, I think is money well spent for this group of students.
 Uh, the high schools also requesting to expand or, uh, to increase the amount of money they have for the summer program.
 Actually, there's, there's no, um, general fund budget for the summer program.
 It, it, at one point it was, um, I guess it was contemplated that it would be strictly fee based.
 But over the years, students that need to attend the summer program sometimes qualify for a fee reduction or a waiver of the fee.
 So this $30,000 will provide the school with an opportunity to get more students into the program.
 properly funded.
 I don't know if you remember last at the last committee a whole meeting, the summer school revolving fund was in deficit and this is gonna go a ways to correct that.
 And then we also have in the security monitor contract, the ability to hire daily substitutes.
 We haven't done so yet, but we should, if we intend to do that, we should establish a small budget in the security program to fund daily subs.
 And then the guidance department would like to expand eligibility for PSA, AT exams, trying to get more
 juniors and sophomores to be able to take that program.
 And the world language department would also like to expand their assessments down to eighth grade.
 So students entering high school can be properly placed in the right level for whatever language they're signing up for.
 So each of those categories
 was a $2,000 increase to their existing budgets.
 We do have a little bit of savings to put towards this to offset.
 We have a student, we don't anticipate right now needing a tuition and transportation allotment for out of district vocational student.
 We have one student now who we expect to
 graduate this year.
 We currently have five student supervisory assistant positions.
 One of them are vacant.
 We would not fund the vacant position and that would leave four positions, one each for each of the elementary schools.
 And then to fund the
 $30,000 summer program, we're gonna reduce the supply budget at the high school principal's office, which I have discussed with the principal that still leaves her with a healthy budget of about $93,000 after that.
 So we have a total savings of $101,000.
 So for special education, um, there were a couple of, couple of things happening in transportation and tuition that aren't going to be readily called out in the budget.
 One is that, uh, for our new special ed transportation contract, the rates went up, um, significantly in FY 25, uh, it increased what we budgeted by
 500, almost $557,000.
 We had balances in our circuit breaker funds, which we use to close that gap this year.
 Next year, we will need to continue to use circuit breaker funds towards the transportation budget in the same amount.
 And then in our
 uh, budget requests, we're looking to add $104,000, uh, to the general fund budget to cover the projected spending in FY 26.
 Uh, likewise in tuition, uh, in FY 25, we had a $5.5 million budget for tuition and the tuition budget is, um,
 funded from three sources, one, the general fund, two, IDEA grant, and three, circuit breaker funds.
 All the tuitions were increased by the state by 3.87%.
 We also adjusted the budget for graduating students, students that are aging out of the system,
 move-ins that happened this year that are responsibility of Medford now, and new placements from within our district.
 We did get a little bit lucky with this budget in that some of the students aging out are in residential programs, which are very expensive.
 So we actually had a drop in our overall tuition right now.
 Of course, you know,
 next year we may bring new out of district placements at some point, but for now we were able to level fund the general fund budget and we'll continue to charge about $850,000 to IDEA and then the remainder would be funded by Circuit Breaker.
 So between, we feel confident that
 The circuit breaker funds we'll receive in FY26 will cover the 1.6 in tuition and the 557,000 in transportation.
 And there should still be some left over in case we have any new tuitions to deal with in 26.
 So this is just a summary of the grouping
 that we did increase comes up to over $4.5 million.
 And we know that that's not gonna be the budget that we get, but it's the budget that we would like to have based on the work we've done with staff.
 It's a 5.5% increase.
 Uh, it's about 2.8% more than the city has given us in a preliminary, uh, projected school budget.
 Um, we do have, uh, we included in, in the budget.
 It's already baked in that we will continue to, uh, implement chargebacks to certain programs that use our, uh,
 facilities and our administrative services.
 And what we're working on now for the public hearing is looking to see what opportunities we have to close the funding gap and get as close as we can to what the city is projecting.
 What we're looking at right now is, you know, balances that are in our revolving funds that might be able to take on some positions.
 We are looking, making sure we have all our positions that are funded in grants properly allocated to those grants.
 We do think we have this, the question aid funds that,
 uh, the voters approved that provided, uh, $4 million for.
 High school, uh, new schedule implementation for teacher, um, salaries and for paraprofessional salaries there, uh, because those contracts were, um, in place for FYI 25 and the money was available in FYI 25.
 to the extent that, and we won't really know this for certain until negotiations conclude, but I'm thinking that there'll be a balance in that $4 million that we should figure out a way to carry that into FY26 to make sure that first,
 $4 million gets paid out the way the voters approved it.
 So I'm gonna, I think we can anticipate using question eight funds in 26 to help with those collective bargaining agreements that get approved either before this year or early next year.
 There's also,
 $391,000 in homeless transportation reimbursement that the state provides.
 And we would like to use that to offset our homeless transportation account and kind of get us closer to that city number.
 So that at the public hearing on Monday, we'll be able to provide a list of
 other opportunities that we identify to help fund the budget we're presenting tonight.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1796.566s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 让我们来看看。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1804.348s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 如果我可以，从椅子上问一个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1806.409s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1809.95s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 因为25会计年度增长了5.5％
 然后您提到了400万美元的结转，因为是的，我们需要按照选民期望我们花费的方式来花费这一收购。
 但是，我们也可以将其中的一些钱用于我们在问题中概述的事情中，我认为这将涵盖您在500,000美元的维护范围内所拥有的很多东西。
 那么，这是包括在400万中付出的，还是增加了5.5％？
 因为我们显然不想使用400万来消除一种情况，即我们要让人员负担得起，而只是陷入另一个漏洞。
 那你可以解释一下吗？
 这会降低到5％吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1870.641s">[Gerry McCue]</a>: 这笔400万美元，直到谈判结束之前，我们才会知道。
 但是我们希望其中一部分将在25财年支付，尤其是对于时间表实施。
 在最后的解决方案中，可能有些款项在25财年获得了款项。
 我不会预料到我们拥有全部400万，但可能会有一个平衡要点击。
 至于问题七资金，这已经融入了底线。
 它习惯了，我们提交了补充预算。
 因此，在补充预算中涵盖的许多职位和支出
 正被带入26财年，因此基本上是为了赚钱。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1938.005s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的，我知道这三百万是算出的，这是400万，那么我们是否要为直到6月30日才到的合同保留一定部分？
 我想，我们可以使用什么一次成本，因此不会增加5.5％？
 因为我们一直在添加东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=1962.094s">[Gerry McCue]</a>: 是的，我们要这样做，这是我们明天的工作，周末可以看到，我们可以带来什么资源来降低5.5％。
 因此，您知道，这将是我们为此努力的工作。
 但是，嗯，
 我认为，在26份中，我认为仍有400万中的一部分将适用于教师和专业合同。
 当然，我们必须认识到的另一件事是，最终，当这笔钱用完时，必须在预算中替换，否则必须削减职位
 但是，因此我们应该有意地考虑如何从第八笔货币上降低到26的任何钱中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2034.219s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的，希望下周之前有更多进展，因为有750万美元的覆盖，您不会
 我们是，我认为我们都希望如果我们计划正确计划，我们不得不削减任何东西的位置。
 因此，希望还会做更多的工作。
 因此，我们并没有看到这张照片增加了5.5％，而且更易于管理。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2064.464s">[Gerry McCue]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2066.045s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2066.605s">[Gerry McCue]</a>: 我们在同一页面上。</p>

 谢谢。
 成员格雷厄姆。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2073.533s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 谢谢，所以我只想添加一些东西。
 因此，周一晚上，我们的预算听证会只是为了将我们的要求框架给市政政府的政府。
 所以。
 这是我们对包括议会和市长在内的所有人说的话，我知道您在这里，但这就是我们认为我们需要的。
 实际上，5.5％的增长与第70章中概述了我们的增加没有什么不同。
 因此，当我查看第70章数字时，
 他们概述了我们的部分将上升5.5％，或者大致在那里。
 因此，这个数字甚至与状态相一致。
 概述了我们的电话号码现在看起来像。
 它比这更复杂，但我从方向上思考。
 这个数字不是一个范围。
 我们布置的预算流程可能在5月和6月的晚些时候又一步，以完全和解市政政府能够提供的东西，这可能需要更改我们的要求和批准作为我们的要求，对吗？
 所以这是我们的要求。
 第二步说：
 如果我们的要求与市长根据理事会所证明的建议最终可以提供的要求不同，那么我们必须再次投票批准。
 就像预算平衡，对吗？
 我会提到的另一件事，因为我们确实有很多新成员。
 每当我们与教师工会进行积极的谈判时，这一次在预算中，这是不确定的。
 因为在我们的800名员工中，其中近500名坐在教师工会中。
 因此，尚无清楚的
 嗯，从现在到六月之间有很多不确定性，希望手指交叉，我们会肯定地确定，就像说，您知道，有一条前进的途径，可以使我们能够以事实而不是事实来完善这个数字。
 您知道，就像我们昨晚从鲍勃（Bob）听到的那样，就像我们在计划，但是这些数字总是在变化。
 所以我认为。
 当我记得几年前经历了这一过程时，我们正处于教师合同结束时，情况是一样的。
 有点，我敢肯定，会感觉到会发生什么以及它将降落的地方。
 因此，我想，总的来说，我只想确保正在听的人。
 了解a，这是一个请求。
 b，有一个和解过程，c，杰里现在必须处理的不确定性很可能会继续在要求和平衡预算之间发生变化，并开始焦点。
 所以所有这一切，
 谢谢杰里（Jerry）将其放在一起，因为它使我们能够看到情况的总体是什么。
 而且我认为这是非常非常长的时间，学校委员会从来没有看到这种情况的整体，这导致了类似的事情。
 资金不足的维护预算长期以来一直在试图从中剥离。
 这，我不认为这是任何一种野生预算。
 而且我也不认为这就像最后一个灾难性的。
 我只是认为，这就是我们正在流程中的地方。
 我很高兴我们正在用简单的语言谈论我们认为该地区需要为学生提供服务的内容，因为这是一件如此长时间缺少的作品。
 现在，我们可以共同做出我们需要做出的决定，从现在到6月底，以使我们需要去的地方并达到平衡的预算。
 我只想说，感谢杰里（Jerry），他做得非常出色，尤其是像现在对我们存在的所有不确定性一样，不仅仅是教师合同，我们在7月有五项合同续签，所以有很多动人的部分。
 他不能打破他的水晶球。
 因此，很难知道所有这些东西都会降落的地方，但是我们正在努力解决所有这些问题。
 因此，我只是想从过程的角度和从一个类似的角度来放置它。
 是的，这是不确定的。
 是的，这看起来。
 也许令人震惊，但是。
 我确实想，喜欢。
 这就像三月的正确位置一样，顺便说一句，比我们在这个地方早。
 因此，考虑到今晚我称之为胜利的所有因素，即使这不是一个完美的大满贯扣篮，对吗？
 就像，我认为我们在正确的道路上。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2401.044s">[Gerry McCue]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FH9HjEKbOIc&t=2403.045s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 我想我会保持信仰。
 如果没有其他问题，请感谢您的演讲，杰里。
 我期待您的继续工作，也许会在星期一进行一些调整。
 而且，因为您当然都知道这个机构和市议会，而我本人确实将我们的公立学校优先考虑。
 我同意格雷厄姆成员的观点，我们推迟了维护时间太长。
 因此，已经取得了巨大的进步。
 很好地平衡了这一点。
 因此，您知道，这是城市真的可以解决合理的问题的问题。
 而且我知道雷费尔德成员昨晚问，您知道，一些城市服务被搁置了，因为我们试图真正为学校提供最好的资金，我们可以在过去的几年中最好地为学校提供资金。
 因此，您知道，在城市和学校里有工作要做，希望我们在下个月左右到达那里。
 如果没有其他问题，是否有动议休会？
 休会的动议。
