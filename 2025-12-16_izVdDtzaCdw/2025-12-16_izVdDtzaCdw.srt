1
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:23,254
[SPEAKER_17]: For those of you that have arrived on time or even a little bit early, thank you.

2
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:30,655
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to give folks another couple of minutes just to arrive and get settled.

3
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll get going.

4
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:34,736
[SPEAKER_14]: On time or even a little bit early, thank you.

5
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:42,117
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to give folks another couple of minutes just to arrive and get settled.

6
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:43,597
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll get going.

7
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:46,178
[SPEAKER_14]: On time or even a little bit early, thank you.

8
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,390
[SPEAKER_19]: That was my fault.

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Just so you know, we're live on YouTube right now too.

10
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,134
[SPEAKER_17]: We won't have any more dramatic echoing noise.

11
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:07,555
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I muted the browser that had the YouTube stream playing.

12
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ken, for managing technology.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Very much appreciate it.

14
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:04,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello everyone.

15
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:07,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt.

16
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:47,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, for those of you that avoid or are not a fan of awkward silences at the beginning of meetings, we're going to get going here at about 4.05, just to let people file in a bit more.

17
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:59,828
[SPEAKER_17]: And just as a foreshadowing as well, the second advisory team meeting is going to be happening immediately after this one for exterior and interior design on this same

18
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:01,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoom meeting link.

19
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:05,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will sort of immediately switch gears afterwards.

20
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:16,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So towards the end of this one, you may see some folks file in and we will try to wrap things up right at 530 so that we can switch gears.

21
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:28,495
[SPEAKER_16]: It does appear that we're getting a good critical mass here, which is very much appreciated.

22
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,447
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

23
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,904
[SPEAKER_17]: think we're going to get going just so we can launch in.

24
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:57,306
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like we do have a good quantity of folks here.

25
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:08,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to start off by welcoming everybody to this first advisory team meeting for the Medford High School project.

26
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:16,983
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to run through a quick agenda just so everyone understands what the contents of the discussion are going to be here today.

27
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,965
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do a little bit of an introduction.

28
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:25,727
[SPEAKER_17]: both of our own team as well as the overall members of the team as well.

29
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:28,187
[SPEAKER_17]: We would like for everyone to introduce themselves.

30
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:38,750
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to run through what is this advisory team process and what does it entail as we move forward as well as what are the schedule milestones associated with it.

31
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:53,960
[SPEAKER_17]: For this particular discussion on MEP systems and sustainability, we're going to run through a couple of sustainability givens just so that people understand what are the baseline assumptions that we have to be working towards.

32
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,780
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll try to do that expeditiously.

33
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:05,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we're going to be spending the majority of our time actually listening to all the team members, all the expert stakeholders that have gathered here today.

34
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:15,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Really what this meeting is about is calibrating this particular topic to the voices of the Medford community.

35
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,809
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where we're going to be spending the majority of our time.

36
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:23,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Back to the slides.

37
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:26,874
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're just going to start off with our own introductions.

38
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:32,097
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll allow the left field team, Arno's project manager, to introduce themselves as well.

39
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:39,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're going to shift gears into the actual Medford advisory team members.

40
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,061
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to start things off, my name is Matt Rice.

41
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I am an architect, principal in charge of the project for SMMA.

42
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:51,159
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't believe Helen Fantini, our project manager, is on today.

43
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:56,144
[SPEAKER_17]: She is traveling, but I know that Suala is next.

44
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,532
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I'm Suala Jankum, an architectural designer here at SMMA.

45
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,114
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, and Andrew?

46
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,059
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Andrew Barrows, electrical engineer at SMMA.

47
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:13,785
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not mention this, but I appreciate all of our team doing it.

48
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:18,889
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we could please all have our cameras on as we introduce ourselves, it would be very much appreciated.

49
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:20,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Emily.

50
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,372
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, everyone.

51
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:23,473
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm Emily Ehlers.

52
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,454
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a mechanical engineer at SMMA.

53
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:27,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Martine.

54
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,998
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm Martine Dionne.

55
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,620
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm the sustainable design director at SMMA.

56
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,540
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

57
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,002
[SPEAKER_23]: My camera is not turning on that.

58
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

59
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:39,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Brenda.

60
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:41,877
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello, everyone.

61
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:42,558
[SPEAKER_36]: Brenda Lim.

62
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,459
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a Sustainable Design Project Coordinator at SMMA.

63
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomaso?

64
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.

65
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:50,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tomaso.

66
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:55,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a partner at TransSolar, and I focus on passive design, sustainable design.

67
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:56,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a climate engineer.

68
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,425
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

69
00:07:58,505 --> 00:07:58,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And James?

70
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,868
[SPEAKER_20]: James Job, Ecology Engineering, Plumbing and Fire Protection Engineers.

71
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,650
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

72
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:10,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the left field team, do we want to jump in here?

73
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:10,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

74
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:11,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

75
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

76
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:14,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

77
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:14,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everyone.

78
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:15,715
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Matt Galino.

79
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:19,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm one of the project managers for left field, owner's project manager.

80
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:24,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know I saw Jen Carlson on the call.

81
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:24,562
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

82
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:25,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Jen Carlson.

83
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,124
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the project director with left field, DOPM.

84
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:29,525
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think Adele's on.

85
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:29,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And Adele.

86
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep.

87
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:31,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

88
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Adele Sands.

89
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the education liaison for left field.

90
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:41,189
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and then I think we'll just run through the members that are listed here.

91
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully we have captured everyone that was in.

92
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:51,994
[SPEAKER_17]: If you are here and your name is not up there, certainly when we get to the end of the list, please feel free to chime in.

93
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:56,016
[SPEAKER_17]: We will add you as we go if there was some disconnect in the process.

94
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:14,050
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we run through the list and anyone is not here, we'll just make note of that and make sure that they are included in terms of getting the access to the recording of this after the fact.

95
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:32,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So in alphabetical order, it would be great also for the team members from Medford to really just introduce obviously yourself, but also what your connection is to the project, just so that we can understand context.

96
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:33,435
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be great.

97
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So we could start off with Libby.

98
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I preface things.

99
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,091
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give everyone a second just to make sure that the AV is working.

100
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,893
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see Libby joined.

101
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Ken, you said that she did or she did not?

102
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:56,538
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not, I don't see her on the list.

103
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so let's keep going.

104
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Sunny?

105
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Sunny Dillard.

106
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:08,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an architect and sustainability leader at an architectural firm that does mostly public schools.

107
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:10,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called HMFH.

108
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a Medford resident.

109
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:19,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a two-year-old, so she will be going to this high school.

110
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are my connections.

111
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:23,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

112
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:25,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Austin.

113
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:27,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Austin Dietz.

114
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,953
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also a Medford.

115
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:37,196
[SPEAKER_18]: residents have an eight-month-old who will be a bit behind Sonny's two-year-old, but will hopefully eventually matriculate to Medford High.

116
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:40,558
[SPEAKER_18]: My background is in solar.

117
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:48,241
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a project manager with a national developer and owner of commercial and large utility-scale solar projects.

118
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:49,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Fantastic.

119
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Audrey?

120
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:53,443
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi.

121
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:54,563
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry.

122
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:56,704
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm a teacher at Medford High School.

123
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,524
[SPEAKER_33]: I was out sick today.

124
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,517
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm a science teacher.

125
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,119
[SPEAKER_33]: I've been at Mefford High School for 26 years.

126
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,142
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm an environmental science teacher.

127
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:10,324
[SPEAKER_33]: I've been teaching environmental science for 24 years there.

128
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:15,368
[SPEAKER_33]: So I've seen a lot and I've been in that building my entire career.

129
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:21,253
[SPEAKER_33]: And so my goal and hope as being on this committee is to give input on

130
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:34,635
[SPEAKER_33]: My kind of wish list for sustainability designs and the needs for the high school based on now in the future, obviously, and based on my experience, both good and bad in the current building.

131
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:54,373
[SPEAKER_33]: and also to be a voice for the educators in the building, especially the science department, but really all educators in that the day-to-day grind and the moving parts of teaching, just to make sure that any input and decisions that

132
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:56,774
[SPEAKER_33]: are made or take that into consideration.

133
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:01,937
[SPEAKER_33]: Because over the many years, sometimes on paper things seem like a really good idea.

134
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:07,620
[SPEAKER_33]: But when you get into it day to day, it's not or it doesn't work as you planned or you think.

135
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:17,806
[SPEAKER_33]: So hopefully, by everyone giving input and ideas, I can sort of be that voice for the main people in the building, which are the educators.

136
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:19,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

137
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:20,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

138
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:22,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny.

139
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:26,825
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, everyone.

140
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:27,626
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm Jenny Graham.

141
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:41,858
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm the chair of the building committee and the parent of two current Medford High School students who likely will not see the inside of a new building so much, maybe outside chance for Lucas.

142
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:47,243
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just keep pushing all of our staff to remember that he graduates in June of 2029.

143
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,707
[SPEAKER_30]: So really excited to have you all here.

144
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,469
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much for joining, I think,

145
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,131
[SPEAKER_30]: these meetings will be really helpful and informative for us all.

146
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:00,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

147
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:01,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris.

148
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:04,377
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello, Chris Hogan.

149
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:15,888
[SPEAKER_29]: My wife and I have a son in high school and middle school, so unfortunately we'll miss it too, but been living in Medford for a while and very excited to contribute to this and help it better the community.

150
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

151
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:19,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Elizabeth.

152
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, everyone, and special hello to Martine.

153
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:26,135
[SPEAKER_24]: Love this mini reunion.

154
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:30,956
[SPEAKER_24]: I am a Medford resident for 23 years almost to the day.

155
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,597
[SPEAKER_24]: I have two high schoolers.

156
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,058
[SPEAKER_24]: So don't expect them to benefit from the new school either.

157
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,180
[SPEAKER_24]: I currently run a decarbonization program under Mass Save.

158
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,962
[SPEAKER_24]: And prior to that, I ran CHIPS, which was a national green schools organization that's now part of USGBC.

159
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,003
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm happy to be here.

160
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,063
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for including me.

161
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:51,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

162
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:53,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken.

163
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

164
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the chief operations officer for the Metro Public Schools.

165
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,269
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in charge of facilities, technology, and security.

166
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:13,432
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm keenly interested in making sure the systems we put in this new building are not only sustainable, but also easily maintained, long lasting, and provide adequate comfort and support for all of our staff.

167
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:15,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

168
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:16,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Sarah?

169
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,622
[SPEAKER_30]: I think Sarah was able to join today, Matt.

170
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,702
[SPEAKER_30]: She let us know that.

171
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:25,883
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, great.

172
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:26,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

173
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:27,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Nicole?

174
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:38,688
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

175
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:47,132
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is OK, actually, because the less people we have, the more time everyone will get to actually share some thoughts as we go forward.

176
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,853
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just trying to keep tabs on how many we have.

177
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:51,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Jessica?

178
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,320
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, I'm Jessica Parks.

179
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:05,069
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm a parent to a fifth grader, and I've worked in sustainable design consulting in my previous positions.

180
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:11,154
[SPEAKER_32]: And currently, I am a project manager for energy efficiency projects at MIT.

181
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:12,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

182
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:15,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Brenda.

183
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

184
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,361
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the climate planner for the city.

185
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:28,915
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been involved in HVAC and solar projects at the schools, and I do the city's energy and emissions reporting.

186
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:32,717
[SPEAKER_22]: So any amount that we can reduce those makes me happy.

187
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,978
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great, thank you.

188
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:36,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Luke.

189
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:41,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, everyone.

190
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:42,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Luke Reiser here.

191
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:46,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, I have three kids in the school system.

192
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Oldest is a freshman, youngest is a fifth grader.

193
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,291
[SPEAKER_21]: I serve on the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

194
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,234
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to be involved in this advisory committee.

195
00:15:57,634 --> 00:16:07,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel that sustainable energy consumption is important for certainly environmental reasons, but there can be economic benefits if it's done right.

196
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:12,023
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we have a lot of excitement about improving our energy consumption.

197
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,305
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to accomplish that.

198
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:15,625
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a guaranteed fact.

199
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:29,591
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly, there are guidelines that guarantee we'll have a more efficient structure, but I think we're going to have some goals to exceed the minimum.

200
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:42,017
[SPEAKER_21]: And getting there is going to involve looking at air source and ground source heat exchange, but also passive elements like light wells and sun-facing windows.

201
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:46,038
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll have to balance cost with benefit.

202
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:47,879
[SPEAKER_21]: When does breakeven occur?

203
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,660
[SPEAKER_21]: If it takes 50 years, then maybe it's not worth it.

204
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:58,110
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, certainly those are the kinds of things I'd like to have discussed.

205
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:13,336
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, my priority here, my goal is to help influence the shape orientation and infrastructure of our upcoming high school in a manner that affordably hits the best lead rating for the dollar.

206
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:13,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

207
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:15,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

208
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:17,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris.

209
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:26,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi everybody, I apologize, I am driving right now so my camera's off, but I have been a lifelong Medford resident.

210
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:32,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Me and my wife both attended that Medford high school, so I kind of know the ins and outs.

211
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Brother and sister are both teachers.

212
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:42,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Brother is a teacher at the high school, so I get some of that insight on what's going on up there, too.

213
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:52,294
[SPEAKER_12]: For myself, I have three children, a nine, seven, and a four-year-old, so they hopefully will all be seeing that high school.

214
00:17:53,867 --> 00:18:05,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And then for my professional career, I am a senior project superintendent at Turner construction, um, which pretty much all of our buildings now would be our lead buildings.

215
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:09,130
[SPEAKER_12]: The last buildings, uh, the current building I'm on is a lead platinum building.

216
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:19,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, done multiple lead gold buildings, uh, have done any, everything from, uh, hospitals to labs, office buildings, high rises.

217
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I kind of have that.

218
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,097
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, backup with that.

219
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:39,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, um, hopefully I can bring in some knowledge of current market conditions and costs of different things through, uh, the help of my company and stuff like that, what we publish out to help, uh, owners and, uh, developers and everything.

220
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:41,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

221
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:42,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Chris.

222
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:43,463
[SPEAKER_17]: And definitely safety first.

223
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's keep the camera off.

224
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,623
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a wise choice.

225
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:45,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

226
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:47,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Paul,

227
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:49,663
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello, everyone.

228
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:51,625
[SPEAKER_35]: My name's Paul, as you can see.

229
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:56,610
[SPEAKER_35]: I am starting my fifth term on the school committee.

230
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,952
[SPEAKER_35]: My kids have been to Medford High.

231
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,013
[SPEAKER_35]: My daughter's a senior.

232
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:06,478
[SPEAKER_35]: I've made a core component of my campaigns complete decarbonization.

233
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,780
[SPEAKER_35]: Highest lead is the minimum.

234
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,183
[SPEAKER_35]: So I look forward to

235
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,741
[SPEAKER_35]: making sure we do that.

236
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:21,386
[SPEAKER_35]: It was part of the school committee resolution I wrote, which expects that to be what this building will be.

237
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:27,990
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm looking forward to what that means because it's fun technically.

238
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:35,436
[SPEAKER_35]: When I redid my own heating system, I was so depressed that it was a couple years too early for geothermal.

239
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:36,476
[SPEAKER_35]: So I have just

240
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:48,187
[SPEAKER_35]: air source heat pumps, but I look forward to us having no gas connections to the building and having as little electricity being pumped in as possible.

241
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,088
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

242
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:53,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Lots of great topics there, and we will be touching on all those, I'm sure.

243
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And then last but not least, Nathan.

244
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:57,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

245
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.

246
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:01,550
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Nathan Scott.

247
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Medford resident.

248
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:08,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two kids in elementary school, so certainly hoping that they will be able to attend the new high school.

249
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:18,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I work in capital construction, managing programs for the design and construction of spaces like this high school, but not high schools.

250
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:23,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking forward to supporting this group and the building committee with that knowledge.

251
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to be here.

252
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:27,371
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

253
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:38,384
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, before we jump into giving everyone a little bit more opportunity to talk about your own project goals, I know some folks already delved into that, which is great.

254
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:49,512
[SPEAKER_17]: We do want to just sort of calibrate our understanding here of what are these advisory teams and sort of what is this process that we're embarking on with them.

255
00:20:51,269 --> 00:21:05,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So really what the advisory teams are, are a mechanism to bring in really diverse stakeholder voices into the design process for the new high school project.

256
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:17,108
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a common challenge with all communities that there's a lot of different voices that need to, that want to help guide the project moving forward.

257
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:25,955
[SPEAKER_17]: And we found that this process of really bringing in those expert voices is a very valuable one.

258
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:39,107
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we have found is effective is to break up sort of these advisory team discussions into four discrete groups.

259
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:43,791
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are not intended to be individual silos of discussion.

260
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:51,099
[SPEAKER_17]: They are intentionally, as is shown here, really a Venn diagram in terms of their overlap.

261
00:21:51,479 --> 00:22:00,609
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of overlapping membership between these advisory teams, between both members of the building committee, as well as other individuals.

262
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,891
[SPEAKER_17]: which really goes to the heart of the fact that there is overlap in a lot of these topics, right?

263
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:14,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Sustainability is very much connected to site, for instance, as is educational planning.

264
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:30,677
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're not intended to be disparate conversations, but it's necessary to give each topic its space to have a conversation, and then we'll eventually bring these together so that there's awareness of where those overlaps are.

265
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:41,930
[SPEAKER_17]: But these four groups that we are setting up as advisory team discussions is this one, sustainability and MEP systems, site safety and security.

266
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:47,876
[SPEAKER_17]: So overlapping both in terms of mechanics of the site, as well as issues of safety and security.

267
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:50,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Educational planning and equity.

268
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:58,085
[SPEAKER_17]: And there certainly are a lot of other threads of conversation going on right now on the topic of educational planning.

269
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,747
[SPEAKER_17]: There is educational visioning that's going on.

270
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,548
[SPEAKER_17]: There are detailed programming meetings.

271
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,411
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so much focus there really because that is the core of this project, right?

272
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:07,552
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a high school project.

273
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:13,136
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot else that goes into it, but it really needs that amount of attention and discussion going forward.

274
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:22,223
[SPEAKER_17]: And then lastly is exterior and interior design, and that is a very all-encompassing type of advisory team grouping as well.

275
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:42,387
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, we found that these four subjects are really helping to cover the large, broad strokes of the project and helping to provide some really valuable insight and an opportunity for the various stakeholder voices that need to play in.

276
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:59,806
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to cover the topic again, it's very self explanatory in terms of what the intent of what we want to cover here, both as part of this meeting today as well as the continuum of meetings that will lay out in front with this particular advisory team.

277
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:08,710
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are going to talk about specifically mechanical electrical plumbing, fire protection systems that are going to be going into the building.

278
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:23,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Eventually we'll get to the point of some recommendations for the TYPO system to be included in, as well as that connection to sustainable design, not just for those mechanical systems, but really the larger topic of sustainable design.

279
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:26,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's really just this very tight connection

280
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:34,722
[SPEAKER_17]: relationship between what we're picking for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection systems and the level of sustainability.

281
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:38,883
[SPEAKER_17]: But it is intended to be all-encompassing in terms of those two topics.

282
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,927
[SPEAKER_17]: A quick orientation to our overall project schedule.

283
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:53,410
[SPEAKER_17]: I know some of you have seen this before, but it may be new overall in terms of the project timeline.

284
00:24:54,381 --> 00:25:08,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I always point out the fact that the right-hand side of this schedule is our intended project completion date, which is July of 2030, and we are all the way still in the feasibility study at the left-hand side of the chart.

285
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:16,062
[SPEAKER_17]: The stars that you see noted here are our touch points for each individual advisory team meeting.

286
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:31,922
[SPEAKER_17]: So each advisory team will meet a total of four times through this early portion of the overall project lifecycle to help develop some recommendations that will be given to the building committee for incorporation in the project.

287
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:33,823
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be meeting today.

288
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:43,588
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a time scheduled already for the second meeting, and then we'll talk about also the third and the fourth meeting in terms of getting something on the calendar as we move forward.

289
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:50,718
[SPEAKER_17]: And just the organization of those four meetings, so you can understand the construct of them.

290
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Today is really a listening meeting.

291
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,802
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to hear from the advisory teams in terms of those priority goals.

292
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,104
[SPEAKER_17]: We will take those priority goals.

293
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:03,046
[SPEAKER_17]: For the second meeting, we will elaborate

294
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:13,112
[SPEAKER_17]: them we will add some context to them as well as add any topics that are necessary that maybe didn't rise up through the the natural discussion that we've had.

295
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:32,385
[SPEAKER_17]: The third meeting when it occurs will be a confirmation really of the discussion that we have at that second meeting and the establishment of a list of recommendations and then the fourth meeting will just be really reconvening to confirm the recommendations and pass those through to the building committee.

296
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,175
[SPEAKER_17]: And so again, the sustainability givens, I'm going to hand this over to Martine in a second.

297
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:43,741
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the things that we know are the building blocks for this discussion.

298
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:47,126
[SPEAKER_17]: So we just want to make sure that people are understanding where that is.

299
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:51,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, we can go above and beyond, but these are our baselines for a variety of reasons.

300
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:58,195
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, so we're going to make this very short.

301
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:08,422
[SPEAKER_23]: We just wanted you to understand what's included in the project at the base and then the ideas to talk about beyond, right?

302
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:11,444
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's three major

303
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:35,471
[SPEAKER_23]: areas, the MSBA Green School policy, which has requirements in terms of the sustainable criteria, the Massachusetts Specialized Stretch Code, which Medford adopted, and then your Medford goals or the Medford, what we understand of Medford's green guidelines and some of the policies.

304
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:40,753
[SPEAKER_23]: So for the MSBA Green School policy, basically the current policy,

305
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:46,420
[SPEAKER_23]: which dates from 2023, requires LEED Silver.

306
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:57,094
[SPEAKER_23]: Currently, it requires LEED v4, but with the upcoming LEED v5, which our project is going to be under in April, next April, it's likely they will update to LEED v5.

307
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:03,615
[SPEAKER_23]: It requires the stretch energy code, the standard stretch code.

308
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:15,963
[SPEAKER_23]: So by default, going with the fact that you're a specialized stretch code, we're going to have to comply and meet the standard stretch code, which is one of the requirements of the specialized stretch code.

309
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:21,847
[SPEAKER_23]: They subsidize full commissioning, MSBA does, so we go after

310
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,922
[SPEAKER_23]: MEP, Building Enclosure and Ongoing Commissioning, the full six points in LEED.

311
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:30,408
[SPEAKER_23]: And then they have specific requirements

312
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:39,454
[SPEAKER_23]: basic requirements, some of the materials and resources and indoor environmental quality points.

313
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:43,595
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's the base reimbursement, the base green policy.

314
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:54,899
[SPEAKER_23]: Then they have a 4% additional reimbursement if a community pursues a specialized stretch energy code, which Medford has adopted.

315
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:59,881
[SPEAKER_23]: So by complying with the specialized stretch energy code, there's an additional 3% reimbursement.

316
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:16,498
[SPEAKER_23]: And for an additional 1% we can pursue, we can elect to pursue and we recommend that we pursue more of the required materials and resources and indoor environmental quality points.

317
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,761
[SPEAKER_23]: Those percentage

318
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:25,044
[SPEAKER_23]: add up in terms of, you know, hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars.

319
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:30,526
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's important to consider this additional reimbursement.

320
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,267
[SPEAKER_23]: The project, like I said, will pursue LEADv5.

321
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:38,008
[SPEAKER_23]: LEADv5 is mandated next April, I believe.

322
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:39,029
[SPEAKER_23]: Next.

323
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,090
[SPEAKER_23]: So the full compliance with the standard stretch code is

324
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:51,519
[SPEAKER_23]: at the base and then with Medford being under the specialized stretch code, we have a choice between three pathways.

325
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:58,341
[SPEAKER_23]: The first pathway is all electric, which we highly recommend, all electric heating and cooling domestic hot water.

326
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:04,963
[SPEAKER_23]: If a project decides to pursue fossil fuel heating, then there's

327
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:13,946
[SPEAKER_23]: specific requirements that make it a bit, I would say that add criteria.

328
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:17,788
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you decide to pursue fossil fuel, you need to install

329
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:22,620
[SPEAKER_23]: fully installed PV to offset that fossil fuel.

330
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,122
[SPEAKER_23]: And you need to have electrification readiness.

331
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:29,084
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to set your whole site to be able to electrify in the future.

332
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:41,893
[SPEAKER_23]: With this school being designed and done for the next 50 years, it's best to right away plan for all electric HVAC and domestic hot water.

333
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:48,136
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's really what we've been seeing and what we're doing on the majority of our projects for the past seven, eight years.

334
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:48,697
[SPEAKER_23]: Next.

335
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:57,332
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we're aware of your, you know, green communities in Mansford, green committees.

336
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:00,578
[SPEAKER_23]: So and green goals.

337
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,359
[SPEAKER_23]: So you have the Go Green, Medford.

338
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:13,863
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a solar ordinance from our understanding that we would love to hear about how you're applying it to your public buildings versus private buildings.

339
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:17,644
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we are aware of your sustainable design guidelines.

340
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:25,867
[SPEAKER_23]: I think a lot of what we've seen in the given may bode well with your sustainable design guidelines, but we'd love to hear you discuss

341
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:38,821
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, how much, where do you want to go in terms of beyond the criteria of the green policy and the base lead and specialized stretch goal?

342
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:44,026
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.

343
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to pull down the screen share for a second and I'm going to just do a quick piece of math here.

344
00:31:56,692 --> 00:31:59,373
[SPEAKER_17]: to confirm what we have for timing.

345
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:07,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we actually, because we have about 13 people here, I think we'll have maybe four and a half minutes per person.

346
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:12,839
[SPEAKER_17]: We can give everyone, obviously folks are free to

347
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:24,491
[SPEAKER_17]: not take all that time if they want, but I do want to mention that if you're talking and just feel free to use train of thought as you're going, I will interrupt you.

348
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:26,632
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize in advance for that.

349
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:32,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely not something I feel comfortable with, but I have been tagged with being sort of the timekeeper role.

350
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:42,178
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we do cut you off and you have more to say, we definitely welcome, encourage any written materials to be transmitted through.

351
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:46,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we'll just figure out who the correct person to direct them to.

352
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,342
[SPEAKER_17]: It may be our OPM, but we'll figure out who to get it to.

353
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,543
[SPEAKER_17]: That should not be a big detail to organize.

354
00:32:55,503 --> 00:33:00,365
[SPEAKER_17]: But we will take written guidance as well if there's priorities that you're not able

355
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:08,656
[SPEAKER_17]: get through sharing once we get to your particular piece in the presentation here.

356
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,240
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm also going to just go back to my list.

357
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:15,978
[SPEAKER_17]: team members and we're just going to go alphabetically as well.

358
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to set up my timer.

359
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:27,149
[SPEAKER_17]: I won't be doing something obnoxious like putting a big clock up on the screen because sometimes we do that at public meetings and that can get a little ominous.

360
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,253
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll just have to wait for me to jump in.

361
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,477
[SPEAKER_17]: That will be where we start.

362
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if Libby has joined us since.

363
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,262
[SPEAKER_17]: But if not, I think, Sonny, you're going to be up first.

364
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:47,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

365
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:49,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Time starts now.

366
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:51,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Go right ahead.

367
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:51,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

368
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

369
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I

370
00:33:57,022 --> 00:33:58,023
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really interesting.

371
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:03,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to figure out how to start this because I have been in your shoes quite frequently.

372
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:09,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I lead a lot of public processes and do sustainability work with public schools.

373
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:14,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the biggest things that I think is most important is a holistic approach to sustainability, right?

374
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:15,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're thinking a lot about

375
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:28,813
[SPEAKER_01]: not just energy efficiency, we're not just thinking about water, we're not just thinking about daylight and views, but how they all interact together and what that experience is for the students and educators and the community, because it's a community building too.

376
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:39,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I also hold the hat of the co-chair of the Carbon Leadership Forum for the Boston Northeast Hub, so I think carbon is really important to me.

377
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:39,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I think

378
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested to see what portion of this school can be saved.

379
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an architecturally really beautiful school.

380
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:54,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are a lot of functional issues with the school, so I do think those have to be resolved as well.

381
00:34:56,241 --> 00:35:03,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sort of understanding what amount of the school can be saved, thinking about embodied carbon is really important.

382
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see some daylight studies.

383
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important.

384
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I think knowing

385
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:17,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing the impact that that has on students' ability to learn is really good.

386
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:23,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also tons of studies on teacher retention, staff retention, all that is really good too.

387
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:34,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I think thinking about materials, I know MSBA provides additional incentives for that and Lead V5 is going to be a bit of a hurdle to think about.

388
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:45,817
[SPEAKER_01]: the types of materials and the circularity of materials that we're putting into the building, because it's not just the health of the occupants that are in there, but the health of the people that are creating these materials for us.

389
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:56,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also goes into thinking about embodied carbon, so thinking about how we can not just benefit the school, but the community outside of Medford.

390
00:35:57,206 --> 00:36:02,750
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just a bunch of, Medford's like a big mix of people too, so we really want to support

391
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:11,814
[SPEAKER_01]: the community and thinking about what is built in Medford and how we can use local materials, how we can use local labor.

392
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have the Volk School.

393
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:24,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see the interaction of the Volk School and the sort of traditional core academics and how that can benefit teaching and learning.

394
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to think about outdoor spaces.

395
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is an incredibly tricky site.

396
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about how you can

397
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:33,322
[SPEAKER_01]: bring students outside.

398
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:37,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I know those things are all just really important to me.

399
00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:43,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that energy efficiency is something that is kind of a given now.

400
00:36:43,085 --> 00:37:00,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you presented that with the Specialized Stretch Energy Code, and I know that there's benefit in terms of cost, and I know that ground source heat pumps can pan out and pay back within 20 years, and that feels like a no-brainer if it's something that we can do on the site.

401
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:06,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there will actually be gas at this school because there are vocational programs.

402
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:17,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily mean that that's how you run the school and that's how the school will function, but I'm aware that that's something that I think will be important to teach the students as well.

403
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:29,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that on top of just knowing that there are taxpayers here and we do have to pay for this sort of helping bring them along is also really important.

404
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:39,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we have this small group of people here, but trying to get the message out to the community is something that maybe we take on as community members.

405
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:43,205
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love for this group to talk about how that message is shared with the community.

406
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:45,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something that's incredibly important.

407
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:49,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

408
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:52,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

409
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:57,369
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just four minutes, too, so that was perfect.

410
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's switch over to Austin.

411
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, thanks, Matty, for the opportunity.

412
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:12,836
[SPEAKER_18]: I think from my side, I started my career in energy efficiency and then moved over to the solar side.

413
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think echoing a little bit of what Sunny said,

414
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:21,359
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, you know, the efficiency is given and it's also largely the low hanging fruit.

415
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:32,002
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I think about bringing solar storage on board, um, the easiest way to, to reduce the overall energy needed is to just make that denominator as low as possible.

416
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:44,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so as, as the design is being put together, um, and, and, uh, potential rooftop or carport or other solar system is being sized and storage is being sized, um, you know, understanding,

417
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:56,798
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, you know, how, what steps can be taken initially, uh, to, to get, um, you know, to, to get the, the solar and the storage to cover as much as possible, um, from, from the outset.

418
00:38:56,818 --> 00:39:14,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'm, I'm interested as, you know, potential future, uh, parent, uh, and as someone who sees the, uh, who is currently now sort of, as we're starting this big electrification journey, uh, you know, nationwide, uh, a real demand for,

419
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:28,986
[SPEAKER_18]: electricians a real demand for for the services that vocational programs provide and so creating a building and creating an environment where the building itself is a part of the education.

420
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,151
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, you're creating ways of accessing the solar or accessing the electrical equipment in a safe manner, of course.

421
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:45,660
[SPEAKER_18]: But that really becomes, you know, where students are able to see sort of the direct inputs and outputs.

422
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:49,514
[SPEAKER_18]: And then learn from that as well.

423
00:39:50,375 --> 00:40:04,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think finally, something that I'm really interested in and just understanding from my peers on the group and from you all is just the landscape for renewable energy, for storage, the financing landscape is difficult and it is ever evolving.

424
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:12,791
[SPEAKER_18]: And so understanding sort of as those goals are being put together, what steps can the city take?

425
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:31,602
[SPEAKER_18]: What steps is this group able to take to maybe make some financial decisions that can lock in future benefits, whether that's, we call it safe harboring in the solar world, but what are steps that within the broader

426
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:45,150
[SPEAKER_18]: law and regulation that can be taken now or in the very near future such that the benefits are being realized from an overall cost perspective down the road.

427
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:48,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll leave it there.

428
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,347
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's a great point.

429
00:40:52,387 --> 00:41:01,092
[SPEAKER_17]: I think just also thinking about the fact that our utilities are going to be one of our critical stakeholders in this entire equation that we're putting together as well.

430
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:09,197
[SPEAKER_17]: So they will be brought into the conversation at a certain point if we can get them here as part of one of our advisory team meetings.

431
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:14,400
[SPEAKER_17]: That may be ideal moving forward just so they can be current to everyone's thoughts as we go.

432
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:24,883
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know if I had to guess, I'm sure someone on this call could potentially check me, but I would imagine that the high school was probably one of the larger loads in Medford.

433
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:37,691
[SPEAKER_18]: And so having, you know, there is some power in that, you know, maybe pun intended, with the ability to, you know, work with utility in ways that are advantageous to the school and to the students.

434
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:39,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

435
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:40,933
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

436
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:43,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it is Audrey that is next.

437
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:55,957
[SPEAKER_33]: I, um, so I said before kind of my goals, but I was just taking notes as people were talking, which is kind of adding into my, um, my thoughts about goals.

438
00:41:56,017 --> 00:42:02,042
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think being an environmental science teacher for so long, um,

439
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:15,016
[SPEAKER_33]: I think one of the most frustrating things that I've seen is when smaller decisions are not taking the bigger picture into account.

440
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:22,679
[SPEAKER_33]: So what I mean by that is taking the bigger picture of how not just the building, but Medford as a whole functions.

441
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:31,303
[SPEAKER_33]: So we make smaller decisions about waste management, not understanding that, for example, the trash gets burned, not go to a dumpster.

442
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:37,189
[SPEAKER_33]: And so it's great if you want to, for example, use compostable materials, 100% behind that.

443
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:43,195
[SPEAKER_33]: But if they're just getting burned and not actually being used for the design, do you know what I'm trying to say?

444
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:45,197
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just giving that as an example.

445
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:48,520
[SPEAKER_33]: I have tried for many years to try different initiatives.

446
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:54,484
[SPEAKER_33]: in that building, some with success and some with not, for various reasons.

447
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,765
[SPEAKER_33]: No blame anywhere.

448
00:42:58,186 --> 00:42:59,506
[SPEAKER_33]: I think water is a big issue.

449
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,267
[SPEAKER_33]: I work closely with the MWRA.

450
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:08,751
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think that I have a lot of thoughts about water, that we have some of the best water in the country.

451
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,612
[SPEAKER_33]: So making sure that that, you know,

452
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,217
[SPEAKER_33]: It's hard for me because so my floor in three.

453
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:17,359
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm on the third floor of the building was redone about 11 years ago.

454
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:19,680
[SPEAKER_33]: And so I have the newer section.

455
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:22,482
[SPEAKER_33]: And so I'm a little.

456
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:25,404
[SPEAKER_33]: I've learned a lot through that process and

457
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:36,312
[SPEAKER_33]: Also, maybe a little like for lack of better word gun shy about certain things because we you know we got millions of dollars, and they put in a lot of things that are that are not working.

458
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:44,737
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's frustrating right to see when you have people, you know, putting all this money and this effort into something and then it doesn't work.

459
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:50,541
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll say probably the biggest vice of that building is the roof.

460
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:59,570
[SPEAKER_33]: Over my tenure, I've seen that roof repaired at least four times, and we still have leaks coming through, even in the new section.

461
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:10,502
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's just another example of how it's like, you know, I'm not an engineer, so I don't know how to fix it, but it's like, I'd love to finally get stuff like that resolved.

462
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:25,291
[SPEAKER_33]: As far as energy efficiency, yeah, that building is not, even in my section, there's issues even, again, it's that old, it's only 10, 11 years old, but the HVAC doesn't work right.

463
00:44:25,651 --> 00:44:28,173
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's certainly frustrating because I know it's costing money.

464
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,094
[SPEAKER_33]: You know what I mean?

465
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,955
[SPEAKER_33]: And we try to vocalize on that.

466
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:40,403
[SPEAKER_33]: And so, you know, as far as going back to the gas issue, I don't think it's realistic not to have some sort of gas line going to the school.

467
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:47,330
[SPEAKER_33]: Not just for science labs, but I'm specifically thinking of the culinary department and the vocational school.

468
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,253
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, I know where we're at with fossil fuels, but

469
00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:53,834
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not realistic to say that we're not going to use them at all.

470
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,995
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't think we need to put in a line for heating the building.

471
00:44:57,355 --> 00:45:03,116
[SPEAKER_33]: But I do think that we're never going to 100% get away from them in certain aspects.

472
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:06,197
[SPEAKER_33]: And so I know some of the vocational school is going to need that.

473
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:15,039
[SPEAKER_33]: So my question would be not to answer now, but is there a way that we could have access to that line, the natural gas line, for certain things and not just heating?

474
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,439
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know if that's a possibility.

475
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:18,540
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, I don't know the engineering side of it.

476
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:27,788
[SPEAKER_33]: And just also to address the other thing about the VOC, the VOC and the high school is integrated for classroom learning, just so you guys know that if you weren't aware.

477
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:29,609
[SPEAKER_33]: So we'd already have that in place.

478
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:33,730
[SPEAKER_33]: And of course, my other thing too is I'm a big proponent of the Fells.

479
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:36,231
[SPEAKER_33]: My colleague and I, Ms.

480
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:39,212
[SPEAKER_33]: Carnabucci, who teaches environmental science, we do do outdoor learning.

481
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:40,912
[SPEAKER_33]: We take our classes outside in the Fells.

482
00:45:40,952 --> 00:45:42,213
[SPEAKER_33]: We utilize that space.

483
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,294
[SPEAKER_33]: So being able to continue to utilize that space.

484
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:49,015
[SPEAKER_33]: I've heard that there's plans to try to cut into the Fells.

485
00:45:49,615 --> 00:46:01,022
[SPEAKER_33]: which personally I'm not in favor of that being on the ecology side, but having access to it obviously is still important, but I'd love to bring more green in the building.

486
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,785
[SPEAKER_33]: because there's so much data about health and mental health.

487
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:12,828
[SPEAKER_33]: And just having green space within a building, I feel, would make a huge impact.

488
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,229
[SPEAKER_33]: And a green roof and just things like that.

489
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:21,951
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm kind of all over the place, but those are just my initial thoughts on everything.

490
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:24,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are excellent.

491
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:24,704
[SPEAKER_17]: No, thank you.

492
00:46:24,844 --> 00:46:29,346
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you're absolutely right that this is the time that we're just going to be framing questions we're not answering.

493
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:33,608
[SPEAKER_17]: I will just say really quickly that there are no plans to do anything yet.

494
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:37,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's a lot of rumors out there that we're going to be doing this or going to be doing that.

495
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,110
[SPEAKER_17]: We are just at the beginning of the process.

496
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:44,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And really, this is this and the other advisory team meetings, as well as all the other discussions going on right now.

497
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:47,192
[SPEAKER_17]: they are forming what that path forward is going to be.

498
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:52,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is no plan out there that we're following just yet.

499
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:54,394
[SPEAKER_17]: We're very much at the formative stage.

500
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:56,434
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

501
00:46:58,475 --> 00:46:58,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny.

502
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:02,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, Jenny, sorry.

503
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,514
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi there.

504
00:47:07,114 --> 00:47:17,197
[SPEAKER_30]: When I think about this space, I'm just so interested to learn from everybody who is on this call who lives in Medford and is so talented and qualified in this space.

505
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:32,401
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't have a whole lot to say about this topic except as the chair to try to attend as much of these meetings as possible and understand what are the things available to us as a community when we talk about energy efficiency,

506
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:38,542
[SPEAKER_30]: an MEP and what MEP even stands for, because this isn't the world I live in.

507
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:55,086
[SPEAKER_30]: But I'm just really curious and interested in what you all have to say so that we can make good decisions that don't repeat some of the things Medford is really well known for, like doing things on the cheap and then having buildings that don't work.

508
00:47:55,926 --> 00:48:02,067
[SPEAKER_30]: That's not the kind of process I want to lead, and so I'm super excited that all of you are willing to help us do better.

509
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:05,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

510
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny, I think you can choose also who you want to give your extra time to.

511
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:15,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Chris.

512
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:16,816
[SPEAKER_30]: Somebody more qualified than me.

513
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:22,178
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello.

514
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:24,079
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm Chris Hogan.

515
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:27,760
[SPEAKER_29]: I build capital projects for a living, representing the owner.

516
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:33,862
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a really exciting project and I'm happy to be part of it.

517
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:41,095
[SPEAKER_29]: My perspective is that projects of this scale are most successful when they focus on simplicity.

518
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:49,758
[SPEAKER_29]: The goals that the financing appear to require all the LEED certifications are awfully impressive.

519
00:48:50,638 --> 00:48:55,360
[SPEAKER_29]: If that's a building that gets delivered as a baseline, that's going to be a very exciting facility.

520
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:01,542
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm here to help offer the perspective of

521
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:06,882
[SPEAKER_29]: trying to keep it simple and share any other experience I've had on projects like this.

522
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:12,726
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's just, it's so exciting for the community to think about what this will bring.

523
00:49:12,746 --> 00:49:13,987
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm just glad to be a part of it.

524
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:16,248
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's it.

525
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:17,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

526
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,771
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that perspective on things.

527
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:24,114
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

528
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Elizabeth.

529
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,252
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

530
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:30,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi again.

531
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:43,703
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know from experience that we're in very good hands with SMMA on the team and also having someone from HMFH on this committee, which gives me confidence that there are some other things we can take for granted.

532
00:49:43,723 --> 00:49:48,547
[SPEAKER_24]: I also take for granted things like light shelves and so on, daylighting.

533
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:52,265
[SPEAKER_24]: My strength is really in putting pieces together.

534
00:49:52,465 --> 00:50:00,730
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we have so much expertise on this committee and on the building committee that I don't need to reiterate things that others have already said, but.

535
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:19,888
[SPEAKER_24]: When I'm talking about pieces, I mean things like it's all very well and good to pick certain types of very efficient systems, but if they're poorly installed or the design does not accommodate acoustics appropriately, it's going to mess up the background sound in classrooms.

536
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:28,814
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that daylighting is considered to be extremely important and I'm not saying that it's not but acoustics actually makes the bigger difference for students.

537
00:50:29,935 --> 00:50:35,439
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's extremely important when we're talking about ducted systems and the walls and any anything like that.

538
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:45,974
[SPEAKER_24]: There's also going to be a need for extra ventilation because we have all of the CTE programs, of course, a large kitchen.

539
00:50:46,074 --> 00:50:48,777
[SPEAKER_24]: We also have, we'll have janitor closets and so on.

540
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:54,184
[SPEAKER_24]: And so those systems tend to add to noise, but also energy use, they're extremely important though.

541
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:56,486
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to have to consider those.

542
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Ceiling heights makes a big difference.

543
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:17,927
[SPEAKER_24]: I could take you to, I'd love you to tour the McGlynn and see how the really high ceiling in the choral room slash green room behind the theater has fans at the very top that have never been cleaned and they're absolutely disgusting and that's just a horrifying thing in a school in my opinion.

544
00:51:18,694 --> 00:51:22,577
[SPEAKER_24]: So we need to think about all these other little pieces, maybe even not so little.

545
00:51:23,938 --> 00:51:29,501
[SPEAKER_24]: I know from talking to Principal Fallon that CTE is planning to expand into HVAC, so that's important.

546
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:39,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone mentioned that there will be gas use in the building because of CTE, so I think that's another example of where those students are going to have gas-fueled systems in their curriculum, I'm sure.

547
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:43,309
[SPEAKER_24]: I will reiterate that Mass Save is important to go for.

548
00:51:43,889 --> 00:52:04,575
[SPEAKER_24]: I also want to raise the point that it's extremely important that facility staff are involved in the design and the decision-making, and we need to consider maintenance and monitoring of all the systems long-term and what that means in terms of actual energy efficiency once the building is occupied.

549
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:05,828
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

550
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:07,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, one final thing.

551
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:16,617
[SPEAKER_24]: For those of us who aren't steeped in lead, could we get a primer at some point as to what, like, the key, the highlights are that we need to know?

552
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:17,558
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be really helpful.

553
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:20,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

554
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:20,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

555
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, I think we'll be happy to do that moving forward.

556
00:52:23,322 --> 00:52:25,704
[SPEAKER_17]: And those are exactly the types of things that we want to hear at this.

557
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:33,190
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's a desire for additional information at our next meeting, we can come with that as part of the presentation.

558
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:43,199
[SPEAKER_17]: So for folks that have already spoken and have things that are on their mind, you can feel free to submit those requests moving forward as well as written comments.

559
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:47,423
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can take those in and as we format the next meeting, be responsive to them.

560
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:58,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just mention really quickly that you're completely in alignment in terms of making sure that the facilities staff from the district as well as the building are included.

561
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:08,204
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Ken is carrying a little bit of that water here in terms of that representation, but there's many others besides him as well that are going to be included in the conversation moving forward.

562
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:14,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just jump back to our list.

563
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:18,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken, I think that was maybe a good segue into you, actually.

564
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:19,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not plan that.

565
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:20,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

566
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:27,751
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've been in public education for over 30 years, and I've been through seven in whole or in part projects.

567
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm really keenly interested in the outcomes of the projects.

568
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,252
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen stuff and projects go well and not go so well.

569
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:40,916
[SPEAKER_19]: And then five, 10 years later in the project that does not realize what we thought we were going to get.

570
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:44,398
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's incredibly important to me that we're focusing on those outcomes.

571
00:53:44,998 --> 00:53:54,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I know firsthand what difference it makes in a classroom when it's properly conditioned and proper lighting and proper environment.

572
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:59,095
[SPEAKER_19]: and all of that going from what doesn't work before a project and what does work after a project.

573
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:01,897
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are all really important to me as far as outcomes.

574
00:54:02,477 --> 00:54:19,409
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also really interested in projecting the energy costs because those end up being budget drivers in future years and making sure we're trying to reduce our energy costs as much as possible to try to alleviate the squeeze on the budgets that I see and have experienced.

575
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:24,774
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm also very interested in the commissioning process that goes after the fact.

576
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:47,852
[SPEAKER_19]: making sure it works as designed, and that we repeat that commissioning process in the future to making sure things that start to fall apart, get brought back into alignment, making sure our maintenance staff is fully trained and capable of maintaining this, because if we can't keep it going for long-term, for 50 years, it's just not worth doing it.

577
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:51,035
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's kind of what my interests and interests are.

578
00:54:52,495 --> 00:54:52,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

579
00:54:53,095 --> 00:55:04,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I've heard several references to commissioning, so we'll definitely dive in there, not just MEP systems commissioning, but I think envelope commissioning is certainly something that has come up with a topic that we're going to want to talk through and understand.

580
00:55:06,621 --> 00:55:07,001
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

581
00:55:08,582 --> 00:55:14,044
[SPEAKER_17]: So Sarah, Sarah was not on previously, but I'm not sure if she has joined.

582
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,745
[SPEAKER_17]: No, she said that she could not make it.

583
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:19,987
[SPEAKER_17]: So then we'll jump to Nicole.

584
00:55:25,557 --> 00:55:26,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Home was not on.

585
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:27,040
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not here either.

586
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:27,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

587
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:27,721
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

588
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:29,404
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll switch over to Jessica.

589
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,641
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I think everyone has said a lot of really great things.

590
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:41,483
[SPEAKER_32]: Energy, incentives, embodied carbon are all really important to me.

591
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:57,587
[SPEAKER_32]: Another one is thinking about siting, thinking about some of our more passive approaches to energy and sustainability as well for a building, not relying fully on the systems to do the work, but the building as well.

592
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:00,148
[SPEAKER_32]: But really,

593
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:08,205
[SPEAKER_32]: of kind of what I see day to day is more how the occupants interact with the building.

594
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:20,417
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, you can build the most sustainable building in the world, but if the occupants don't understand how it operates, if the facilities team doesn't understand how it operates, it's all for naught.

595
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:27,023
[SPEAKER_32]: And so it's really understanding what that building is supposed to do, how it should operate, and, you know,

596
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:30,892
[SPEAKER_32]: put a sweater on, you know, change set points, things like that.

597
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:53,720
[SPEAKER_32]: Just all of the education that goes around once it's built, you know, signage, occupant engagement strategies, you know, both what Austin talked about learning and kind of using it as, you know, building as a classroom, but also just kind of more passive occupant engagement strategies as well.

598
00:56:55,092 --> 00:57:12,707
[SPEAKER_32]: And then on top of commissioning, retro-commissioning, re-commissioning, but also fault detection systems can be really, really useful in a building to help flag issues on a regular basis and make sure that your building systems are staying in line.

599
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:14,908
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's kind of my focus.

600
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

601
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:20,053
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

602
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:24,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Brenda, I think you're up next.

603
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:27,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

604
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:32,195
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, yeah, a lot has already been said, but I would like to just reiterate a little bit of it.

605
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:36,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I'd love to see the building be as close to net zero as possible.

606
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:37,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

607
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:44,704
[SPEAKER_22]: So no fossil systems, ground source, heat pump, solar, a tight building envelope, like passive house.

608
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:49,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I second Sonny's interest in embodied carbon.

609
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:49,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Um,

610
00:57:51,610 --> 00:58:03,013
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also want to mention when we're thinking about wiring for electric vehicle charging stations, we want to include wiring for future electric school buses.

611
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:10,276
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also want to make sure we're considering indoor air quality.

612
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:14,997
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we've mentioned that there are lead points there that we're going to be pursuing.

613
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:18,478
[SPEAKER_22]: And then also,

614
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:25,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Reducing impermeable surfaces, Medford has a green score for large buildings.

615
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:37,582
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we just want to make sure that we're exceeding that green score and considering the fact that that building has had flooding in the past, which is surprising for its location.

616
00:58:45,308 --> 00:59:00,712
[SPEAKER_17]: The school bus charging is definitely something to think about in terms of the loads that are driven there and sort of the potential opportunities that it presents as well as sort of the site requirements that would come into play there in terms of housing those.

617
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:05,253
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's a great topic to unpack a little bit more as we move forward as well.

618
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:09,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to mention we have a draft bus electrification plan

619
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, that has looked at what the load, the potential loads for that would be.

620
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:15,755
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can make sure that you receive that.

621
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:16,956
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can factor that in.

622
00:59:16,976 --> 00:59:18,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Fantastic.

623
00:59:18,817 --> 00:59:19,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you.

624
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:25,463
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Luke.

625
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:31,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there we go.

626
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:38,378
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so yes, I've got 30 panels on my roof.

627
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got two electrified vehicles.

628
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been a residential adopter for the last decade.

629
00:59:45,384 --> 00:59:46,244
[SPEAKER_21]: There's pros and cons.

630
00:59:50,388 --> 00:59:51,448
[SPEAKER_21]: The school's a big project.

631
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:58,414
[SPEAKER_21]: There's going to be a Goldilocks zone for us, but too much of one thing or too little of another.

632
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,814
[SPEAKER_21]: is going to leave us with buyer's remorse.

633
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:06,376
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've kind of done a lot of research.

634
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:11,679
[SPEAKER_21]: I've looked at a lot of materials from neighboring high school projects.

635
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:18,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I'm a practical person, ultimately.

636
01:00:18,522 --> 01:00:20,843
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know there's been some discussion about

637
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:23,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Gas lines to the high school.

638
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:28,987
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't aware of the CTE need, but certainly that's a very strong driver.

639
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:42,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Another one is if, you know, we're all electric and we want to avoid a frozen pipe disaster in the future, it might be wise to have a gas fired emergency generator somewhere on the property.

640
01:00:46,637 --> 01:00:50,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Things I'd like to see in terms of our planning.

641
01:00:51,669 --> 01:01:01,814
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I want to see technical products that can lead to good recommendations that ultimately generate wise decisions.

642
01:01:02,554 --> 01:01:20,963
[SPEAKER_21]: So kind of supporting elements there would be, I'd like to see a survey of mechanical electrical plumbing systems that are in place in each of our surrounding schools, as well as a survey of their achievement levels for LEED.

643
01:01:22,674 --> 01:01:28,861
[SPEAKER_21]: I know gold is a target, platinum is a target, but sometimes silver is what happens.

644
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:31,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Wakefield is one example of that.

645
01:01:32,705 --> 01:01:38,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's reasons for that, costs, site suitability.

646
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:44,853
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not an expert, but I can certainly read the articles and the reports.

647
01:01:45,513 --> 01:01:53,158
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to get a canvas of the surrounding schools just to understand what our neighbors have achieved.

648
01:01:55,665 --> 01:02:03,468
[SPEAKER_21]: I came across a very good, simple pro and con comparison in Somerville's preferred schematic report.

649
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:17,793
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it was actually very good in just summarizing various factors, their costs, their benefits, some contextual notes.

650
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:22,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to have something like that prepared for our project.

651
01:02:23,555 --> 01:02:24,735
[SPEAKER_21]: It would help with decision making.

652
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:33,574
[SPEAKER_21]: I do want to point out that I'm very optimistic with carbon embodiment on our project.

653
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:35,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we can do really well with it.

654
01:02:37,374 --> 01:02:39,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Reason being, the gym is enormous.

655
01:02:40,095 --> 01:02:41,415
[SPEAKER_21]: It's almost a field house.

656
01:02:42,015 --> 01:02:42,956
[SPEAKER_21]: The pool is enormous.

657
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:45,776
[SPEAKER_21]: The CTE spaces are enormous.

658
01:02:45,836 --> 01:02:51,958
[SPEAKER_21]: The science wing, which is only 10 to 15 years old, those are large spaces that

659
01:02:54,128 --> 01:03:08,512
[SPEAKER_21]: we may potentially succeed in renovating, modernizing, and retaining, and avoiding the demolition, which I think will have benefit for our carbon embodiment score.

660
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:15,275
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something I'd like to understand better, what those opportunities are as we move forward.

661
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:24,322
[SPEAKER_21]: One area that I haven't found a lot of information on that I'd like to see, just a personal request, is the energy needs of the pool.

662
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:26,303
[SPEAKER_21]: That is not something I understand well.

663
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:34,504
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would hope that we could estimate it if it's not something that could be directly measured.

664
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:39,065
[SPEAKER_21]: I know the systems in the high school are shared.

665
01:03:39,105 --> 01:03:40,506
[SPEAKER_21]: There's four mechanical rooms.

666
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:50,934
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not familiar with how the routing of their outputs occur throughout the building.

667
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:57,320
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to understand how much it costs to keep that pool going.

668
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:06,048
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an important community asset and I certainly support retaining it, but understanding what it means is important.

669
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:24,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd also like to see a break-even chart that looks at total sunk costs and involves industry consensus assessments of future operational costs so that we can get a good estimate for our break-even.

670
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:27,909
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll have concepts, I think.

671
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,971
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll down-select to some concepts and ultimately pick one.

672
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:36,514
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like analysis to help drive that.

673
01:04:39,054 --> 01:05:01,037
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the very last thing before I sort of conclude is I would like to see an assessment of a tall, a vertically tall new build cited on the current grass practice fields, a new build

674
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:18,480
[SPEAKER_21]: structure that would connect to a renovated, modernized gym, science wing, pool, and CTE spaces, you can form an L. In the event, an approach like that is viable for our site.

675
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we're going to look at a lot of different concepts.

676
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:25,985
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking at other school projects upwards of 12, 16.

677
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:29,888
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of different things are going to get looked at.

678
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:35,329
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, you know, I just wanted to make a plug for that particular one.

679
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and then very last thing, actually.

680
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do have one more thing.

681
01:05:42,891 --> 01:05:45,331
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a very good report the MSBA put out.

682
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:52,973
[SPEAKER_21]: It involves a lot of technical jargon, but it also presents costs.

683
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:57,894
[SPEAKER_21]: And what they did is they had a company

684
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:19,610
[SPEAKER_21]: conduct a study, and I'm trying to remember the name of the company, but they put out a report in May that assessed the cost of retrofitting existing schools, so elementary, middle, and high schools, with all electric systems, so all electric HVAC systems.

685
01:06:20,971 --> 01:06:25,733
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we have a comparison for ground source, air source,

686
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:31,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And then variations of those, there's hybrid combinations that are possible.

687
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,181
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I came across this report.

688
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I found it to be informative.

689
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:43,724
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I just wanted to share that with the committee.

690
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:46,665
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a good one to read if you haven't come across it yet.

691
01:06:47,566 --> 01:06:55,929
[SPEAKER_21]: It's available on the MSBA site, but I think if you just Google MSBA heat pump study, it'll come up.

692
01:06:57,545 --> 01:06:58,806
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's it for me.

693
01:06:59,086 --> 01:06:59,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

694
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:01,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

695
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:01,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

696
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:02,229
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot there.

697
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:06,072
[SPEAKER_17]: And for those keeping score, yes, I did let Luke go a little bit longer.

698
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:11,136
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think there's enough time in terms of the overall allotment budget there.

699
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:16,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And certainly, pools are really a fascinating thing when it comes to energy use as well.

700
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,903
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot that we have done and that we can do and think about when we're going there.

701
01:07:19,963 --> 01:07:21,685
[SPEAKER_17]: So that'll be an interesting subject there.

702
01:07:24,187 --> 01:07:24,547
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

703
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:26,709
[SPEAKER_16]: So Chris, I think you are up.

704
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:35,198
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the being like a lifelong method resident and stuff like that.

705
01:07:35,779 --> 01:07:37,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to be like, proud of this project.

706
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I want people to understand what we're doing.

707
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:42,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I want everybody to kind of be.

708
01:07:45,682 --> 01:07:48,623
[SPEAKER_12]: believe that we're putting out the best thing forward and everything like that.

709
01:07:48,663 --> 01:07:50,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a huge thing.

710
01:07:52,124 --> 01:08:03,488
[SPEAKER_12]: You will always hear in MedFed that this doesn't work, or that doesn't work, but I feel like people are coming at this high school as, okay, let's change this thought process, let's make something that works.

711
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:10,071
[SPEAKER_12]: You always hear of the school systems, this is broken in a school, this is wrong, or

712
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:26,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Even people saying it today, this roof leaks, that roof, you know, let's make something that can be maintained, that is sustainable, that people can actually use, that the people that are going to be running the school actually understand, it's not too complex and overboard for them.

713
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:32,077
[SPEAKER_12]: The things that are able to be fixed and repaired, that's the biggest thing that we kind of deal with.

714
01:08:32,097 --> 01:08:36,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Things get designed and the maintenance of it is near impossible.

715
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:40,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It just leads to a bunch of different issues.

716
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:44,386
[SPEAKER_12]: The electrification is a big thing.

717
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:54,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of my last couple of jobs have been with the big buildings in Boston and Cambridge and Austin right now.

718
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:01,761
[SPEAKER_12]: The utility companies can't get the power.

719
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:05,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I've literally been working on a job for two and a half years.

720
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,962
[SPEAKER_12]: We're turning over the building next week.

721
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:13,004
[SPEAKER_12]: We got permanent power two weeks ago, and this is a full lab building for Harvard.

722
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:17,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So Harvard doesn't have the pull to get the power companies to get everything.

723
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:21,226
[SPEAKER_12]: A whole new infrastructure had to be brought in, and people gotta understand that.

724
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:23,708
[SPEAKER_12]: electrification is a big thing.

725
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:30,395
[SPEAKER_12]: The utility companies, it is a massive undertaking for them and a massive upfront cost for them to do.

726
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:34,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think that's a huge thing we got to understand is what are they going to need?

727
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is this power coming from?

728
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:40,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is the substations and all this work that's going to be leading

729
01:09:40,946 --> 01:09:57,963
[SPEAKER_12]: you know up this right down these main streets and up into there and like what what's that kind of kind of effect um i think is a huge thing that doesn't get over doesn't maybe get thought of enough um and we need to bring them in early on if this is the route that we're going to

730
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:03,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, thank you.

731
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:05,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we can stress that enough.

732
01:10:05,627 --> 01:10:14,754
[SPEAKER_17]: We're definitely going to get going with them as soon as we can, because the ability for the grid to support the building is something it's a huge topic.

733
01:10:17,937 --> 01:10:18,957
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, Paul.

734
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:30,386
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you going later is a blessing and curse because it's like, I want to respond to things and 2nd them all, but I won't make this go on forever.

735
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:31,949
[SPEAKER_35]: I do really.

736
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:37,665
[SPEAKER_35]: want us to consider a passive building if possible.

737
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:44,089
[SPEAKER_35]: I was reading that if you do passive, lead is like, just happens.

738
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:56,656
[SPEAKER_35]: And passive is like, is the outcome space versus lead, which is like the steps and the things that you said you would do and you did them, but that doesn't necessarily, isn't the same as what's it like when it's running.

739
01:10:57,957 --> 01:11:01,820
[SPEAKER_35]: So I don't know enough about those things other than to say that

740
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:11,456
[SPEAKER_35]: I am interested in this passive building, although I've heard also that that does sometimes limit the amount of light, not a windows you can have.

741
01:11:12,377 --> 01:11:13,277
[SPEAKER_35]: So I don't I don't know.

742
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:17,699
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, some of these buildings, I think, North and over and over.

743
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:20,701
[SPEAKER_35]: I always forget which one it is where it's like, it looks like a mall.

744
01:11:20,741 --> 01:11:23,922
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like the giant windows that are like, 3 stories tall.

745
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:29,570
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe those can be made to be as efficient as a wall.

746
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:30,110
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

747
01:11:31,731 --> 01:11:43,136
[SPEAKER_35]: I have a human factors degree and I really want to make sure we don't have doors that have handles when you push and basic stuff like that that still gets built every day in buildings across the world.

748
01:11:43,597 --> 01:11:44,877
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's so obnoxious.

749
01:11:45,477 --> 01:11:51,901
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's obnoxious every single time every user uses those things where the affordances are wrong.

750
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,683
[SPEAKER_35]: And we're all so accustomed to being like, oh, I'm so stupid.

751
01:11:55,723 --> 01:11:57,004
[SPEAKER_35]: I pulled when I should have pushed.

752
01:11:57,264 --> 01:11:58,065
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not us.

753
01:11:58,165 --> 01:11:58,985
[SPEAKER_35]: It's never us.

754
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:02,228
[SPEAKER_35]: It's always the mistakes that are made there.

755
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:04,849
[SPEAKER_35]: And those, you know, replacing doors

756
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:10,767
[SPEAKER_35]: as we know from having to do some at the schools lately, are so expensive.

757
01:12:10,847 --> 01:12:18,153
[SPEAKER_35]: You don't go in and go, you know, it's a pain, but it'll cost you $10,000 to replace it so that it's not a pain for the next 50 years.

758
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:21,435
[SPEAKER_35]: So let's do some of that stuff first, right?

759
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:27,641
[SPEAKER_35]: These are not things that are hard to get right, but you have to know that you have to get them right.

760
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:33,105
[SPEAKER_35]: I would really like that other article that Luke mentioned earlier, not the one that was linked.

761
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:34,586
[SPEAKER_35]: I can't remember what it was about.

762
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:38,139
[SPEAKER_35]: I think a comparison of the different options.

763
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_35]: So Luke, if you could send that to us, I'd greatly appreciate that.

764
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:50,302
[SPEAKER_35]: Chris mentioned the power companies, which I'm glad Chris brought that up because we bought all electric.

765
01:12:51,463 --> 01:12:52,443
[SPEAKER_35]: We were going to convert

766
01:12:53,002 --> 01:13:00,752
[SPEAKER_35]: I think all of our schools other than the high school to, I have it in my kitchen and I can't remember the names, kind of the stoves.

767
01:13:01,994 --> 01:13:02,414
[SPEAKER_35]: What's the word?

768
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:02,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Induction.

769
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:03,916
[SPEAKER_35]: Induction, thank you.

770
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:08,902
[SPEAKER_35]: We had induction, we had it delivered and then the grid couldn't handle it.

771
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:14,907
[SPEAKER_35]: And it was going to be like $400,000 for National Grid to do just one building or something.

772
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:22,693
[SPEAKER_35]: So we sent them all back and had to buy brand new gas equipment that will last for a couple of decades.

773
01:13:23,013 --> 01:13:29,958
[SPEAKER_35]: So there's no chance of not emitting gas in those buildings for quite a long time.

774
01:13:30,258 --> 01:13:32,279
[SPEAKER_35]: They're not home stoves.

775
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,901
[SPEAKER_35]: These are very expensive pieces of equipment.

776
01:13:35,001 --> 01:13:36,122
[SPEAKER_35]: So I think

777
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:42,666
[SPEAKER_35]: That power issue, I was super glad to hear about the school bus electric infrastructure.

778
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:50,875
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, yes, yes, because I know Worcester has been bringing their busing in-house.

779
01:13:50,935 --> 01:13:52,277
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think they've done the whole thing yet.

780
01:13:53,318 --> 01:13:56,281
[SPEAKER_35]: And I always assume that if you do in-house busing, it's more expensive.

781
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:58,104
[SPEAKER_35]: And the actual answer is it is way cheaper.

782
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:04,596
[SPEAKER_35]: You can hire employees because you give them benefits and they're in a union and you can use them at other hours for other things.

783
01:14:05,137 --> 01:14:14,746
[SPEAKER_35]: It's actually cheaper, but you've got to have a place to do it and you've got to have the infrastructure, both mechanically, but also from a management perspective to be able to do that.

784
01:14:16,347 --> 01:14:23,254
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think we have any of that right now, but I would like us to not feel ready and then need to give National Grid and whatever

785
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:28,548
[SPEAKER_35]: millions and millions of dollars so that we could even start the project.

786
01:14:28,568 --> 01:14:31,528
[SPEAKER_35]: I hope I'm not going too long.

787
01:14:31,848 --> 01:14:43,430
[SPEAKER_35]: I also did want to say something about costs, because I know I'm always on one end of costs, and I'm sure it looks like I just want to spend all the money Medford taxpayers have ever had and will ever have.

788
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,391
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, let's just spend it all on schools.

789
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:47,051
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's not the case.

790
01:14:47,211 --> 01:14:52,572
[SPEAKER_35]: But at least in my experience, things are not going to get cheaper.

791
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:54,328
[SPEAKER_35]: just don't.

792
01:14:55,249 --> 01:15:03,453
[SPEAKER_35]: And so, you know, we could have built this whole high school without MSBA seven years ago for less than we're going to build it now.

793
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:08,596
[SPEAKER_35]: So any delays about things that we want

794
01:15:10,116 --> 01:15:15,759
[SPEAKER_35]: is in my mind not fiscally responsible because it will always cost more.

795
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,542
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is, I've been in the school committee for eight years.

796
01:15:19,902 --> 01:15:23,304
[SPEAKER_35]: There has never been a year when we had enough money, not even close.

797
01:15:23,624 --> 01:15:28,307
[SPEAKER_35]: And I don't predict in my lifetime that the answer is there will be a year where we have enough money.

798
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:31,669
[SPEAKER_35]: That's just not how municipal finance works.

799
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,656
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're never going to have enough money in the future.

800
01:15:36,776 --> 01:15:45,282
[SPEAKER_35]: So I want us to make sure that this project is, sustainability has so many meanings, but is so maintainable.

801
01:15:46,903 --> 01:15:50,925
[SPEAKER_35]: We don't necessarily have the maintenance staff that could do maintenance on a new building.

802
01:15:51,325 --> 01:15:53,226
[SPEAKER_35]: We will have to increase our maintenance department.

803
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:55,608
[SPEAKER_35]: We will have to definitely increase our IT department.

804
01:15:56,048 --> 01:15:56,889
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're going to add

805
01:15:58,045 --> 01:16:04,110
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know how many, but we're going to add numerous additional employees to operate this building.

806
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:10,955
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's on top of what will certainly be massive electric bills compared to what we have now.

807
01:16:11,475 --> 01:16:21,463
[SPEAKER_35]: I electrified my home and I did it knowing full well that the electric bills were going to cause literal panic.

808
01:16:23,605 --> 01:16:24,946
[SPEAKER_35]: And they're brutal.

809
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:26,227
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, I hit $950 a month in the winter.

810
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:33,601
[SPEAKER_35]: For my condo, I have two EVs, so it's a little unfair to compare.

811
01:16:34,902 --> 01:16:41,765
[SPEAKER_35]: So I want us to know that, to remember that everything gets more expensive as time goes on.

812
01:16:43,306 --> 01:16:51,950
[SPEAKER_35]: There's never going to be a shortage of things to spend our municipal dollars on, so it seems to me the cheapest option is to do everything we want now,

813
01:16:53,825 --> 01:17:04,933
[SPEAKER_35]: because we're not going to be able to come back and say, let's add another wing when we're still paying down the debt exclusions.

814
01:17:04,974 --> 01:17:06,375
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'll stop.

815
01:17:06,475 --> 01:17:06,695
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

816
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:08,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paul.

817
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:13,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think cost is obviously at the core of this project.

818
01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:25,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's that the lenses of initial first cost, as well as lifecycle costs that we're going to look at, as well as operating costs, all those things need to be considered as we move forward.

819
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:27,294
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

820
01:17:27,754 --> 01:17:30,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, Nathan, you are up last.

821
01:17:32,978 --> 01:17:33,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

822
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it's been some great feedback from everyone, so I probably won't have anything new to say, but I'll just echo the things that are important to me.

823
01:17:40,464 --> 01:17:50,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when I think about building spaces, I think this is going to be a school first and not a sustainable building first, right?

824
01:17:51,012 --> 01:17:53,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to think about the reliability of it to function as a school.

825
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:58,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we're making decisions, thinking about how do we keep this functional,

826
01:17:59,461 --> 01:18:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Reliable so that we don't get a random 0 degree day and the school can't function because the systems weren't designed to operate at 0 degrees.

827
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:10,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think, you know, the technologies are out there, the trade offs are out there.

828
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:12,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all going to be part of the design process to make sure we have that.

829
01:18:13,908 --> 01:18:17,950
[SPEAKER_05]: But making sure that we're creating a reliable environment for students and the staff.

830
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:22,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I also kind of in the world, I.

831
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:28,741
[SPEAKER_05]: operated in, I think I always did not realize how important envelope is to creating a sustainable building.

832
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of times we think about just, hey, let's have the most sustainable equipment and that type of approach.

833
01:18:36,284 --> 01:18:40,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But really building really tight envelopes, having them operate in a tight way.

834
01:18:40,406 --> 01:18:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a building I was recently involved in that we built a passive house.

835
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you walk by it and see the windows open.

836
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:48,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just completely

837
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:52,532
[SPEAKER_05]: defeats the purpose of making these super efficient walls.

838
01:18:52,592 --> 01:18:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And so not only is it built to that standard, but how is it built in a way that the people who operate it can kind of make sure it actually performs that way.

839
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:05,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really challenging when you then have to kind of educate a much broader community around the right way to operate the building.

840
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:11,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other thing I think a lot of us here are just taxpayers, right?

841
01:19:11,337 --> 01:19:15,999
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a sale that needs to happen to the broader Medford community that I'm sure we'll all probably be advocates for.

842
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:21,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I recently read in the news that Lexington just built a high school for 600 million dollars.

843
01:19:22,062 --> 01:19:25,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just was like, I didn't realize that was a number you could build a school for.

844
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:36,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if that's a number that's going to be a world that we'll have to deal with, but just, you know, feeling that we can defend the decisions that are made of like, yes, this is a lean approach to building a school.

845
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:39,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to give us what we need, but it's not over the top.

846
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,641
[SPEAKER_05]: The specialized stretch code is amazing.

847
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, love it.

848
01:19:45,023 --> 01:19:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: 700 million, even better.

849
01:19:46,884 --> 01:19:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

850
01:19:48,558 --> 01:19:55,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think the specialized stretch code is like, if we can hit that, and which I think obviously we have to, that is success.

851
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:59,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to feel like we have to go above and beyond that, I would not advocate there.

852
01:19:59,303 --> 01:20:07,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think Massachusetts has done a great job of putting out really aggressive standards that are really hard to meet in the world we live in today.

853
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:10,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we can achieve those, then I would be super happy.

854
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:14,430
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, just kind of how do we advocate to the community that

855
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:21,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever the end up ultimate price tag is, it was done in a way that, you know, this is going to be the best fit for this community.

856
01:20:24,204 --> 01:20:24,645
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have.

857
01:20:26,462 --> 01:20:26,822
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

858
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:34,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, great in terms of the diversity of topics that we've covered here.

859
01:20:34,787 --> 01:20:49,235
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we see any gaps after we have a chance to go back and formulate all of these topics, and we will be looking for synergies, organizing them into topics that we'll run through at the following meeting, we'll definitely be sharing those.

860
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:51,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me pull my screen up just one more time.

861
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:54,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Find the right one.

862
01:20:56,951 --> 01:20:57,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we are here.

863
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:05,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone can see that this point.

864
01:21:10,088 --> 01:21:10,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a yes?

865
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:12,129
[SPEAKER_17]: I see a couple of that.

866
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:13,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

867
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:21,374
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, we're going to get back together right after the new year in the middle of January to have some further discussion.

868
01:21:21,894 --> 01:21:30,259
[SPEAKER_17]: That second meeting that we have will involve a little bit more presentation of material in response to some of the topics and the questions, all of the topics.

869
01:21:30,759 --> 01:21:34,062
[SPEAKER_17]: and questions that were presented today, as well as some supplemental ones.

870
01:21:36,423 --> 01:21:37,805
[SPEAKER_17]: These are some of the topics.

871
01:21:37,865 --> 01:21:43,669
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think as you read through this list, you're going to see almost everything that we have discussed here.

872
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:52,756
[SPEAKER_17]: So not to say that this is an exhaustive list, but this is some of the things that we would cover, even if we had not heard about them.

873
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:59,702
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it speaks to the breadth and sort of knowledge of this group that we have touched on all of these as we've gone through.

874
01:22:01,443 --> 01:22:07,166
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, we'll look at whether or not this next meeting on the 15th wants to be remote or hybrid.

875
01:22:07,186 --> 01:22:23,216
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly understand the convenience of an all remote meeting and we value that especially trying to get this activity in before the holiday time and certainly appreciate everyone's time given sort of the premium of various competing interests at this time of year.

876
01:22:24,349 --> 01:22:29,992
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's also something wonderful about being together in person to be able to sort of have these conversations.

877
01:22:30,932 --> 01:22:35,214
[SPEAKER_17]: So whether or not we do fully remote or we do hybrid, we'll sort that out as we go forward.

878
01:22:36,775 --> 01:22:46,059
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, just really appreciate everyone's time today and your thoughts and really look forward to the conversations to come in the subsequent meetings.

879
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you to everybody.

880
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:51,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye y'all.

881
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:52,838
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

882
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,700
[SPEAKER_17]: See you in a few minutes.

883
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless you're staying on for the next meeting, you're welcome to hang around, obviously.

884
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:01,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye, everyone.

885
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:01,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for hosting.

886
01:23:03,148 --> 01:23:03,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye.

887
01:23:03,488 --> 01:23:03,548
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye.

888
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:04,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Nice meeting you all.

889
01:23:04,409 --> 01:23:04,589
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye.

890
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:05,370
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye, everyone.

891
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, everyone that is joining us.

892
01:28:05,924 --> 01:28:13,846
[SPEAKER_17]: We will get going about 535 or so, just to give everyone a chance to hop in.

893
01:28:13,966 --> 01:28:16,706
[SPEAKER_17]: But I definitely appreciate folks jumping on early.

894
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:23,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us has already been hanging around here in this virtual room for an hour and a half.

895
01:28:23,508 --> 01:28:27,469
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to be testing our endurance to keep going for another hour and a half.

896
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:28,809
[SPEAKER_17]: But definitely looking forward to it.

897
01:28:34,002 --> 01:28:37,483
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Ken, are you just keeping the stream going as well from one meeting to the next?

898
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:41,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

899
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:44,486
[SPEAKER_19]: If I stop and start the recording, it still stitches it together anyway, so.

900
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:45,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

901
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:47,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Better not to fight the system.

902
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:47,528
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

903
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:59,012
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to just unplug my computer and move it around to the other side of the table because lo and behold, the little plug that was in the middle of the conference table had no power to it.

904
01:29:00,013 --> 01:29:00,133
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

905
01:29:02,392 --> 01:29:04,010
[SPEAKER_17]: The wall is much better in this regard.

906
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:35,651
[SPEAKER_17]: I do feel like it is my responsibility to break up the awkward silence at the beginning of these meetings, however.

907
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:37,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Because for anyone.

908
01:29:37,692 --> 01:29:38,632
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, I can help you.

909
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:48,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to have to be mobile for part of this meeting with taking my son to a lesson.

910
01:29:49,076 --> 01:29:49,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll have it.

911
01:29:50,736 --> 01:29:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume there's not going to be a ton of swearing.

912
01:29:53,357 --> 01:29:57,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's playing over the car, audio should be.

913
01:29:58,657 --> 01:30:02,538
[SPEAKER_35]: To be fine, so hopefully we are.

914
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:04,519
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't speak for Ken.

915
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:07,499
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know through the last 1 should be fine.

916
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that he hasn't created to drop the phone. 2.

917
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Trying to recall if this was the meeting that someone said that they were only available to start for a certain portion of at the beginning, in which case I might allow them to sort of jump out alphabetical order to be able to share some thoughts if they're around.

918
01:30:39,245 --> 01:30:46,753
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that is anybody that is logged in right now, feel free to chime in and I will adapt things as we're running through the list.

919
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:05,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello to everyone that is joining us.

920
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:11,463
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to give everyone about five minutes just to make sure that we have enough time to log on.

921
01:31:13,444 --> 01:31:17,086
[SPEAKER_17]: But if anyone wants to tell jokes in the meantime, please feel free.

922
01:31:17,647 --> 01:31:18,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Open floor.

923
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:25,711
[SPEAKER_17]: I see a lot of people.

924
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:26,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, go ahead, Paul.

925
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:28,933
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a very revealing request.

926
01:31:28,953 --> 01:31:31,415
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know that I'm not a comedian, so no way.

927
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Non-joke comments are also welcome.

928
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:47,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first rule is you have to know your audience, so until we're all a little more familiar.

929
01:31:49,216 --> 01:31:52,820
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to get through the first meeting first before people are going to feel comfortable with that.

930
01:31:53,361 --> 01:31:55,143
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's probably some wisdom there.

931
01:32:17,838 --> 01:32:20,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny, are you in on all the committee meetings then?

932
01:32:22,722 --> 01:32:33,750
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm trying to sit in on all of these advisory committees just to, I'm like, making my own personal notes about who to call when I have questions about certain things.

933
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:36,292
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm just like, I'm taking it all in.

934
01:32:36,352 --> 01:32:39,595
[SPEAKER_30]: I have no particular expertise in any of these spaces, but.

935
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:49,342
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to be able to like pluck your brains for important things as those decisions come up so that there's more people who can help.

936
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:53,842
[SPEAKER_30]: So more in like reconnaissance mode, but yeah.

937
01:32:54,922 --> 01:33:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel radically underqualified for this committee, so that's good to hear.

938
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:09,285
[SPEAKER_17]: This means that you're an aspirational participant, and we do appreciate that perspective on things.

939
01:33:11,262 --> 01:33:13,404
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I would say no one is underqualified.

940
01:33:13,464 --> 01:33:18,427
[SPEAKER_38]: We need all perspectives are needed and welcomed.

941
01:33:19,768 --> 01:33:29,656
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm so fascinated that every time we have to pick people to do these things, there's so many people in Medford with such interesting qualifications.

942
01:33:30,616 --> 01:33:33,859
[SPEAKER_30]: It's stunning, actually.

943
01:33:34,519 --> 01:33:39,583
[SPEAKER_30]: We just did a meeting about sustainability, and every person that we selected

944
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:49,229
[SPEAKER_30]: Basically works on schools or buildings in sustainability and does carbon neutral things and passive house.

945
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:56,336
[SPEAKER_30]: And literally every buzzword you could think about in the space, somebody there was a leading expert in that thing.

946
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:59,539
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's really fascinating to

947
01:34:01,222 --> 01:34:12,587
[SPEAKER_30]: especially like as a parent, like you get to know people as parents and like you forget that they have like actual professional work life outside of like shuttling kids around to lessons.

948
01:34:12,787 --> 01:34:22,932
[SPEAKER_30]: And so it's always so like interesting and fascinating to like listen to what people's like real expertise is and like how they could put that to work.

949
01:34:23,192 --> 01:34:27,194
[SPEAKER_30]: So yeah, it's pretty, that's like the fun part of this for sure.

950
01:34:31,048 --> 01:34:56,646
[SPEAKER_04]: like, that's, that's been a consistent sort of side effect, but coming with entering the educational community as a parent is like you, especially in Medford, we seem to have like a really wonderful cross section of professions and one professional world that intersect.

951
01:34:56,906 --> 01:34:57,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

952
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:06,173
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I think that's actually a great segue into us getting going.

953
01:35:06,973 --> 01:35:12,016
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am going to try to find the right screen window to share.

954
01:35:12,036 --> 01:35:17,140
[SPEAKER_17]: We will get going with things.

955
01:35:21,767 --> 01:35:35,213
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so hopefully everyone is here today for our exterior and interior design advisory team meeting for the Medford High School project because that is what we're going to be talking about.

956
01:35:37,455 --> 01:35:37,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a quick

957
01:35:38,975 --> 01:35:41,957
[SPEAKER_17]: orientation to what the discussion is going to be today.

958
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:52,061
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go through some general introductions, both of our team, as well as all of the Medford team members on the advisory team.

959
01:35:53,952 --> 01:35:55,993
[SPEAKER_17]: just that we can all get to know each other a little bit.

960
01:35:56,413 --> 01:36:12,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Those will be sort of brief and then we'll have another opportunity later for everyone to get into more description of your individual goals, priority goals and aspirations, or the goals of whatever group, department, commission you might represent.

961
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,501
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll talk a little bit about next steps and sort of how

962
01:36:18,342 --> 01:36:24,824
[SPEAKER_17]: These advisory team meetings fit into the larger context of the project and really sort of what these meetings are.

963
01:36:26,945 --> 01:36:31,986
[SPEAKER_17]: So before we get into that, before we sort of describe the process a bit, we do want to start with the introductions.

964
01:36:32,766 --> 01:36:44,230
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start with our team, and I'm going to apologize again to our OPM team at left field that we won't get some headshots in for you, but we'll let them introduce themselves, and then we'll shift over to the Medford team.

965
01:36:45,503 --> 01:36:47,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to start off, my name is Matt Rice.

966
01:36:47,924 --> 01:36:51,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I am an architect, and I am the principal in charge for SMMA for the project.

967
01:36:53,545 --> 01:37:00,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Helen Fantini, our project manager, she is traveling today, so she's not going to be joining us, but she is a key member of our team.

968
01:37:01,407 --> 01:37:02,868
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'll pass it over to Michael next.

969
01:37:04,188 --> 01:37:04,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everybody.

970
01:37:05,068 --> 01:37:05,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Pardick.

971
01:37:05,768 --> 01:37:08,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an architect and director of design at SMMA.

972
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:10,570
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

973
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:10,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And Lucas?

974
01:37:12,392 --> 01:37:13,112
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, good evening.

975
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:16,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Lucas Carrier, architectural designer at SMMA.

976
01:37:18,815 --> 01:37:19,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sarah?

977
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:21,676
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, everybody.

978
01:37:21,816 --> 01:37:22,697
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm Sarah Long.

979
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:27,639
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm a senior interior designer with SMMA and also a previous Medford resident.

980
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,181
[SPEAKER_17]: You were sad to leave, right?

981
01:37:31,241 --> 01:37:31,961
[SPEAKER_26]: I know.

982
01:37:31,981 --> 01:37:33,742
[SPEAKER_26]: Still touchy.

983
01:37:33,902 --> 01:37:36,443
[SPEAKER_26]: But yes, so very excited to be a part of this process.

984
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:38,324
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and Suela?

985
01:37:39,763 --> 01:37:40,283
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, everyone.

986
01:37:40,383 --> 01:37:41,304
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm Sohla Janka.

987
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:43,204
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm an architectural designer at SMMA.

988
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:44,965
[SPEAKER_34]: Looking forward to the discussion.

989
01:37:46,806 --> 01:37:47,086
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

990
01:37:47,106 --> 01:37:49,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to go through the Leftfield team now.

991
01:37:49,147 --> 01:37:50,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, do you want to start things off?

992
01:37:50,827 --> 01:37:52,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

993
01:37:52,428 --> 01:37:54,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everyone.

994
01:37:54,429 --> 01:37:55,449
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Matt Galino.

995
01:37:55,949 --> 01:37:59,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm one of the project managers for Leftfield, who is your owner's project manager.

996
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:03,332
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be with you for the duration of this project.

997
01:38:04,172 --> 01:38:07,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Also here, I'll hand it off to Jennifer Carlson.

998
01:38:08,504 --> 01:38:10,427
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, I'm Jen Carlson.

999
01:38:10,447 --> 01:38:12,550
[SPEAKER_25]: I am the project director with left field.

1000
01:38:14,052 --> 01:38:18,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that it I think Adele had to jump off for this meeting.

1001
01:38:18,279 --> 01:38:21,563
[SPEAKER_09]: So just the two of us from from left field right now.

1002
01:38:22,308 --> 01:38:22,949
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that.

1003
01:38:23,469 --> 01:38:28,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate all of our team as well, just having their cameras on for the introduction when we go on later.

1004
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:41,892
[SPEAKER_17]: So just a request that if folks are online, unless you're driving or you're sort of on route somewhere and safety is a concern, certainly appreciate just being able to get to see everyone and know everyone as part of this introductory effort.

1005
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:46,546
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me advance the slide to the Medford team.

1006
01:38:47,506 --> 01:38:52,668
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am going to apologize in advance, because I am not going to try and butcher that first name.

1007
01:38:52,688 --> 01:38:57,510
[SPEAKER_17]: And I promise I will find a way to internalize this moving forward.

1008
01:38:57,650 --> 01:39:04,833
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm going to let the first name on that list go first and tell me how to pronounce your name.

1009
01:39:09,187 --> 01:39:15,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless, as did happen at the last meeting, I think as well, we had that individual not here.

1010
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:16,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is, oh.

1011
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:18,991
[SPEAKER_38]: This is one of our students.

1012
01:39:19,812 --> 01:39:20,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, OK.

1013
01:39:20,772 --> 01:39:21,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they on right now or?

1014
01:39:23,373 --> 01:39:29,196
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't think I see her on, but I think we could, the principal's on.

1015
01:39:29,236 --> 01:39:31,897
[SPEAKER_38]: I think between the principal and myself, we can make sure we follow up.

1016
01:39:32,558 --> 01:39:33,498
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, that is great.

1017
01:39:34,507 --> 01:39:46,471
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll also just use this as an opportunity to say everyone will get a certain amount of time, depending on the number of attendees that we have here, to introduce yourself and do some priority goals later.

1018
01:39:47,311 --> 01:39:52,333
[SPEAKER_17]: For anyone that I interrupt as part of the process, because the time has run out,

1019
01:39:53,213 --> 01:39:58,476
[SPEAKER_17]: We certainly welcome any written comments to be submitted to us moving forward.

1020
01:39:58,956 --> 01:40:04,339
[SPEAKER_17]: So that could be another engagement option for anyone that isn't able to be here.

1021
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:07,080
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can make sure that that is communicated out to the group.

1022
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:10,902
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to shift next then to Libby, who I did see.

1023
01:40:14,684 --> 01:40:16,825
[SPEAKER_17]: She just wanted to do a quick introductions here.

1024
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,034
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought I saw Libby.

1025
01:40:30,855 --> 01:40:37,018
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I will circle back if there's AV issues or someone sees her hop on.

1026
01:40:37,878 --> 01:40:39,479
[SPEAKER_17]: She is here.

1027
01:40:39,499 --> 01:40:40,600
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you looking for me?

1028
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:41,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1029
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:42,480
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you hear me?

1030
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1031
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:44,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hear you, yes.

1032
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:44,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1033
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:48,363
[SPEAKER_27]: I realized my mic wasn't working and I clicked something and it kicked me out of the Zoom.

1034
01:40:48,383 --> 01:40:49,364
[SPEAKER_27]: So sorry about that.

1035
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:50,564
[SPEAKER_27]: No problem.

1036
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:52,965
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm introducing myself, I assume?

1037
01:40:53,406 --> 01:40:59,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if you could just introduce yourself and just give a quick connection to the project and sort of what it means to you.

1038
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:00,269
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have more time later.

1039
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:02,187
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'm Libby Brown.

1040
01:41:02,947 --> 01:41:08,690
[SPEAKER_27]: I am a member of the building committee, and I'm a Medford resident, two kids in the schools, and I'm also an architect.

1041
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:12,451
[SPEAKER_27]: So a lot of different angles.

1042
01:41:12,511 --> 01:41:15,273
[SPEAKER_27]: I come at this project with some care and excitement.

1043
01:41:16,373 --> 01:41:16,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1044
01:41:16,733 --> 01:41:17,954
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Alex.

1045
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, can everyone hear me now?

1046
01:41:25,398 --> 01:41:25,998
[SPEAKER_15]: We can, yeah.

1047
01:41:26,658 --> 01:41:26,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1048
01:41:27,639 --> 01:41:28,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Alex Westcoff.

1049
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:30,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Libby, I'm an architect.

1050
01:41:31,598 --> 01:41:35,480
[SPEAKER_06]: with BH plus A in Boston, 45 person firm.

1051
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:43,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also a parent of a Metro Public School student, she's in the eighth grade at the Andrews, and that's me.

1052
01:41:44,984 --> 01:41:45,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1053
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:47,045
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Marta.

1054
01:41:48,115 --> 01:41:49,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Marta Cabral.

1055
01:41:49,055 --> 01:41:50,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the principal here at the high school.

1056
01:41:50,656 --> 01:42:01,418
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my third year here, and I'm really excited to be part of this project to bring teaching and learning to the next level in a new space for our Medford students.

1057
01:42:03,899 --> 01:42:04,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Fantastic.

1058
01:42:05,939 --> 01:42:06,879
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll try with this one.

1059
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:09,880
[SPEAKER_17]: I may butcher it, or go ahead so that I don't do that.

1060
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1061
01:42:14,113 --> 01:42:15,314
[SPEAKER_02]: My background is in architecture.

1062
01:42:15,334 --> 01:42:22,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have two young children that hopefully will be some of the first students to join this building.

1063
01:42:23,517 --> 01:42:24,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very happy to be here.

1064
01:42:25,898 --> 01:42:26,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1065
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:27,519
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Chloe.

1066
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:35,483
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi, I'm Chloe Darsalis, and I'm a student in Medford High School.

1067
01:42:38,038 --> 01:42:53,116
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to be a part of this project because I want to make this space an exclusive space and community for teenagers alike, no matter race, gender, or anything that has to do with youth.

1068
01:42:55,308 --> 01:42:56,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for joining us, Chloe.

1069
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:58,813
[SPEAKER_17]: We really do appreciate student voice.

1070
01:42:58,913 --> 01:43:06,584
[SPEAKER_17]: I think maybe above and beyond everyone is important in this, but certainly the primary users of the building are critical.

1071
01:43:06,804 --> 01:43:07,866
[SPEAKER_17]: So appreciate you here.

1072
01:43:09,426 --> 01:43:09,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul.

1073
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:23,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Paul Ellis, lifelong Metro resident, probably entered the existing high school in its second year of existence back in 72 probably.

1074
01:43:23,736 --> 01:43:27,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've gone through the that the original high school when it first opened.

1075
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I retired a few years ago from Fidelity Investments.

1076
01:43:31,801 --> 01:43:35,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked as a software and hardware quality assurance.

1077
01:43:35,804 --> 01:43:37,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I did that for 40 years before I retired.

1078
01:43:38,385 --> 01:43:44,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So first job was working, testing CAD CAM software way back when.

1079
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:51,333
[SPEAKER_08]: My two children went through, one graduated in 2012, the other one graduated in 2016.

1080
01:43:51,494 --> 01:43:56,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of have a feel for pickup and drop-offs at the existing method high.

1081
01:43:56,977 --> 01:43:58,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of experience with that.

1082
01:43:59,062 --> 01:44:01,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And one was in the marching band.

1083
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:08,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have an experience with them trying to store equipment and accessing rooms to do their practicing.

1084
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:17,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And my other daughter, my daughter was in the orchestra and they kind of had the same experience of extracurricular and making sure that there's room for.

1085
01:44:17,696 --> 01:44:28,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So being a long time after resident, my goal is hopefully we get a school that lasts another 50 years like this one did, except maybe not the,

1086
01:44:29,592 --> 01:44:37,459
[SPEAKER_08]: as much concrete maybe on the outside, but I just want to throw my experience being here forever into the school.

1087
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Really appreciate that perspective.

1088
01:44:40,241 --> 01:44:41,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Suzanne.

1089
01:44:44,215 --> 01:44:46,477
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, well, hi, nice to meet everybody.

1090
01:44:46,497 --> 01:44:47,598
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm Susan Galussi.

1091
01:44:47,618 --> 01:44:49,079
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm the interim superintendent.

1092
01:44:50,981 --> 01:44:52,662
[SPEAKER_38]: I have come a little bit full circle.

1093
01:44:52,762 --> 01:44:54,643
[SPEAKER_38]: I did grow up here in Medford.

1094
01:44:55,024 --> 01:44:57,466
[SPEAKER_38]: I went product of Medford Public Schools.

1095
01:44:58,266 --> 01:44:59,427
[SPEAKER_38]: My whole career has been here.

1096
01:44:59,868 --> 01:45:01,149
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm on my 29th year.

1097
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:03,591
[SPEAKER_38]: So I was an educator for 15 years.

1098
01:45:03,611 --> 01:45:05,932
[SPEAKER_38]: I was part of when the

1099
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:21,459
[SPEAKER_38]: new buildings opened and I taught over at the McGlynn for 11 years and then I moved into school leadership at the Brooks for eight years and moved up here to central office during COVID.

1100
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:29,384
[SPEAKER_38]: So I definitely am extremely committed not only to the community but to this

1101
01:45:30,906 --> 01:45:40,860
[SPEAKER_38]: project to what it means for not only our Medford High School students and our staff, but also to the community at large as our flagship school.

1102
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:45,506
[SPEAKER_38]: And, you know, we take a lot of pride in using our schools as community spaces.

1103
01:45:45,607 --> 01:45:47,029
[SPEAKER_38]: So really being able to

1104
01:45:48,449 --> 01:45:59,394
[SPEAKER_38]: have some input on what we want and hope for this building to look like and feel like as a community space is really exciting.

1105
01:46:00,054 --> 01:46:01,975
[SPEAKER_38]: I do want to kind of apologize ahead of time.

1106
01:46:02,035 --> 01:46:04,256
[SPEAKER_38]: I am slightly double booked tonight.

1107
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,698
[SPEAKER_38]: I will be switching to my phone momentarily.

1108
01:46:06,718 --> 01:46:12,380
[SPEAKER_38]: I have the after school task force meeting at about six o'clock.

1109
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,381
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm not going to be able to stay for the whole thing.

1110
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:18,003
[SPEAKER_38]: So I do apologize for having to duck out a little early.

1111
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:28,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we'll see if we can, maybe if we get to that point and it's 555 and we're jumping into priority goals, we might give you that poll position in terms of going first.

1112
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:30,238
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see what we can do there.

1113
01:46:31,019 --> 01:46:31,399
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1114
01:46:31,419 --> 01:46:32,179
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1115
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:33,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny.

1116
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,461
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey everyone, I'm Jenny Graham.

1117
01:46:35,501 --> 01:46:41,844
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee and the vice chair of the school committee.

1118
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,425
[SPEAKER_30]: I have two high school students this year.

1119
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:45,366
[SPEAKER_30]: One is a junior

1120
01:46:46,443 --> 01:46:53,093
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, who is in a vocational program and the other is a freshman who I believe will be in a vocational program.

1121
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:55,717
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, if the lottery goes his way.

1122
01:46:56,652 --> 01:47:01,014
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm really excited to learn from all of you.

1123
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:06,997
[SPEAKER_30]: There's four of these advisory committees, and I get to be on all of them.

1124
01:47:07,497 --> 01:47:24,325
[SPEAKER_30]: And my goal here, as I was mentioning earlier, is just to learn about the skills of our super talented community and understand from all of you the kinds of things that you're thinking about so that as we go forward and the pace of decision making

1125
01:47:25,726 --> 01:47:43,392
[SPEAKER_30]: sort of speeds up as it inevitably will, that we can call on you all to help us make good decisions about future forward building and navigate what's hard about that.

1126
01:47:43,512 --> 01:47:50,154
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think I'm really excited for this project, obviously, but also to hear from all of you.

1127
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:52,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1128
01:47:54,938 --> 01:47:55,638
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Brian.

1129
01:47:55,658 --> 01:47:56,938
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're up next.

1130
01:47:57,998 --> 01:47:58,278
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1131
01:47:58,779 --> 01:47:59,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Can everybody hear me?

1132
01:48:00,619 --> 01:48:00,979
[SPEAKER_20]: We can.

1133
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:01,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Excellent.

1134
01:48:02,659 --> 01:48:03,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice to see everybody.

1135
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,660
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pretty excited to be here as well.

1136
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:10,521
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm a parent, live in Medford.

1137
01:48:11,082 --> 01:48:13,482
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a son who's at the high school now.

1138
01:48:14,122 --> 01:48:15,483
[SPEAKER_20]: He's also in the vocational.

1139
01:48:17,847 --> 01:48:21,650
[SPEAKER_20]: world and really enjoying the CTE, so I'm a huge advocate for that.

1140
01:48:23,031 --> 01:48:34,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, I'm a member of the building committee, the school building committee, so I've been following this through for the length of it, and it's pretty exciting to see where we're headed.

1141
01:48:35,159 --> 01:48:44,586
[SPEAKER_20]: And probably least importantly, I'm also an architect, but I've got a history in a prior life of doing a lot of design work with

1142
01:48:45,326 --> 01:48:46,708
[SPEAKER_20]: public school building.

1143
01:48:46,808 --> 01:48:52,433
[SPEAKER_20]: So I also feel like this is a great place to be, to be on the other end of it.

1144
01:48:52,814 --> 01:48:55,937
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, like I said, super excited to see where we end up.

1145
01:48:56,057 --> 01:49:00,541
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know it's a long and rigorous process, but we've got a good team.

1146
01:49:00,581 --> 01:49:02,443
[SPEAKER_20]: So happy to be here.

1147
01:49:03,804 --> 01:49:04,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1148
01:49:04,065 --> 01:49:04,425
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1149
01:49:04,445 --> 01:49:05,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Din.

1150
01:49:12,819 --> 01:49:12,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope.

1151
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:13,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1152
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I see Ken is shaking his head.

1153
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,740
[SPEAKER_17]: I think just because he wants to go next.

1154
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:18,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, absolutely.

1155
01:49:19,621 --> 01:49:20,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Ken Lord.

1156
01:49:20,201 --> 01:49:22,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the chief operations officer of the Medford schools.

1157
01:49:23,421 --> 01:49:24,882
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also a member of the school building committee.

1158
01:49:25,182 --> 01:49:28,343
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in charge of facilities, technology, and security for the district.

1159
01:49:29,623 --> 01:49:30,183
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1160
01:49:30,283 --> 01:49:30,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ken.

1161
01:49:32,263 --> 01:49:32,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Nicole.

1162
01:49:39,025 --> 01:49:39,325
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1163
01:49:41,385 --> 01:49:51,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, as I said during the last meeting, it's not the end of the world if people are not here at the beginning, both because we can get feedback afterwards, but also give everybody a little bit more time as we get into talking about priority goals.

1164
01:49:51,962 --> 01:49:54,767
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Jen.

1165
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:57,699
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, I'm Jen Regano.

1166
01:49:58,059 --> 01:50:00,780
[SPEAKER_36]: I am a teacher at Medford High School.

1167
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,381
[SPEAKER_36]: I've taught math there for 18 years now.

1168
01:50:05,381 --> 01:50:14,785
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm also a parent of a, my daughter graduated last year from Medford High and I have an eighth grader, a sixth grader and a fourth grader.

1169
01:50:14,825 --> 01:50:18,066
[SPEAKER_36]: So hopefully maybe getting into the new building.

1170
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:23,948
[SPEAKER_36]: We'll see with my students, but certainly as a teacher, I will be using the building quite a bit.

1171
01:50:26,097 --> 01:50:26,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent, thank you.

1172
01:50:28,283 --> 01:50:28,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul.

1173
01:50:31,712 --> 01:50:33,576
[SPEAKER_35]: All righty, Paul Rousseau.

1174
01:50:34,695 --> 01:50:37,336
[SPEAKER_35]: on the school building committee as a non-voting member.

1175
01:50:37,456 --> 01:50:47,559
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm my fourth term on the school committee and my kids, well, my daughter's a senior at Medford High and my son has graduated already.

1176
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:58,023
[SPEAKER_35]: So it's way too late for my kids, but so I'm just beyond excited about this project and glad to see we're moving.

1177
01:50:59,017 --> 01:50:59,978
[SPEAKER_35]: So thank you all.

1178
01:51:00,138 --> 01:51:09,282
[SPEAKER_35]: And I want to reiterate something Jenny said earlier about like, and I text her sometimes while we're in these meetings and I'm like, can you believe these people live in Medford?

1179
01:51:09,362 --> 01:51:12,284
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, you know, it's like, I don't know.

1180
01:51:12,344 --> 01:51:19,468
[SPEAKER_35]: I feel like we're less connected to our neighbors than, well, we are in fact less connected to our neighbors, especially if you're not from here.

1181
01:51:20,228 --> 01:51:23,510
[SPEAKER_35]: And like the expertise that is just like,

1182
01:51:24,872 --> 01:51:25,473
[SPEAKER_35]: everywhere.

1183
01:51:25,853 --> 01:51:27,075
[SPEAKER_35]: It's shocking to me.

1184
01:51:27,355 --> 01:51:29,658
[SPEAKER_35]: And I feel really I grew up in rural New Hampshire.

1185
01:51:29,738 --> 01:51:35,765
[SPEAKER_35]: And I can tell you, this would not have been the experience if the members of my little tiny town had gotten together to do this work.

1186
01:51:35,885 --> 01:51:37,707
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is great stuff.

1187
01:51:37,808 --> 01:51:38,148
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1188
01:51:38,168 --> 01:51:39,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Paul.

1189
01:51:40,851 --> 01:51:41,352
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Delia.

1190
01:51:48,244 --> 01:51:49,704
[SPEAKER_28]: I think Jesse was ahead of me.

1191
01:51:49,724 --> 01:51:52,565
[SPEAKER_28]: Did Jesse want to go or did he already on the list at least?

1192
01:51:52,645 --> 01:51:53,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1193
01:51:53,245 --> 01:51:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

1194
01:51:54,826 --> 01:51:55,606
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't want to skip the line.

1195
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:58,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse, go ahead.

1196
01:51:58,187 --> 01:52:02,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Julia.

1197
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:06,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Jesse, a 15-year Medford resident.

1198
01:52:06,729 --> 01:52:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a freshman at the high school, a son, and a son in fifth grade at Brooks.

1199
01:52:14,091 --> 01:52:16,112
[SPEAKER_04]: We were starting off when Miss Galussi was at Brooks.

1200
01:52:18,193 --> 01:52:21,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I am an architect admirer.

1201
01:52:22,455 --> 01:52:32,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it almost a whole semester as a freshman in architecture, but wound up in a different area of the arts.

1202
01:52:32,299 --> 01:52:45,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a professor at MassArt in Boston, teaching animation, but still really love design, love Medford, and have

1203
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: greatly enjoyed watching the town grow and getting to know my community through the schools and the families involved in the schools.

1204
01:52:56,889 --> 01:53:02,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm honored to be able to be in any capacity a part of this project.

1205
01:53:05,075 --> 01:53:05,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks so much, Jesse.

1206
01:53:05,816 --> 01:53:07,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Apologies there for jumping past you.

1207
01:53:08,378 --> 01:53:08,778
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1208
01:53:08,798 --> 01:53:10,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Delia, for redirecting me.

1209
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:13,019
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1210
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:14,381
[SPEAKER_28]: No worries, I can jump in.

1211
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:15,822
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Delia Wendell.

1212
01:53:15,842 --> 01:53:16,482
[SPEAKER_28]: Delia.

1213
01:53:16,963 --> 01:53:17,864
[SPEAKER_28]: No, yeah, that's fine.

1214
01:53:19,265 --> 01:53:24,369
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm an architect by training, and I teach now in faculty at MIT.

1215
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:29,073
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think I know Soala, or at least I know of you.

1216
01:53:30,174 --> 01:53:38,822
[SPEAKER_28]: I teach in the urban studies and planning department, where my specialty is in community-led planning and design.

1217
01:53:39,605 --> 01:53:40,346
[SPEAKER_28]: and peace building.

1218
01:53:41,146 --> 01:53:42,687
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm very excited to be part of this.

1219
01:53:42,767 --> 01:53:45,790
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, and I should say, I have a kindergartner who just started at Brooks.

1220
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:50,273
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a vested interest here and an infant who has left me sleep deprived.

1221
01:53:51,534 --> 01:53:54,617
[SPEAKER_28]: So hopefully we'll take full advantage of the new high school building.

1222
01:53:54,757 --> 01:53:55,697
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm very excited to be here.

1223
01:53:56,098 --> 01:53:56,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for including me.

1224
01:53:58,279 --> 01:53:58,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1225
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:00,001
[SPEAKER_17]: And Eric.

1226
01:54:00,878 --> 01:54:02,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I was glad to hear this was alphabetical.

1227
01:54:02,318 --> 01:54:02,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1228
01:54:02,779 --> 01:54:03,959
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Eric Zeckman.

1229
01:54:04,999 --> 01:54:06,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I have two children here in Medford.

1230
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:11,561
[SPEAKER_10]: One is in fourth grade at the Brooks, and my daughter is in the kids corner at the high school.

1231
01:54:11,641 --> 01:54:15,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are dealing with a lot of the transportation issues that people have mentioned earlier.

1232
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:17,863
[SPEAKER_10]: By trade, I'm in higher education.

1233
01:54:18,023 --> 01:54:22,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I've worked on the academic side of the house and in college athletics over at BC.

1234
01:54:23,225 --> 01:54:27,046
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just excited to participate and learn about what we're going to do.

1235
01:54:27,066 --> 01:54:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exciting.

1236
01:54:28,647 --> 01:54:28,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1237
01:54:29,765 --> 01:54:30,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Fantastic.

1238
01:54:30,285 --> 01:54:34,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone on that I have not listed here that is participating?

1239
01:54:34,327 --> 01:54:37,708
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1240
01:54:37,748 --> 01:54:38,349
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good sign.

1241
01:54:38,369 --> 01:54:42,470
[SPEAKER_17]: That means the process is working and that we figured out at least the signup process.

1242
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:43,271
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a great thing.

1243
01:54:44,431 --> 01:54:49,093
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I'm going to give just a quick orientation here in terms of what we're doing.

1244
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:55,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And really like what, what is this advisory team meeting that is going on that we're all participating in.

1245
01:54:56,075 --> 01:55:04,942
[SPEAKER_17]: And we know that there's a lot of meetings going on for the project right now in a lot of different areas in some cases it can be meeting, maybe meeting overload.

1246
01:55:06,242 --> 01:55:22,927
[SPEAKER_17]: But this thread of meetings is something that we found to be critically important and valuable in terms of really bringing together a diverse set of stakeholder voices from across the entire Bedford community.

1247
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:40,070
[SPEAKER_17]: The challenge that we have when thinking about the design of the project is that there is all this expertise that exists in various corners, and we need to find a way, not just for us as the design team to hear those voices,

1248
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:54,574
[SPEAKER_17]: But for the voices to hear themselves, right, there's as much to be gained from all of you listening to your varied perspectives and being able to dialogue on those types of things, because that's really what's going to allow us to build consensus support for the project moving forward.

1249
01:55:55,435 --> 01:56:05,498
[SPEAKER_17]: So while the collection of the advisory team meetings is intended to sort of push forward generally the design process,

1250
01:56:06,258 --> 01:56:11,742
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also getting sort of this critical interchange and exchange of ideas as we move forward.

1251
01:56:13,043 --> 01:56:26,973
[SPEAKER_17]: So this particular advisory team, exterior-interior design, is really part of a collection of four different advisory team threads that are going to be carried out over the course of the beginning of the project here.

1252
01:56:27,993 --> 01:56:31,495
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's important to note that these are not individual silos of discussion.

1253
01:56:32,015 --> 01:56:40,438
[SPEAKER_17]: The Venn diagram that you see on the screen is really intentional because these are not discrete, isolated topics that we're going to be reviewing.

1254
01:56:40,878 --> 01:56:50,082
[SPEAKER_17]: There is very much, when we talk about exterior and interior design, whether we're talking about educational planning, site safety, security, sustainability, all these things are connected, right?

1255
01:56:51,202 --> 01:57:00,507
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, if we just sort of open up the entire playbook and say we're just going to be talking about all of it, we're really not going to be able to have deep, substantive conversations.

1256
01:57:01,307 --> 01:57:06,130
[SPEAKER_17]: So what this allows us to do is really give space to each individual topic.

1257
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:13,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we actually do have a lot of overlapping participation from various members which will help to bring that connectivity.

1258
01:57:14,393 --> 01:57:31,161
[SPEAKER_17]: But eventually what we're going to produce from this course of meetings from every individual advisory team meeting is a set of recommendations that's going to get forwarded to the full building committee for approval incorporation to the project.

1259
01:57:31,181 --> 01:57:33,082
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the way that this mechanism is going to work.

1260
01:57:33,902 --> 01:57:35,725
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of pulling everyone's voices together.

1261
01:57:35,745 --> 01:57:44,515
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to listen to you today, and we're going to have some dialogue on each of the topics, and really try to find some common ground as we move forward.

1262
01:57:47,485 --> 01:58:00,312
[SPEAKER_17]: overall objective for this particular advisory team is really thinking about both exterior design considerations as well as interior design considerations, right?

1263
01:58:00,392 --> 01:58:03,694
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's in some ways design is a nebulous topic, right?

1264
01:58:03,774 --> 01:58:08,357
[SPEAKER_17]: It covers a lot of different aspects in terms of when people mention it and what we're thinking about.

1265
01:58:09,117 --> 01:58:15,061
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really maybe the beauty of it, right, that it touches on so many different aspects of how we conceive of a project.

1266
01:58:15,741 --> 01:58:25,348
[SPEAKER_17]: I think specifically the thoughts here are going to revolve around both materiality and aesthetics, but also in terms of space.

1267
01:58:26,468 --> 01:58:31,652
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we think about those aspects, we'd love to have people sort of guided in those directions.

1268
01:58:32,053 --> 01:58:41,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, if there's something that's outside those guardrails that you want, you just feel compelled to talk about, we're not going to restrict that type of conversation.

1269
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:47,825
[SPEAKER_17]: But we just want to let everyone know sort of generally what, where we're aiming to sort of collect feedback from this team.

1270
01:58:49,344 --> 01:59:00,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just in terms of overall process, we do have a series of four different meetings that we are going to be engaging with each of the teams.

1271
01:59:00,678 --> 01:59:06,325
[SPEAKER_17]: The second one, which is really our review and respond meeting, is scheduled for the middle of January.

1272
01:59:07,077 --> 01:59:09,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so we'll be doing that moving forward.

1273
01:59:09,499 --> 01:59:22,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and then there's, um, subsequent conversations as well that we need to, um, settle on the schedule for, but, um, when we think about the overall timeline, uh, for the project, um, some folks have seen this are familiar with it.

1274
01:59:22,268 --> 01:59:29,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but for those of you that have not seen it, um, our overall project timeline has the building opening, um, really in the fall of 2030.

1275
01:59:30,522 --> 01:59:32,583
[SPEAKER_17]: That is our goal to the right-hand side.

1276
01:59:32,603 --> 01:59:39,847
[SPEAKER_17]: To the left-hand side is where we are currently today in terms of the really in the initial portions of the feasibility study.

1277
01:59:40,627 --> 01:59:49,972
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can see the stars here really indicate the touch points for our advisory team meeting discussions that are going to be happening at the beginning of the project again today.

1278
01:59:50,432 --> 02:00:00,265
[SPEAKER_17]: the listening session, and then we'll be following up in the middle of January with the subsequent meeting, but extending all the way out really into the fall of 2026.

1279
02:00:03,997 --> 02:00:16,350
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just very briefly, in terms of framing the design process, and I know that we do have a lot of design professionals as part of this particular team, which is amazing.

1280
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:23,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when I say that the design process is not a linear one, I think everyone will understand that.

1281
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:29,980
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an inherent sort of wonderful messiness about the design process, right?

1282
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:37,003
[SPEAKER_17]: But we do like to think about these various activities that sort of define the process across the course of things.

1283
02:00:37,663 --> 02:00:39,804
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not to say that this is linear in any nature.

1284
02:00:39,864 --> 02:00:44,925
[SPEAKER_17]: There's certainly going back and rethinking based on various pieces of input.

1285
02:00:45,926 --> 02:00:52,088
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think where we are at the beginning right now is really in this empathy and definition sort of world.

1286
02:00:53,048 --> 02:00:54,509
[SPEAKER_17]: where we're going to operate right now.

1287
02:00:54,590 --> 02:01:00,154
[SPEAKER_17]: And as we move forward, we'll certainly start to engage in some of the other parts and pieces of the process.

1288
02:01:00,934 --> 02:01:11,702
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just want to try to encourage us at this point in time to think big and really understand that there have been no sort of finite plans that have been developed at this point.

1289
02:01:11,742 --> 02:01:18,768
[SPEAKER_17]: We're really using this collection of meetings, both the advisory team, as well as the educational visioning, as educational programming,

1290
02:01:19,688 --> 02:01:24,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, these are all the parts and pieces that are helping to inform our process moving forward.

1291
02:01:25,689 --> 02:01:30,190
[SPEAKER_17]: And so just to try to reiterate maybe the creative messiness associated with it.

1292
02:01:33,631 --> 02:01:40,752
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so this is where I'm going to pull down the slideshow.

1293
02:01:40,792 --> 02:01:44,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to look at where we are right now, and I'm just going to

1294
02:01:47,275 --> 02:01:51,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have about 15 members here if I was counting correctly.

1295
02:01:52,199 --> 02:02:02,047
[SPEAKER_17]: So we should each have about four minutes to go through and I'll just advise folks that if you get to the four minutes and you're still talking I will probably interrupt you.

1296
02:02:03,148 --> 02:02:13,355
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll say probably because we went through the entire last meeting and I didn't have to interrupt anybody but it's also because some folks were a little bit more brief up front and it gave a little bit more space to folks towards the end.

1297
02:02:13,375 --> 02:02:14,016
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing

1298
02:02:15,537 --> 02:02:16,698
[SPEAKER_17]: premeditated about that.

1299
02:02:16,738 --> 02:02:18,318
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just how the alphabet works out.

1300
02:02:18,358 --> 02:02:19,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we'll flip things around.

1301
02:02:19,839 --> 02:02:27,763
[SPEAKER_17]: And I see that Suzanne just had to hop off, so maybe we'll get a little bit more than the four minutes now in terms of pieces.

1302
02:02:27,803 --> 02:02:41,070
[SPEAKER_17]: But if I do end up having to cut you off, just I'll reiterate the offer, the opportunity to have folks submit anything written after the fact in terms of being able to allow us to consider it.

1303
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:51,935
[SPEAKER_17]: moving forward as part of the conversation and part of topics that want to be covered as we get to subsequent meetings in each of the advisory team threads.

1304
02:02:52,396 --> 02:02:57,518
[SPEAKER_17]: So, with that, let me get back to my list.

1305
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,501
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we're going to start off with Libby.

1306
02:03:02,521 --> 02:03:06,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will just start our timer.

1307
02:03:08,064 --> 02:03:09,645
[SPEAKER_27]: I will try to cut myself off at four minutes.

1308
02:03:09,945 --> 02:03:13,907
[SPEAKER_27]: So I should just be selling you sort of the goals and things I bring to this, right?

1309
02:03:14,847 --> 02:03:15,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1310
02:03:15,307 --> 02:03:16,148
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, priority goals.

1311
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:27,172
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's things that you would love to see considered as part of the project moving forward, again, I think sort of through that lens of thinking about exterior interior design.

1312
02:03:28,073 --> 02:03:31,975
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, if you need to branch out somewhere from there, I think that's okay.

1313
02:03:31,995 --> 02:03:33,115
[SPEAKER_27]: I can say plenty about those two.

1314
02:03:33,575 --> 02:03:33,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1315
02:03:33,995 --> 02:03:34,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

1316
02:03:34,936 --> 02:03:35,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

1317
02:03:36,096 --> 02:03:37,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, sort of in terms of

1318
02:03:37,797 --> 02:03:38,919
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll start with exterior.

1319
02:03:38,999 --> 02:03:45,045
[SPEAKER_27]: So I, something I work, you know, half my life is spent just, you know, massing and selecting materials.

1320
02:03:46,066 --> 02:03:52,994
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would really hope for Medford, something we're focusing on is simplicity, longevity, timeless design.

1321
02:03:53,014 --> 02:03:54,235
[SPEAKER_27]: We kind of do more with less.

1322
02:03:54,255 --> 02:03:57,078
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, this building is going to be around for a long time.

1323
02:03:57,339 --> 02:03:58,420
[SPEAKER_27]: It might not get

1324
02:03:59,128 --> 02:04:05,211
[SPEAKER_27]: the maintenance it requires, um, unless, you know, we find more money down the road to maintain our buildings.

1325
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:10,454
[SPEAKER_27]: So, um, you know, simplicity and, you know, using simple materials.

1326
02:04:10,534 --> 02:04:13,115
[SPEAKER_27]: I think taking the existing building as a real, um,

1327
02:04:14,913 --> 02:04:19,096
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I imagine there's probably a world where some of this building is going to stay.

1328
02:04:19,116 --> 02:04:23,638
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we should be thinking about how these things go together.

1329
02:04:23,658 --> 02:04:25,960
[SPEAKER_27]: Is there inspiration to take from the existing building?

1330
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:31,123
[SPEAKER_27]: I think brick and concrete are pretty timeless themselves, and I've said this to several people.

1331
02:04:31,143 --> 02:04:34,805
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually am very fond of certain elements of the building.

1332
02:04:34,845 --> 02:04:36,346
[SPEAKER_27]: I know a lot of people find it quite ugly.

1333
02:04:36,786 --> 02:04:39,848
[SPEAKER_27]: Certain parts of it are not great, but I think there's a lot to be learned from it.

1334
02:04:40,808 --> 02:04:49,590
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's a good starting point, and certainly just like simplicity, not adding a lot of different materials for the sake of adding more.

1335
02:04:49,610 --> 02:05:05,134
[SPEAKER_27]: On the interior, I'm the chair of my office's materials task force, so I spend a lot of time talking about healthy materials, and certainly within the breathable space within the envelope of the building, if we could be, you know, red list free as a baseline across the building.

1336
02:05:05,894 --> 02:05:09,096
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think PVC has a place inside the building.

1337
02:05:10,477 --> 02:05:25,747
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we could be looking at things that are durable, timeless, and still really taking into consideration the health and well-being of the occupants when that really goes to students whose bodies are still developing and absorbing things around them.

1338
02:05:26,823 --> 02:05:32,827
[SPEAKER_27]: the teachers and staff, the people who spend decades inside the building and for whom their health care for our city pays for.

1339
02:05:32,927 --> 02:05:40,592
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think the occupant health and wellness is critical and that should really drive some of the decisions made about definitely interior materials.

1340
02:05:41,273 --> 02:05:50,519
[SPEAKER_27]: And also just things like trying not to be trendy, simplifying the palette, not adding materials where we don't need to add them just for decorative reasons.

1341
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:53,521
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe they should be serving a purpose like acoustics or

1342
02:05:55,383 --> 02:05:59,445
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, to soften a space or, you know, define a different area.

1343
02:05:59,485 --> 02:06:05,308
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think being really careful about how we're selecting things and making sure that they have a real reason to be there.

1344
02:06:05,829 --> 02:06:09,150
[SPEAKER_27]: I could go on forever, but I'm going to hold on.

1345
02:06:09,671 --> 02:06:14,834
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think those are my biggest things are just, you know, I know what to think about maintenance and things that are going to last the test of time.

1346
02:06:15,334 --> 02:06:22,978
[SPEAKER_27]: But let's not let that lead us down the path of sometimes the more expected materials like vinyl and things like that.

1347
02:06:24,908 --> 02:06:25,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1348
02:06:25,288 --> 02:06:34,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, no, I think you're pointing to some of those overlaps that I was mentioning earlier, certainly between the larger topic of sustainability and material selection.

1349
02:06:34,831 --> 02:06:38,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's something that we'll definitely dive into at a good level of detail.

1350
02:06:40,813 --> 02:06:43,414
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let me jump back then.

1351
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:47,456
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Alex.

1352
02:06:51,877 --> 02:06:52,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, hi, here.

1353
02:06:53,938 --> 02:06:54,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone can hear?

1354
02:06:55,145 --> 02:06:55,825
[SPEAKER_17]: We can, yep.

1355
02:06:56,506 --> 02:07:00,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So great, Libby, I think you set the table really well.

1356
02:07:02,868 --> 02:07:05,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the things I was gonna talk about were some of the things that you already mentioned.

1357
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:17,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I can also be a fan of concrete and brick, because it does have longevity, but it's not to everyone's taste necessarily, and the existing building kind of testifies to that brutalist nature.

1358
02:07:21,116 --> 02:07:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my big,

1359
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:32,355
[SPEAKER_06]: functions in my professional career is construction, administration and management, and cost analysis.

1360
02:07:32,815 --> 02:07:44,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the topic of materials, their value for money, value engineering is extremely important.

1361
02:07:44,282 --> 02:07:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what can you do?

1362
02:07:46,043 --> 02:07:47,864
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you do more with a little bit less?

1363
02:07:47,984 --> 02:07:50,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it always comes down to money at the end of the day, unfortunately.

1364
02:07:53,263 --> 02:07:57,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Sustainability is a huge issue as well these days, rightly so.

1365
02:08:00,045 --> 02:08:10,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mainly working in multifamily residential affordable housing these days, but I have history in academic science, that kind of thing.

1366
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:18,090
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, sustainability in residential construction and in all construction these days is really key.

1367
02:08:18,978 --> 02:08:21,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we gonna go for passive house?

1368
02:08:21,339 --> 02:08:22,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we gonna go for LEED?

1369
02:08:22,779 --> 02:08:24,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we gonna go for this, that or the other?

1370
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:26,560
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get that on board early?

1371
02:08:28,501 --> 02:08:33,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring in any consultants that we need to do for energy modeling and so on and so forth.

1372
02:08:35,783 --> 02:08:39,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely appreciate what Libby said about environmentally friendly materials.

1373
02:08:40,025 --> 02:08:47,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Vinyl is definitely not environmentally friendly and there are many alternate materials for finishes and such that,

1374
02:08:48,692 --> 02:08:49,593
[SPEAKER_06]: are much more healthy.

1375
02:08:53,995 --> 02:09:00,779
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of overall composition and massing, I mean, that's a discussion that you're gonna have for days, months, and years probably.

1376
02:09:03,201 --> 02:09:05,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also think it's extremely important.

1377
02:09:05,322 --> 02:09:08,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you have an OPM on board now, which is great.

1378
02:09:08,844 --> 02:09:14,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how this is gonna be bid, whether it's gonna be a 149 or whether it's gonna be a private bid.

1379
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: CMs are invaluable at the earliest possible stages that you can have them on board, because I think they have a better ear to the street in terms of cost and availability of materials and just experience in building.

1380
02:09:32,602 --> 02:09:37,466
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would certainly push for that as soon as possible.

1381
02:09:41,989 --> 02:09:44,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I've got 25 years of experience in this industry,

1382
02:09:45,406 --> 02:09:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of construction involvement, so I'm happy to sort of overlap different groups like sustainability, MEP, that kind of thing.

1383
02:09:53,892 --> 02:09:55,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for having me.

1384
02:09:57,074 --> 02:09:58,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Alex, just real quick on that.

1385
02:09:58,555 --> 02:10:00,456
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Matt Colino from left field.

1386
02:10:00,757 --> 02:10:01,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having camera issues.

1387
02:10:02,258 --> 02:10:03,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.

1388
02:10:03,979 --> 02:10:04,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1389
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:06,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we will certainly go 149, 149A.

1390
02:10:08,813 --> 02:10:24,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, likely likely one for Diana, given the complex complexity of the project, obviously we have a little ways to go before we make that decision, but you know, given the type of project, that's likely the, the road would go on and we certainly wouldn't bring them on during schematic design.

1391
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:31,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you looking at this as being an MSBA project cloud sub bid?

1392
02:10:33,187 --> 02:10:33,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yes.

1393
02:10:34,007 --> 02:10:37,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and just not to, not to hijack the meeting.

1394
02:10:37,568 --> 02:10:39,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I can certainly talk to you offline.

1395
02:10:39,909 --> 02:10:44,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to, um, get in the weeds with this type of stuff now, but I just wanted to chime in quickly.

1396
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:46,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll hand it back over to you, Matt.

1397
02:10:47,291 --> 02:11:00,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's important and I'm not trying to hijack this either, but I think, um, at some point we need to make what this bureaucratic process is extremely explicit to all involved because it's complicated and

1398
02:11:01,178 --> 02:11:03,458
[SPEAKER_06]: it can sometimes cause a lot of confusion.

1399
02:11:03,578 --> 02:11:06,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's an agenda item for possibly the next meeting.

1400
02:11:08,219 --> 02:11:09,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, completely agree.

1401
02:11:09,339 --> 02:11:10,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Explicit, transparent as well.

1402
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:18,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think procurement is one of those sort of design-adjacent topics that we can certainly dive into a bit as we go forward.

1403
02:11:19,201 --> 02:11:23,182
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to apologize now, because I said I was going to do something and I did not.

1404
02:11:23,662 --> 02:11:25,562
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that Suzanne had to hop off.

1405
02:11:25,642 --> 02:11:29,623
[SPEAKER_17]: But see, Jesse has his camera off, so I'm guessing he's now in motion.

1406
02:11:31,083 --> 02:11:32,084
[SPEAKER_17]: potentially with others.

1407
02:11:32,104 --> 02:11:40,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if it's easier to talk now, Jesse, or if you prefer to wait until you get to a certain place later on in the process.

1408
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:43,973
[SPEAKER_17]: But feel free to just unmute and chime in if you do want to get going.

1409
02:11:45,033 --> 02:11:49,016
[SPEAKER_17]: If not, I will jump to the next individual on the list.

1410
02:11:49,036 --> 02:11:54,881
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1411
02:11:54,981 --> 02:11:56,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take it that you are still in transit.

1412
02:11:56,982 --> 02:11:59,144
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to pass it over to Marta.

1413
02:12:02,006 --> 02:12:06,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone, I feel so overwhelmed being with all of these architects on the call.

1414
02:12:07,351 --> 02:12:13,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I know when we talk educational lingo and all of our acronyms I now know how everyone feels.

1415
02:12:14,358 --> 02:12:17,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm thinking about my priority areas.

1416
02:12:18,562 --> 02:12:20,323
[SPEAKER_03]: For the exterior of the building.

1417
02:12:20,343 --> 02:12:32,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Libby for the longevity of it I don't want something trendy that is going to go out of style and 10 years and for 1520 years and people are like what were they thinking doing an all glass building.

1418
02:12:33,027 --> 02:12:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be yes modern.

1419
02:12:35,448 --> 02:12:38,570
[SPEAKER_03]: for our students, but also feeling warm and welcoming.

1420
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:48,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we are on like a beautiful plot of land here and not on a main road like many of our neighboring communities.

1421
02:12:48,514 --> 02:13:04,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to have sight lines out to the fells, sight lines out to like downtown Boston is really important because I think that that is something that is refreshing for students and for teachers to be able to see outside and see

1422
02:13:06,782 --> 02:13:08,542
[SPEAKER_03]: the beautiful files that we have in our backyard.

1423
02:13:10,443 --> 02:13:19,666
[SPEAKER_03]: For the interior, I also want something timeless that's not going to go, like I said, out of style and be trendy just for a couple of years.

1424
02:13:19,806 --> 02:13:23,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleanliness is super important for me.

1425
02:13:23,087 --> 02:13:25,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a pretty high standard of cleanliness.

1426
02:13:25,528 --> 02:13:30,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So for as long as I am here, whoever said that, this building will be maintained inside.

1427
02:13:31,609 --> 02:13:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, like,

1428
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:36,573
[SPEAKER_03]: um walls and spaces that can be cleaned.

1429
02:13:36,713 --> 02:13:52,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I am always hesitant with like carpet and so forth but like clean is very important and a place inside that like people can see themselves in and be able to um adapt with the populations that we have in the school is really important to me as well.

1430
02:13:53,526 --> 02:13:55,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Um what else did I write down?

1431
02:13:55,808 --> 02:13:56,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Sight lines.

1432
02:13:56,849 --> 02:14:02,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was fortunate enough to go to many different schools to visit schools and

1433
02:14:02,894 --> 02:14:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to create more flexible spaces for students to be and have more independence and responsibility and self-control of themselves in the building.

1434
02:14:13,885 --> 02:14:26,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, something that's really important is just being able to have sight lines so that they're not hiding and huddling in places that they're not allowed to be, but that staff and students can see each other.

1435
02:14:27,579 --> 02:14:29,220
[SPEAKER_03]: with the design inside the building.

1436
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And something that I've really seen in a lot of the school buildings that I've been is just bringing like Medford community or any of the communities that I've been to inside of the building.

1437
02:14:39,227 --> 02:14:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can we make it timeless with things that we have in the building that make it feel like Medford High School in a brand new space, I think is something really cool that we have seen a lot of.

1438
02:14:52,236 --> 02:15:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course our core values and our mascot that I think is so incredibly awesome of being like a Mustang like how can we incorporate that so like when we're having conversations with kids or we're having community events like they can actually see Medford and what we believe in.

1439
02:15:09,565 --> 02:15:10,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's it.

1440
02:15:10,726 --> 02:15:17,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Matt knows all about this, but like community spaces that hold all of us, like community is really big for us.

1441
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:19,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really trying to build that.

1442
02:15:19,631 --> 02:15:28,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So having spaces, not only for Medford community, but for our students and our staff to come together and making that feel like a warm place.

1443
02:15:30,478 --> 02:15:31,138
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all for me.

1444
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:32,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Off to you, Matt.

1445
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:34,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1446
02:15:35,986 --> 02:15:37,447
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a wonderful list.

1447
02:15:37,487 --> 02:15:37,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1448
02:15:37,907 --> 02:15:43,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured out how to unmute while in the car.

1449
02:15:43,209 --> 02:15:47,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just aimlessly pushing things on my screen.

1450
02:15:49,031 --> 02:15:49,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Is now a bad time?

1451
02:15:50,012 --> 02:15:51,672
[SPEAKER_17]: No, go right ahead.

1452
02:15:51,733 --> 02:15:52,613
[SPEAKER_17]: It's perfect, actually.

1453
02:15:53,233 --> 02:15:54,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Figures, strike while the iron's hot.

1454
02:15:57,035 --> 02:16:04,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I will unabashedly just say that I'm going to sort of advocate from the angle of

1455
02:16:06,267 --> 02:16:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: the visual and performing arts.

1456
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:20,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, where I am as a professional and where my students, you know, come into MassArt, I usually find out what their high school art experience was like.

1457
02:16:21,242 --> 02:16:27,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the parent of a often traveling orchestra participant,

1458
02:16:29,125 --> 02:16:35,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten to sort of drop into all these different spaces in high schools around the area.

1459
02:16:36,847 --> 02:16:52,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my priorities are as a community resource, as a sort of representation of the town of Medford, I'm hoping that there'll be some, that this sort of

1460
02:16:52,738 --> 02:17:13,994
[SPEAKER_04]: value of the arts in education will be readable in any new structure and not sort of tucked away into leftover spaces of a building, but really pushed forward as a highly valued part of the community.

1461
02:17:16,436 --> 02:17:21,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all I need to say before I hit traffic and start losing my concentration.

1462
02:17:23,475 --> 02:17:26,516
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I appreciate your ability to multitask there.

1463
02:17:27,237 --> 02:17:29,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Still very, very articulate, so I appreciate that.

1464
02:17:30,038 --> 02:17:30,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1465
02:17:30,418 --> 02:17:41,563
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so Griselle, I think you are next.

1466
02:17:42,468 --> 02:17:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the right.

1467
02:17:43,509 --> 02:17:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

1468
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:46,931
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get there.

1469
02:17:47,251 --> 02:17:50,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so impressed by Libby, how she pulled it off right on the spot.

1470
02:17:51,654 --> 02:17:52,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to take some notes.

1471
02:17:52,754 --> 02:17:56,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think everything that everybody said.

1472
02:17:57,577 --> 02:17:59,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, my dog is like, why?

1473
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:11,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, number one will be how to make the space safe and comfort and well-being for the students.

1474
02:18:12,823 --> 02:18:14,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, architecture.

1475
02:18:15,326 --> 02:18:18,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Can create that environment that feels physically and emotionally.

1476
02:18:18,810 --> 02:18:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Safe for the people that not only work there, but, you know.

1477
02:18:22,754 --> 02:18:26,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly for the students, um, how the classrooms can be flexible.

1478
02:18:26,618 --> 02:18:33,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, layouts you sitting and community, like Martha said, um.

1479
02:18:34,603 --> 02:18:40,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too familiar with what happens after school in the high school, because my kids are in elementary school.

1480
02:18:40,585 --> 02:18:43,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But how can this building be a community hub?

1481
02:18:47,788 --> 02:18:48,169
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

1482
02:18:49,529 --> 02:19:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talked about maintenance and all of that, which is one of the trendy things that I've seen a lot in other new schools is the unfinished wood, which looks beautiful the first couple of years.

1483
02:19:01,354 --> 02:19:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just doesn't weather well.

1484
02:19:04,992 --> 02:19:14,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, unless you guys have an amazing material, that maybe another material will be preferable.

1485
02:19:14,598 --> 02:19:19,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Sustainability, I think everybody kind of talked about that.

1486
02:19:19,141 --> 02:19:21,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is the connection to nature?

1487
02:19:22,883 --> 02:19:26,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, like Martha said, we're near the fells, right?

1488
02:19:27,566 --> 02:19:32,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I think whether it's LEED or the building, what's it called?

1489
02:19:33,009 --> 02:19:34,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Building's Living Challenge.

1490
02:19:35,638 --> 02:19:37,379
[SPEAKER_02]: which are great, you know, check marks.

1491
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:43,041
[SPEAKER_02]: What else can we do to connect students to nature, right?

1492
02:19:43,081 --> 02:19:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there a space where students can take a class outside, right?

1493
02:19:46,923 --> 02:19:49,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a great, amazing.

1494
02:19:50,684 --> 02:19:53,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Identity ride, the Mustangs, right?

1495
02:19:53,165 --> 02:20:01,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just having students maybe, I don't know, participate and creating a mural, anything that they will feel part of the space within.

1496
02:20:01,629 --> 02:20:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And accessibility.

1497
02:20:05,579 --> 02:20:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's not just a check mark of a ramp or an elevator, but how are we making this space inclusive?

1498
02:20:14,664 --> 02:20:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1499
02:20:16,385 --> 02:20:16,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1500
02:20:18,046 --> 02:20:18,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1501
02:20:21,447 --> 02:20:22,508
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Chloe.

1502
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:26,990
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi.

1503
02:20:27,331 --> 02:20:29,712
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to say,

1504
02:20:31,361 --> 02:20:32,762
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, we have to keep it simple.

1505
02:20:32,862 --> 02:20:40,445
[SPEAKER_37]: I kind of want to make sure it's inclusive, and it has a love culture, and it's uniquely us.

1506
02:20:40,846 --> 02:20:46,408
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a representation of everyone in the community, the staff, the students.

1507
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:58,314
[SPEAKER_37]: And I just want it to be a safe space for every student to be able to come in the school and just feel comfortable and relaxed and able to go on their day.

1508
02:21:01,655 --> 02:21:12,243
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I also agree with what a few of you guys said with not making it trendy, that it just looks weird in the next 20 years.

1509
02:21:15,245 --> 02:21:15,565
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry.

1510
02:21:16,746 --> 02:21:17,666
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I think that's it.

1511
02:21:20,228 --> 02:21:20,589
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1512
02:21:21,029 --> 02:21:24,171
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're getting a lot of head nods there from everyone that I could see.

1513
02:21:24,251 --> 02:21:26,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think definitely on point in terms of the comments.

1514
02:21:29,375 --> 02:21:29,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul.

1515
02:21:31,847 --> 02:21:44,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I think the everything I was going to talk about has been mentioned but they said to when deciding materials, if you're talking about 50 years, maybe flexible so things can be easily changed.

1516
02:21:45,595 --> 02:21:50,558
[SPEAKER_08]: If climate, and all that takes the impact on the school.

1517
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:57,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside the school, focus on the demographics of Medford.

1518
02:21:57,692 --> 02:22:05,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So that I think it's been mentioned too, but there's a great variety of people in Medford to take that into account.

1519
02:22:07,076 --> 02:22:10,198
[SPEAKER_08]: The entrances, I think, you know, make them welcoming.

1520
02:22:10,278 --> 02:22:13,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So when people come in, they can easily figure out where they're going.

1521
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's an after hours thing, if they're going to the theater or they're going to sports events or whatever, as you come into the school,

1522
02:22:21,075 --> 02:22:23,237
[SPEAKER_08]: it's easy to get where you're going.

1523
02:22:23,778 --> 02:22:25,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to go around asking people.

1524
02:22:27,762 --> 02:22:42,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in the public areas too, if we can try to incorporate Medford history, there's a lot of history from Medford going way back in those public areas when you're getting people from outside of Medford coming to events.

1525
02:22:43,779 --> 02:22:50,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of liked the idea of giving them information about where the city started and what's happened.

1526
02:22:50,963 --> 02:22:53,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's a lot of famous people to have come through Medford.

1527
02:22:57,166 --> 02:23:03,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a theater for doing, my daughter did a lot of orchestra and my son did a lot of band.

1528
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:07,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Karen Theater was nice, but it was kind of tight.

1529
02:23:08,452 --> 02:23:13,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'd be nice to have a nice theater where you can do the performances and those things.

1530
02:23:15,018 --> 02:23:19,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my son was in robotics when he was at the high school.

1531
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time they needed to set up a testing room, we had to go searching for rooms.

1532
02:23:25,903 --> 02:23:30,385
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't find one of them had like history of books and everything from history.

1533
02:23:30,405 --> 02:23:38,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be nice to have some dedicated rooms where after hours clubs can sign up or whatever and actually get the room.

1534
02:23:38,768 --> 02:23:43,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas we had to fight to get a space to set up a table for them to do the robotics stuff.

1535
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:53,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, flexibility in the rooms, you know, as times change and, you know, it used to be very separated where it's high school and it was vocational school.

1536
02:23:54,577 --> 02:23:55,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're kind of combined.

1537
02:23:56,218 --> 02:23:59,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So it may be a time where you get more of one than the other.

1538
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'd be nice to be a little flexible, have flexible rooms where you can adapt to that.

1539
02:24:04,964 --> 02:24:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause when I was at the high school, I had four brothers.

1540
02:24:08,065 --> 02:24:14,189
[SPEAKER_08]: And three of us graduated from the high school and two graduated from the vocational school way back when.

1541
02:24:15,049 --> 02:24:20,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'd be nice to be able to change things quickly.

1542
02:24:20,653 --> 02:24:24,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And my daughter, I went through the elementary school build out.

1543
02:24:25,696 --> 02:24:29,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So my daughter was at the Davenport school, which I went to, so it was old.

1544
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: As we went through that process of defining what the Roberts School in the Brooks, in the Mississippi, what they were going to incorporate into the colors and the floors to make it a lively place, make sure it's not dull and dark, which I'm sure we will anyway.

1545
02:24:52,166 --> 02:24:59,628
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we went through those designs for those schools, the four elementary schools and the two middle schools,

1546
02:25:00,724 --> 02:25:00,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It was...

1547
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:05,942
[SPEAKER_08]: important to incorporate that into the design.

1548
02:25:06,422 --> 02:25:16,848
[SPEAKER_08]: So my kids really liked, like we went to the, my daughter went to the Davenport school and when we went to kindergarten, when we left, my wife was crying because the school was so bad.

1549
02:25:16,868 --> 02:25:21,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, it was like, oh, I went there, this is cool, my daughter's gonna go there.

1550
02:25:22,250 --> 02:25:24,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But my wife was like, I can't believe we're sending her to this school.

1551
02:25:25,492 --> 02:25:28,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's good to upgrade to a better school.

1552
02:25:29,154 --> 02:25:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And my son was the first,

1553
02:25:31,692 --> 02:25:33,393
[SPEAKER_08]: kindergarten class to go through the Roberts.

1554
02:25:34,233 --> 02:25:37,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was the first class that went from kindergarten through fifth.

1555
02:25:38,055 --> 02:25:40,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got to see the full scope of the Roberts elementary school too.

1556
02:25:43,194 --> 02:25:44,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of had a lot of experience there.

1557
02:25:45,076 --> 02:25:51,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And my wife was a nurse at the Roberts, a school nurse back when my son was there.

1558
02:25:52,381 --> 02:26:05,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's more just make it inviting and kind of give a little bit of method history and method high for the public to see.

1559
02:26:06,452 --> 02:26:07,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.

1560
02:26:08,517 --> 02:26:08,757
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1561
02:26:09,198 --> 02:26:20,488
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of the things that you touched on, Paul, I think Sarah has definitely piqued her interest on the wayfinding as well as the... I'm typing as quick as my little fingers can go for everybody.

1562
02:26:21,049 --> 02:26:22,150
[SPEAKER_25]: This is really helpful.

1563
02:26:22,190 --> 02:26:22,570
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1564
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:27,115
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1565
02:26:28,696 --> 02:26:30,057
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were at Suzanne.

1566
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:32,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we're going to jump over to Jenny.

1567
02:26:35,838 --> 02:26:50,649
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks so, you know, 1 of the things that I've been thinking a lot about over the last couple of weeks as we sort of separate from these advisory groups have been involved in some all day visioning about what education should look like.

1568
02:26:50,749 --> 02:26:50,969
[SPEAKER_30]: Right?

1569
02:26:51,009 --> 02:26:52,991
[SPEAKER_30]: Because that's the anchor of this design.

1570
02:26:54,992 --> 02:27:02,218
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, 1 of the things that the students who have joined us for for those conversations and I think we're sort of hearing from Chloe is like.

1571
02:27:02,803 --> 02:27:07,587
[SPEAKER_30]: And from Marta is this idea of a sense of ownership.

1572
02:27:07,947 --> 02:27:11,009
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think I want to take that one step further.

1573
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:17,094
[SPEAKER_30]: I want us to build a building that expects that ownership is going to change hands.

1574
02:27:17,194 --> 02:27:19,936
[SPEAKER_30]: So students spend four years in the building.

1575
02:27:20,817 --> 02:27:31,826
[SPEAKER_30]: What resonates with Chloe today is not going to be the same thing as what resonates with Jesse's youngest when he's in school or when Libby's kids go to school.

1576
02:27:32,706 --> 02:27:44,664
[SPEAKER_30]: I think trying to create some really intentional ways that the building is intended to be owned by students, but in an evolving way that does not require

1577
02:27:46,259 --> 02:27:53,064
[SPEAKER_30]: big capital kinds of projects, like we have to hire people to repaint the hall.

1578
02:27:53,404 --> 02:27:59,970
[SPEAKER_30]: What are those ways that ownership can bring not just the common spaces, but classrooms to life?

1579
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:11,959
[SPEAKER_30]: In a conversation we were having last week, one of the things I was thinking a lot about is if a classroom has, let's say, five or six classes that go through it on any given year,

1580
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:35,034
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there, like, a corner of the classroom that's each class's responsibility to, like, own and maintain in some way that says, like, this is who our class is so that the people who come behind them in, like, period 4, like, they can see something come out that, like, helps them create some connection to, like, who the other kids are who are sharing the space and a sense of accountability.

1581
02:28:35,792 --> 02:28:39,615
[SPEAKER_30]: That's something I've been thinking a lot about is like, how do we build a building?

1582
02:28:39,715 --> 02:28:50,061
[SPEAKER_30]: And I actually don't know how to do this or if it's possible, but how do we build a building that insists upon evolution when students are moving through the space?

1583
02:28:51,222 --> 02:28:55,645
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll also mention that Jesse and I have had some spirited conversations about

1584
02:28:56,604 --> 02:29:03,566
[SPEAKER_30]: our Mustang logo and how we should all coalesce around a logo that maybe could be brought into the design.

1585
02:29:03,626 --> 02:29:08,467
[SPEAKER_30]: So maybe we can get that knocked out at some point ahead of all of this.

1586
02:29:09,607 --> 02:29:25,511
[SPEAKER_30]: And then when I think about the exterior of the building, every time I'm on that soccer field being blown over by the wind, I'm kind of struck by this untapped, incredible view of the skyline of the city of Boston.

1587
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:28,842
[SPEAKER_30]: that exists, and I'm like, how do we have an event on the roof?

1588
02:29:28,902 --> 02:29:32,303
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think Ken would die to hear me say that out loud.

1589
02:29:32,344 --> 02:29:47,032
[SPEAKER_30]: But there's these amazing spaces, and just think about the potential of some of these spaces if they could be created in such a way that they're intended to be used for those kinds of things.

1590
02:29:49,334 --> 02:29:56,713
[SPEAKER_30]: I have a Paul shared an article with me, like, 2 years ago about this, like, middle school that was designed.

1591
02:29:58,255 --> 02:30:06,242
[SPEAKER_30]: and how when kids get to high school, they want to have their senior prom at this middle school because there's a river, like a brook, that runs through.

1592
02:30:06,302 --> 02:30:08,444
[SPEAKER_30]: And they integrate it into the design.

1593
02:30:08,484 --> 02:30:09,745
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's this really cool space.

1594
02:30:10,226 --> 02:30:14,029
[SPEAKER_30]: And ironically, it's in Oklahoma in the community that my husband grew up in.

1595
02:30:14,049 --> 02:30:19,334
[SPEAKER_30]: And he was fascinated because he didn't think that was a thing where he was from.

1596
02:30:19,354 --> 02:30:22,476
[SPEAKER_30]: He's like, are you sure that's War Acres?

1597
02:30:22,556 --> 02:30:25,179
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I lived there, and nothing like that was happening.

1598
02:30:25,779 --> 02:30:26,559
[SPEAKER_30]: when I lived there.

1599
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:41,285
[SPEAKER_30]: But like, thinking about not just this space that like students own, but that they want to be in, even in those times where they're like, doing something where you would traditionally be like, I want to not be in this space, right?

1600
02:30:41,325 --> 02:30:43,786
[SPEAKER_30]: Like, how do we create a space that kids want to be in?

1601
02:30:43,806 --> 02:30:48,268
[SPEAKER_30]: It's something I'm thinking about, especially for the exterior.

1602
02:30:48,448 --> 02:30:49,529
[SPEAKER_30]: And when we talk about

1603
02:30:52,125 --> 02:30:56,069
[SPEAKER_30]: like, what is possible about playing fields and all of those things that happen outside.

1604
02:30:56,990 --> 02:31:02,035
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the other thing I would say is, like, the wayfinding is, like, pretty important.

1605
02:31:02,595 --> 02:31:04,597
[SPEAKER_30]: I get lost in the building all the time.

1606
02:31:04,617 --> 02:31:16,229
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the last thing I'll mention is that there's all these, like, cool artifacts, particularly in the bistro, that have been plucked out of different old buildings across the city of Medford.

1607
02:31:17,249 --> 02:31:27,953
[SPEAKER_30]: But you would never know the significance of any of those things unless you sat with somebody who has been around for, would call themselves a Medford dinosaur and has been around for a million years.

1608
02:31:28,754 --> 02:31:31,254
[SPEAKER_30]: And there's a light fixture.

1609
02:31:31,294 --> 02:31:33,155
[SPEAKER_30]: And they're like, that's from the original Burke School.

1610
02:31:33,175 --> 02:31:34,796
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm like, how cool.

1611
02:31:34,856 --> 02:31:45,480
[SPEAKER_30]: So how do we bring those elements in, but also put a sign so you don't have to know somebody who would call themselves a dinosaur to know that that light came from somewhere kind of cool, right?

1612
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:53,602
[SPEAKER_30]: There's just such an opportunity for the building, I think, to tell its own story that we should explore.

1613
02:31:53,622 --> 02:31:56,824
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that's it.

1614
02:31:57,044 --> 02:32:00,165
[SPEAKER_30]: That's all I've got, because I'm not actually an interior or exterior designer.

1615
02:32:02,906 --> 02:32:03,966
[SPEAKER_17]: No problems there.

1616
02:32:04,846 --> 02:32:05,386
[SPEAKER_17]: That was great.

1617
02:32:05,787 --> 02:32:06,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1618
02:32:06,847 --> 02:32:07,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Brian, I think you're up next.

1619
02:32:14,069 --> 02:32:14,469
[SPEAKER_20]: There we go.

1620
02:32:14,670 --> 02:32:14,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

1621
02:32:16,712 --> 02:32:23,618
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe, I guess I think I'm in a little bit of a unique situation and a little bit of background.

1622
02:32:24,578 --> 02:32:37,289
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of educators in my family and my dad is a high school teacher and I grew up, we went to actually a private school, but we had our own sort of CTE component.

1623
02:32:38,350 --> 02:32:40,972
[SPEAKER_20]: So I grew up around this kind of a school and

1624
02:32:42,730 --> 02:32:44,871
[SPEAKER_20]: Our son is in the robotics and engineering.

1625
02:32:44,911 --> 02:32:45,872
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, he's a junior.

1626
02:32:46,952 --> 02:32:50,954
[SPEAKER_20]: So I have really strong feelings about the CTE as well.

1627
02:32:52,194 --> 02:32:57,876
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm a huge advocate there, and I know how important it is to the community, to the kids, and to the teachers.

1628
02:32:59,017 --> 02:33:09,481
[SPEAKER_20]: If I parallel that and couple that with my experience in architecture and actually working on these big schools, public schools and high schools,

1629
02:33:10,793 --> 02:33:30,937
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I'm in a pretty unique position, like I said, to see myself as a liaison between what comes at us and filtering that and working with all the teachers and being on the school board, sorry, the school building committee actually allows me a lot of access to all the people.

1630
02:33:31,017 --> 02:33:33,297
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've been getting a lot of questions, a lot of feedback.

1631
02:33:34,037 --> 02:33:37,098
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I'm happy to be here.

1632
02:33:37,856 --> 02:33:59,719
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll go out on a limb and say that I'm actually really excited for what Sims at SFMA and left field bring to the table because I know their finger is on the pulse of what's out there as far as materials and the cost analysis and what's hip and not hip and going to be great in 50 years.

1633
02:34:01,643 --> 02:34:09,870
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we get to react to that, but I have a ton of confidence that they're going to come up with a really good product and really good things.

1634
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:22,180
[SPEAKER_20]: And what I'm really, really interested in is programming, like space planning and programming, making sure that everybody sees the end result as an end user.

1635
02:34:23,121 --> 02:34:29,407
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that the phasing is going to be really big, too, and that it's going to be important

1636
02:34:30,589 --> 02:34:39,954
[SPEAKER_20]: For me to help explain maybe what's going to some of the impacts between what's the ideas behind the phasing and what it actually means in reality.

1637
02:34:39,974 --> 02:34:50,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think there's great opportunities because obviously we know we have a great site, and we know in a very unique situation we have a ton of land, but it's a really complicated project.

1638
02:34:51,937 --> 02:34:53,318
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm excited.

1639
02:34:53,338 --> 02:34:54,019
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm excited.

1640
02:34:55,019 --> 02:34:59,503
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish I was back on the other end of the table, because these are the things that make a project like this great.

1641
02:35:01,544 --> 02:35:06,828
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've also spent, somebody already mentioned, we've had the student development meeting.

1642
02:35:07,709 --> 02:35:14,273
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really want to adhere to some of the things that were just put out there.

1643
02:35:14,454 --> 02:35:15,915
[SPEAKER_20]: These are our guiding principles.

1644
02:35:16,535 --> 02:35:17,576
[SPEAKER_20]: from the student's perspective.

1645
02:35:17,616 --> 02:35:21,479
[SPEAKER_20]: And tomorrow, you know, we have the teaching and learning meeting, that all day meeting as well.

1646
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:26,143
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'll be able to coalesce that and filter that through.

1647
02:35:26,163 --> 02:35:31,507
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's going to be really amazing to watch this come together.

1648
02:35:31,527 --> 02:35:38,833
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said, I know there's a lot of really good professionals behind this entire process.

1649
02:35:39,794 --> 02:35:42,296
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're going to benefit from it.

1650
02:35:42,837 --> 02:35:43,277
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think

1651
02:35:45,925 --> 02:36:03,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, being hyper aware of what's coming at us and then being able to help disseminate some of that information or get some behind the scenes questions from particularly the CTE people who are, you know, they're concerned because they have such specialty spaces, but also being on the building committee.

1652
02:36:03,949 --> 02:36:14,572
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm one of the people who really I'm not concerned because I know this is going to be a long process, but it's going to be a great result.

1653
02:36:16,452 --> 02:36:24,156
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, right now I'm, I don't have a ton to say, like, I just, I feel fortunate to be here.

1654
02:36:24,276 --> 02:36:29,178
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm super excited for the community, but the kids, they're coming up through the system.

1655
02:36:30,039 --> 02:36:43,345
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know, you know, again, the experts behind this and trying to sort of get the scheduling right for the new school so that the CTE and, you know, more of the academic wing mesh a little bit better.

1656
02:36:44,430 --> 02:37:06,242
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll end on the note that one of the things that came up already in the student development meeting was there's going to be sort of a paradigm shift for the way the kids learn, the way the teachers teach, moving forward so that when the building opens in 2030,

1657
02:37:08,365 --> 02:37:11,628
[SPEAKER_20]: that they walk into a space that they're ready for.

1658
02:37:12,108 --> 02:37:13,829
[SPEAKER_20]: And to me, that's really important.

1659
02:37:13,889 --> 02:37:21,495
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is, again, it's a very big picture, but it's going to be a learning curve right out of the box.

1660
02:37:22,476 --> 02:37:29,101
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's going to be a lot of changes, but everything doesn't change when we get to the new building.

1661
02:37:29,141 --> 02:37:31,823
[SPEAKER_20]: It changes now, and we're ready for it.

1662
02:37:32,043 --> 02:37:34,445
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's going to be an amazing process.

1663
02:37:34,465 --> 02:37:37,648
[SPEAKER_20]: So here we go.

1664
02:37:38,927 --> 02:37:39,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Brian.

1665
02:37:42,108 --> 02:37:45,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Is Din someone that was here or not here?

1666
02:37:45,329 --> 02:37:49,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in the not here category.

1667
02:37:49,991 --> 02:37:50,271
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1668
02:37:50,691 --> 02:37:51,572
[SPEAKER_17]: So Ken, that means you're up.

1669
02:37:52,172 --> 02:37:52,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

1670
02:37:53,032 --> 02:37:53,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1671
02:37:53,312 --> 02:38:00,135
[SPEAKER_19]: So over my career, I've been heavily involved in whole or in part in about seven school building projects.

1672
02:38:00,155 --> 02:38:04,496
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've seen a lot of decisions that are made in the process and the before and the after effects.

1673
02:38:05,257 --> 02:38:08,518
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of the things I'm really interested in is the durability of the materials.

1674
02:38:09,241 --> 02:38:21,146
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one project that I was involved in, it was a new elementary school built from scratch, but they used too much drywall and those surfaces became damaged too easily, and it just made the building look bad over time.

1675
02:38:21,707 --> 02:38:35,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Another project I was involved with was a renovation addition of a high school, and they used a lot of glazed block in the hallways, which was very durable, and they also did the same materials in the new sections and the renovations and the old sections, they redid it.

1676
02:38:36,002 --> 02:38:39,664
[SPEAKER_19]: So you really, unless you knew the building, you really couldn't tell the difference in the old and the new.

1677
02:38:40,144 --> 02:38:41,945
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's of particular interest to me.

1678
02:38:41,965 --> 02:39:02,114
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Jenny made a joke about the rooftop access, but I have toured buildings that did have purpose-built rooftop areas for classroom use, and it allowed those upper areas of the building easy access to like an outdoor learning area, whether it be tied to science or being able to view the fowls around us and everything else.

1679
02:39:02,154 --> 02:39:04,035
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is good opportunity for that.

1680
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,183
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not a no, that's what I'm hearing.

1681
02:39:07,603 --> 02:39:10,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Just no high heels on the rubber roof, that's all.

1682
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:22,499
[SPEAKER_19]: Maintenance is of particular importance to me, making sure the building materials that we use are easily maintained and the building itself is easily cleaned.

1683
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:25,502
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one school we had that had

1684
02:39:25,995 --> 02:39:34,819
[SPEAKER_19]: a hallway with a, um, it was a second floor hallway and you could see down to the first floor and beyond that was a window with big bars over it, but you couldn't reach it to clean it.

1685
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:39,561
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that was always that ugly spot in the building, even though it was meant to be a beautiful area.

1686
02:39:40,202 --> 02:39:45,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, our custodial staff is taxed with maintaining our grounds outside the building.

1687
02:39:45,204 --> 02:39:48,105
[SPEAKER_19]: So making sure that they're easily maintained.

1688
02:39:48,325 --> 02:39:49,386
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they're not, you know,

1689
02:39:49,830 --> 02:39:56,354
[SPEAKER_19]: that they don't get deteriorated quickly, um, that we're dealing with runoff water from the building on those exterior areas.

1690
02:39:56,394 --> 02:40:00,917
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not washing away the landscaping and things and dealt with properly.

1691
02:40:00,937 --> 02:40:06,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, although this is a high school, we have our kids corner program.

1692
02:40:06,741 --> 02:40:14,286
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, uh, and other programs, we need playground space and making sure those playground spaces are appropriately designed and have everything they need.

1693
02:40:16,055 --> 02:40:34,127
[SPEAKER_19]: The ease of cleaning of the building, making sure we don't have waxed floors, you know, that process of having to empty the room, strip the floors, wax the floors is so disruptive, plus the odors and the smells and there's all, you know, it takes up so much cleaning time in the summer, it really impacts how the building can be used.

1694
02:40:34,988 --> 02:40:40,492
[SPEAKER_19]: And making sure we have enough display space for student work and artwork.

1695
02:40:40,952 --> 02:40:42,493
[SPEAKER_19]: There's purpose-built spots.

1696
02:40:43,104 --> 02:40:45,105
[SPEAKER_19]: that we could have student murals done.

1697
02:40:45,145 --> 02:40:55,988
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not just kind of like attack on after the fact that, you know, nicely designed and plenty of space to hang things and ways to hang things that aren't going to damage the walls.

1698
02:40:56,068 --> 02:41:00,429
[SPEAKER_19]: So that, you know, you're not, you know, six months in and there's pinholes everywhere and stuff like that.

1699
02:41:00,469 --> 02:41:05,211
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are the kinds of things that I'm really interested in, in making sure that we kind of consider.

1700
02:41:05,251 --> 02:41:07,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1701
02:41:07,691 --> 02:41:09,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate that perspective, Ken.

1702
02:41:14,718 --> 02:41:20,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, I think Nicole was not here just confirming that still the case.

1703
02:41:22,042 --> 02:41:26,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. So I think we're gonna flip over to Jen.

1704
02:41:28,838 --> 02:41:30,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Or Jennifer, do you prefer Jennifer or Jen?

1705
02:41:30,459 --> 02:41:31,420
[SPEAKER_36]: No, Jen's fine.

1706
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:33,080
[SPEAKER_36]: I just don't change it.

1707
02:41:34,161 --> 02:41:36,763
[SPEAKER_36]: So these have all been really great.

1708
02:41:36,923 --> 02:41:43,867
[SPEAKER_36]: I have no architectural experience, but I have worked in this building for 18 years and I've had kids go through the building.

1709
02:41:43,907 --> 02:41:47,669
[SPEAKER_36]: So mine are gonna, everything people said, I agree with.

1710
02:41:47,789 --> 02:41:53,352
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm gonna focus kind of more like Marta on like how it feels like being in the building.

1711
02:41:53,452 --> 02:41:56,454
[SPEAKER_36]: And like, I don't know, I know we talked about

1712
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:15,537
[SPEAKER_36]: The building materials and I don't know how much of this, you guys have the ability to change but the flow driving into the building in the morning the traffic flow that one one entrance where the cars are crossing over and I've been here long enough that we've had the teacher parking is moved a little bit the student parking is moved a little bit.

1713
02:42:16,798 --> 02:42:28,810
[SPEAKER_36]: People try to drive around the building and then realize they can't for sporting events or I've been stuck behind a bus trying to like, I don't know, have to try to drive around and it's the corners aren't big enough to get buses around.

1714
02:42:29,691 --> 02:42:30,692
[SPEAKER_36]: So, all that.

1715
02:42:32,334 --> 02:42:34,757
[SPEAKER_36]: You can't circle around the building you know you get stuck at one end.

1716
02:42:36,157 --> 02:42:59,325
[SPEAKER_36]: As a parent, I cannot tell you how many people have gotten lost going to the gym because I don't think it's clear and like the entrance now that's been open for this year says pool entrance which is fine like I know where it is and it's but you walk in and like it's it's not clear you have to kind of go upstairs and you have to so better signage or like a welcoming front of the building or very clear like

1717
02:43:00,185 --> 02:43:13,802
[SPEAKER_36]: This is where you go for sporting events because it's it's I think our building is used all the time after school, sometimes during school weekends and I, it's people get lost there all the time.

1718
02:43:17,061 --> 02:43:35,741
[SPEAKER_36]: In terms of, I took notes as well, in terms of inside the building, everyone was talking about like representing our students in our school, we do such a good job right now we have so many like bright colorful murals that kids have painted in the building if we can have spaces like every year.

1719
02:43:36,602 --> 02:43:41,985
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, the National Art Honor Society does stuff like that, like maybe every year, every other year, the kids can paint it.

1720
02:43:42,045 --> 02:43:50,149
[SPEAKER_36]: You don't, but if you have a space designed for that or multiple spaces designed for that, then letting the kids paint on those spaces is acceptable.

1721
02:43:50,569 --> 02:43:53,391
[SPEAKER_36]: And so that would be really great to have it throughout the buildings.

1722
02:43:53,931 --> 02:43:59,354
[SPEAKER_36]: A couple of the buildings I've seen, I feel like they have a lot of very white spaces, the newer ones, and

1723
02:44:00,838 --> 02:44:05,642
[SPEAKER_36]: I agree with Marta we want to keep the building clean but sometimes maybe like the walls don't have to all be white too.

1724
02:44:06,463 --> 02:44:20,134
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think the kids have been really good at putting like colored stuff like there's just tons of murals in our building classrooms have them always have them and I would hate to not have the ability to do that and then like Jenny said like classrooms can.

1725
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:26,004
[SPEAKER_36]: have ways to, again, hang things up, have the kids do something in their classrooms.

1726
02:44:26,084 --> 02:44:39,916
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, paint is a pretty easy thing to change without having to, like... But also, like, my classroom has cinderblock walls on three of them, and then I don't even know what the back wall of the building is made out of.

1727
02:44:40,096 --> 02:44:42,098
[SPEAKER_36]: It, like, crumbles when you stick a tack in it.

1728
02:44:42,118 --> 02:44:45,941
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know if Ken knows what... I don't even know what material it is.

1729
02:44:46,081 --> 02:44:46,922
[SPEAKER_36]: It's... But...

1730
02:44:48,003 --> 02:44:50,706
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's really hard to hang stuff up, right?

1731
02:44:50,786 --> 02:44:57,292
[SPEAKER_36]: And then, so the only way to do it is do something like, you're doing glue, you're doing lots of things, and that's gonna peel the paint.

1732
02:44:57,912 --> 02:45:12,486
[SPEAKER_36]: And so having lots of materials that are friendly to hang stuff up, bulletin boards, I don't know how, I don't know what the best materials would be, but that kind of stuff on the walls, the more that we can do that, that way we can,

1733
02:45:13,828 --> 02:45:19,573
[SPEAKER_36]: alter the school to represent the kids that are in it without doing big money projects.

1734
02:45:20,193 --> 02:45:21,654
[SPEAKER_36]: Teachers are willing to decorate stuff.

1735
02:45:22,114 --> 02:45:23,135
[SPEAKER_36]: Kids are willing to help out.

1736
02:45:23,195 --> 02:45:26,298
[SPEAKER_36]: They like doing that kind of stuff.

1737
02:45:26,358 --> 02:45:28,019
[SPEAKER_36]: This year, they painted the parking lot.

1738
02:45:28,059 --> 02:45:37,606
[SPEAKER_36]: Things like that where it doesn't cost a lot of money, but if the building's set up for that already, then you can do that every year, every couple of years.

1739
02:45:38,267 --> 02:45:40,789
[SPEAKER_36]: So I thought that was really cool, some suggestions that people had.

1740
02:45:43,517 --> 02:45:48,481
[SPEAKER_36]: Right now, the academics and the CTE, the shops are- Jen, I apologize.

1741
02:45:48,561 --> 02:45:52,744
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the world's worst timekeeper, but I'm mindful that we're getting close to the end of the time.

1742
02:45:53,585 --> 02:45:55,366
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to make sure that we have the ability.

1743
02:45:55,386 --> 02:45:57,748
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have three more folks that haven't spoken yet.

1744
02:45:57,868 --> 02:46:02,971
[SPEAKER_17]: So I apologize in terms of having to jump in.

1745
02:46:03,972 --> 02:46:04,673
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you want me to finish?

1746
02:46:04,733 --> 02:46:05,453
[SPEAKER_36]: I have two more things.

1747
02:46:06,414 --> 02:46:06,934
[SPEAKER_36]: Or you want me to go?

1748
02:46:07,355 --> 02:46:07,715
[SPEAKER_36]: That's fine.

1749
02:46:08,133 --> 02:46:12,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we hold them, maybe, and if we have time at the end, I'm certainly welcome to circle back.

1750
02:46:12,795 --> 02:46:14,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Or we're certainly welcome to circle back.

1751
02:46:14,175 --> 02:46:14,235
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1752
02:46:14,315 --> 02:46:17,096
[SPEAKER_30]: You can drop them in the chat, too.

1753
02:46:17,497 --> 02:46:17,817
[SPEAKER_17]: We can drop them.

1754
02:46:17,837 --> 02:46:18,137
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, I'll do it.

1755
02:46:18,157 --> 02:46:18,517
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks, Jane.

1756
02:46:18,937 --> 02:46:19,737
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be fantastic.

1757
02:46:19,817 --> 02:46:20,578
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great option.

1758
02:46:21,798 --> 02:46:22,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul.

1759
02:46:23,179 --> 02:46:23,519
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello.

1760
02:46:24,879 --> 02:46:27,860
[SPEAKER_35]: So I won't repeat everything that's wonderful that I've heard tonight.

1761
02:46:28,121 --> 02:46:36,664
[SPEAKER_35]: I will say that I looked at the Architectural Digest has this edition of the most beautiful high school in each of the 50 states.

1762
02:46:38,214 --> 02:46:46,362
[SPEAKER_35]: And I thought, maybe three of them were remotely beautiful and the rest were that you could have didn't they meant they were nothing.

1763
02:46:47,043 --> 02:46:50,987
[SPEAKER_35]: They were just giant structures and somebody like this is the nicest one in our state.

1764
02:46:51,007 --> 02:46:55,011
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Mississippi had like this incredible one but anyways.

1765
02:46:57,634 --> 02:47:05,522
[SPEAKER_35]: And, you know, I've been driving by schools under construction, you know, Watertown, since they started it.

1766
02:47:06,102 --> 02:47:13,710
[SPEAKER_35]: And in Newton, there's a school I was driving by for years that they were building, a massive elementary school.

1767
02:47:16,443 --> 02:47:21,506
[SPEAKER_35]: The Newton one actually is beautiful and impressive and memorable.

1768
02:47:22,286 --> 02:47:35,934
[SPEAKER_35]: The Watertown one, I mean, they had the worst site on earth, so I'm not judging anybody here, but it is effectively the same as what you'd think of when you think of high school.

1769
02:47:38,452 --> 02:47:43,115
[SPEAKER_35]: When we are in high school, or we have kids that are in high school, we care about the high school.

1770
02:47:43,215 --> 02:47:45,717
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm not saying that after that we don't care.

1771
02:47:45,737 --> 02:47:52,421
[SPEAKER_35]: I will say it's far, it becomes in the rear view mirror until you perhaps have grandkids there.

1772
02:47:54,123 --> 02:47:59,326
[SPEAKER_35]: And so the majority of voters do not have kids in our schools.

1773
02:47:59,906 --> 02:48:04,910
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that them having pride, like a visceral pride,

1774
02:48:06,214 --> 02:48:12,999
[SPEAKER_35]: is a very valuable asset because with Prop 2.5, no, we're not going to do an override next year.

1775
02:48:13,519 --> 02:48:21,024
[SPEAKER_35]: But there's no universe, really, where we don't end up having to do more of them unless we can do an assembly row in Medford.

1776
02:48:22,825 --> 02:48:35,114
[SPEAKER_35]: And it would be nice if the voters had so much pride in this high school, whether it's they drive up because they have to see the superintendent, or we have a school committee meeting there, or they have kids there, whatever.

1777
02:48:36,543 --> 02:48:46,173
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, you know, right now, I know people who have driven up to the high school and been like, for kindergarten registration and been like, oh, well, I guess we'll go through eighth grade.

1778
02:48:46,193 --> 02:48:50,857
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, they would not go and they don't know how great the teaching is going on in there.

1779
02:48:51,558 --> 02:48:53,059
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, they don't know what's inside.

1780
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:59,185
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I think that is a mistake to not think of that as a critical, um,

1781
02:49:00,346 --> 02:49:06,630
[SPEAKER_35]: tool when we want to ask for more money because we're never going to get the school budget down to two and a half percent.

1782
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:08,051
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not going to happen.

1783
02:49:10,832 --> 02:49:20,178
[SPEAKER_35]: So if we're going to keep asking the voters, which is not just the parents, I think we need to make sure this building knocks their socks off.

1784
02:49:21,119 --> 02:49:26,502
[SPEAKER_35]: Whether it's because they're coming to a public meeting because there's finally more, Medford has so little public meeting space.

1785
02:49:27,123 --> 02:49:28,304
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a real problem.

1786
02:49:28,344 --> 02:49:32,206
[SPEAKER_35]: The library was like a godsend, but that's not enough.

1787
02:49:33,127 --> 02:49:39,691
[SPEAKER_35]: So, you know, we, I mean, aside from the pool and all that, we have a lot of opportunity to make this building

1788
02:49:41,007 --> 02:49:41,647
[SPEAKER_35]: inviting.

1789
02:49:41,727 --> 02:49:51,650
[SPEAKER_35]: I think some people talked about, you know, I agree, like the giant white spaces that you're kind of like, oh, you get lost because everything looks the same.

1790
02:49:51,750 --> 02:49:52,910
[SPEAKER_35]: That's all very important.

1791
02:49:53,030 --> 02:50:02,513
[SPEAKER_35]: But I do think because of our site, we have an opportunity that many other cities and towns just don't have any

1792
02:50:03,552 --> 02:50:08,897
[SPEAKER_35]: any chance at having a building that wows the community.

1793
02:50:09,658 --> 02:50:23,411
[SPEAKER_35]: And I know that's just the face of it, but I would like our students and our staff who are there for a lot more than four years to like regularly drive up and be like, I can't believe I get to work here or I can't believe I get to go to school here.

1794
02:50:24,072 --> 02:50:24,172
[SPEAKER_35]: And

1795
02:50:25,146 --> 02:50:28,768
[SPEAKER_35]: What's going on inside the building is obviously the most important thing.

1796
02:50:29,668 --> 02:50:33,490
[SPEAKER_35]: But when you're rushing through the halls to get to your class, that's not something you'll ever think of.

1797
02:50:33,570 --> 02:50:34,891
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not a feeling you will have.

1798
02:50:35,451 --> 02:50:38,513
[SPEAKER_35]: And it is something that you can have when you're driving up to the school.

1799
02:50:39,233 --> 02:50:40,373
[SPEAKER_35]: So my time's up.

1800
02:50:40,614 --> 02:50:40,854
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry.

1801
02:50:41,854 --> 02:50:42,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paul.

1802
02:50:43,535 --> 02:50:44,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate that.

1803
02:50:46,116 --> 02:50:46,857
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1804
02:50:46,957 --> 02:50:50,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's Delia next, and then Eric.

1805
02:50:50,598 --> 02:50:51,679
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys will close us out.

1806
02:50:52,500 --> 02:51:04,807
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I just wanted to echo a lot of what you all have said and reinforce it, especially regarding the health and environmental concerns that you've raised.

1807
02:51:06,568 --> 02:51:20,495
[SPEAKER_28]: Just to kind of piggyback a little bit on Paul's kind of more community-facing comments, I might just couch some of the things I'll say by the fact that most of my professional work deals with

1808
02:51:21,300 --> 02:51:26,544
[SPEAKER_28]: design and planning in the context of conflict or after a disaster.

1809
02:51:27,104 --> 02:51:40,293
[SPEAKER_28]: And so what that has taught me has been that civic spaces, public spaces are real cultural assets that we turn to, particularly in times of crisis.

1810
02:51:41,534 --> 02:51:44,856
[SPEAKER_28]: They are symbolic of cultural heritage.

1811
02:51:45,016 --> 02:51:47,297
[SPEAKER_28]: They are beacons of hope.

1812
02:51:47,538 --> 02:51:49,399
[SPEAKER_28]: They are places for gathering.

1813
02:51:50,693 --> 02:51:58,137
[SPEAKER_28]: They are critical indicators of, you know, the state of our democracy, et cetera, et cetera, right?

1814
02:51:58,177 --> 02:52:10,663
[SPEAKER_28]: So that there are some really real social values that are attached to places like schools and in terms of the ways in which they sit in our communities.

1815
02:52:12,004 --> 02:52:16,767
[SPEAKER_28]: And so, you know, practically speaking, not that we have to design for catastrophe,

1816
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:28,135
[SPEAKER_28]: Practically speaking, what that may translate into is what I'd love to see is a school that's rooted, a school that's rooted in the history and memory of a place.

1817
02:52:29,561 --> 02:52:39,846
[SPEAKER_28]: and a wholesome history, one that is inclusive in its reach and its representation, that makes space for that.

1818
02:52:40,346 --> 02:52:49,470
[SPEAKER_28]: A school that is designed in part with some thought to scenarios or storytelling.

1819
02:52:49,490 --> 02:52:52,752
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, what is it like at drop-off?

1820
02:52:53,570 --> 02:52:56,493
[SPEAKER_28]: What is that first introduction on a daily basis to the school?

1821
02:52:57,094 --> 02:52:59,976
[SPEAKER_28]: What is it as a space of community gathering?

1822
02:52:59,996 --> 02:53:10,686
[SPEAKER_28]: How is it a space that invites in nature, that looks to nature, given that the fells is a neighbor?

1823
02:53:10,706 --> 02:53:17,152
[SPEAKER_28]: How is it a school of experimentation, of performance?

1824
02:53:17,192 --> 02:53:18,514
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I think these are some of the points

1825
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:23,133
[SPEAKER_28]: My fellow committee members have already raised, so just to echo.

1826
02:53:23,153 --> 02:53:30,159
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I guess I would reinforce the importance of context.

1827
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:42,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Love to see a school that's really rooted in its historical context, in its community context, that really makes gestures both inwardly and outwardly.

1828
02:53:47,444 --> 02:54:00,536
[SPEAKER_28]: And then also thinks a lot about creative spaces, quiet spaces, kind of all of these kind of more affective qualities that we would like to see and imagine our kids and our staff.

1829
02:54:02,553 --> 02:54:03,874
[SPEAKER_28]: really taking advantage of.

1830
02:54:04,194 --> 02:54:21,521
[SPEAKER_28]: And just to end to say, and to reinforce the importance of this school in this community, both at this kind of hinge point, it's a place for our students to attend, a place where our teachers teach our kids in the present.

1831
02:54:22,381 --> 02:54:27,864
[SPEAKER_28]: but it's rooted in this community's history, and it's also gesturing towards the future.

1832
02:54:27,904 --> 02:54:39,970
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know these all need to be interpreted and materialized, I know, but just to kind of anchor us in some kind of a design philosophy of sorts.

1833
02:54:41,731 --> 02:54:45,053
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that'd be something that I'd love to talk more about.

1834
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:54,682
[SPEAKER_17]: If you appreciate all those aspirations, I think that's exactly what we're trying to do here is sort of set the stage for how we're going to be working moving forward.

1835
02:54:56,162 --> 02:54:57,502
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Eric, you are up.

1836
02:54:57,942 --> 02:55:00,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Next time we'll go reverse apple bell galore, so you're going to be first.

1837
02:55:00,723 --> 02:55:02,584
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll just throw everything on the side.

1838
02:55:02,604 --> 02:55:02,964
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fine.

1839
02:55:02,984 --> 02:55:03,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.

1840
02:55:03,544 --> 02:55:03,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.

1841
02:55:04,244 --> 02:55:10,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think one of the things that's really important to me is just how we see this school, but all schools in Medford, as an asset.

1842
02:55:10,665 --> 02:55:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people move to different places because the schools are good.

1843
02:55:13,666 --> 02:55:14,666
[SPEAKER_10]: They live in communities.

1844
02:55:14,746 --> 02:55:17,007
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to go places because the schools are

1845
02:55:17,847 --> 02:55:23,333
[SPEAKER_10]: great places for their kids to be, whether it's safety and security or the education they're receiving.

1846
02:55:23,353 --> 02:55:30,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just making sure that we think about how 20 years ago, we never could have expected we'd be living in the world we're living in.

1847
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:33,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no way we can predict what will happen in 20 years.

1848
02:55:33,423 --> 02:55:40,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So creating flexible, adaptive spaces so that the trained educators we have can make the best choices for our children.

1849
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:50,677
[SPEAKER_10]: can provide a good civic environment for our community, can allow for spaces that are used around the clock, maybe not 24-7, but certainly more than they are now.

1850
02:55:50,777 --> 02:55:51,998
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a place where people want to go.

1851
02:55:52,018 --> 02:56:04,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the library is a great example of an updated community resource where people are now going there for all kinds of maker spaces, and language lessons, and puzzle nights, and everything you can imagine under the sun.

1852
02:56:04,226 --> 02:56:08,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would hope that our schools do the same thing.

1853
02:56:10,088 --> 02:56:19,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Also keeping in mind that as technology changes, as pedagogies change, as learning environments change, we're really going to see something different than we all experienced.

1854
02:56:19,951 --> 02:56:27,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So while I want to cling to the things that were great for me, I know that my kids and their kids will get something that we haven't even considered.

1855
02:56:27,492 --> 02:56:34,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So putting the school in a place that it can adapt and change to be what we need it to be 30 years down the road, too.

1856
02:56:37,775 --> 02:56:38,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1857
02:56:39,404 --> 02:56:48,907
[SPEAKER_17]: That was great and I really appreciate the variety of perspectives and the expertise and the energy shared here as well.

1858
02:56:49,827 --> 02:56:56,170
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to try and pull up the PowerPoint just to close us out here.

1859
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:59,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully, this is up for everybody now.

1860
02:56:59,611 --> 02:57:05,773
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to just remind us on terms of next steps.

1861
02:57:06,876 --> 02:57:18,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we're going to take all of these topics and we're going to try to find overlaps, synergies between them so that we can talk to them and review them with you the next time around.

1862
02:57:19,301 --> 02:57:23,142
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get into a little discussion on some that really warrant a need.

1863
02:57:24,442 --> 02:57:28,243
[SPEAKER_17]: some additional sort of thought in sort of airspace behind them.

1864
02:57:29,503 --> 02:57:44,966
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're also going to have subsequent meetings to really confirm sort of that discussion and start to formulate recommendations and then get to a point where we can review those and then present them back to the full building committee as a recommendation.

1865
02:57:46,766 --> 02:57:49,607
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just to give a little bit of a preview here,

1866
02:57:51,770 --> 02:57:54,831
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we touched on a lot of these topics.

1867
02:57:54,851 --> 02:57:58,231
[SPEAKER_17]: We may have covered all of them in terms of the various things that have popped up.

1868
02:57:59,471 --> 02:58:12,353
[SPEAKER_17]: But we want to make sure that the next discussion that we have both reflects what was brought up and then sort of fills in any gaps as well in terms of things that just need to be touched on.

1869
02:58:12,413 --> 02:58:17,274
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I think I heard topics that really touched on all of these.

1870
02:58:17,294 --> 02:58:20,795
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think this is just sort of for reference and for reflecting back.

1871
02:58:22,225 --> 02:58:26,881
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just a reminder that again, we're middle of January is the next time we're going to get together.

1872
02:58:27,816 --> 02:58:31,379
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we flipped up the timing so that this group is actually going to be from 4-5.30.

1873
02:58:31,499 --> 02:58:34,702
[SPEAKER_17]: I did put in remote hybrid there.

1874
02:58:34,722 --> 02:58:44,330
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the wonderful thing about this all remote virtual setup is that it really facilitates people participating everywhere that you are.

1875
02:58:44,810 --> 02:58:47,452
[SPEAKER_17]: You can log in and there's something great about that.

1876
02:58:48,093 --> 02:58:52,757
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also something great about being able to be in person and have some of these conversations face-to-face.

1877
02:58:53,857 --> 02:59:12,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we won't try to preclude it necessarily moving forward but if we may shift to a hybrid approach where we give people that opportunity if they want to get together and facilitate that and I know that we're just increasing the degree of difficulty for Ken and folks in terms of the organization of it, but I know that we do to the building committee meetings.

1878
02:59:13,210 --> 02:59:16,975
[SPEAKER_17]: as a hybrid format so we can get that to work if we move forward.

1879
02:59:17,877 --> 02:59:22,083
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's really what to look forward to and again really appreciate everyone getting together.

1880
02:59:22,103 --> 02:59:27,030
[SPEAKER_17]: A special thanks to the folks that have done this twice now and I know there's sort of a Groundhog Day aspect

1881
02:59:28,051 --> 02:59:33,594
[SPEAKER_17]: to this activity sometimes when we're sitting in multiple versions of the meeting of the different advisory team meetings.

1882
02:59:33,674 --> 02:59:43,119
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the thing that comes through in all of these and came through today is sort of the unique energy and perspective that comes from this particular group.

1883
02:59:43,960 --> 02:59:53,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And really do look forward to working with everyone moving forward just to advance the conversation and really to help crystallize some of these thoughts about how they guide the design for the high school.
