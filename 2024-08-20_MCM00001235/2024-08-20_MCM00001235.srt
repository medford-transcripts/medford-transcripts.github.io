1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:11,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the public meeting, the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for March 20th, 24th will come to order.

2
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:14,950
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have an agenda to follow.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:26,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing on the agenda is to approve the minutes of last month's meeting, plus we have

4
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:32,909
[SPEAKER_01]: some additional minutes that were sent to us by Gary to approve as well.

5
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:37,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

6
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:38,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.

7
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:40,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we start with last month's minutes.

9
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:49,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a chance to review them.

10
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,343
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked perfectly fine to me.

11
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, I don't know if you had a chance to check it out.

12
00:00:56,983 --> 00:01:01,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, Commissioner, I did have a chance to check them out.

13
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:18,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the minutes from January 11th and then the other minutes from February 21st and they were really detailed and those were, you know, fairly extensive meetings and from everything I can remember, they look accurate and they look good.

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks Darya.

15
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:23,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.

16
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:29,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of work, especially we did cover a lot of stuff.

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:41,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do is approve the minutes for the February 21st meeting.

20
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:44,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, if you want to make a motion for the minutes.

21
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I approve them both?

22
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:48,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

23
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:48,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a motion for both?

24
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:49,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

25
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm going to make a motion to approve the minutes for the two meetings we've had so far this year.

26
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:02,156
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is for the January 11, 2024 minutes.

27
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:10,181
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one is for the February 21, 2024 minutes for the License Commission meeting.

28
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,383
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I second the motion.

29
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:15,764
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

30
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:17,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

31
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:26,240
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion to accept the minutes is an order and those are all squared away.

32
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:37,063
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like to do, Ben, if it's okay with you is just go a little out of order.

33
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's fine.

34
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:44,845
[SPEAKER_01]: On the agenda because we have a couple that are going to involve a little bit of time and we don't want to tie too many people up.

35
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:56,801
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we also have to do is, well, what I'd like to start with is new business first.

36
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:14,075
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason being is that we seem to be having an issue lately with people coming to this commission for not only one-day licenses, but other items as well.

37
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:24,901
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're coming in after the 48-hour round agenda.

38
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:35,705
[SPEAKER_01]: The agenda's got to be posted 48 hours by law before the meeting, and we are not allowed to vote on anything unless it's on the agenda.

39
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,066
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're receiving

40
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:49,689
[SPEAKER_01]: applications for one day licenses or anything else that's coming in the day of or a day before, it's not good.

41
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:55,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And we shouldn't be voting on it unless it's on the agenda.

42
00:03:55,647 --> 00:04:08,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was going to say is maybe we can have Daria put on next month's agenda that we can make a motion to strictly enforce the 48-hour rule.

43
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:20,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe set even a deadline, you know, for the Friday prior, because sometimes you have a Monday holiday and she can't get legally.

44
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,435
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't we don't have enough time for the 48 hour rule.

45
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:47,183
[SPEAKER_01]: uh the open meeting law rule so i i would suggest that maybe just put it on the agenda that we can talk about it next month when the chairman's here as well and um and from that point forward um we can enforce it i know we had a couple today um and and you know i don't think we i don't have a problem with putting them through but

46
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:52,924
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult, especially we've got a couple of fairly large things today.

47
00:04:52,944 --> 00:05:01,227
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while to read through a lot of this paperwork, so we can't get it an hour or two before it's not going to happen.

48
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:05,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus Daria, God bless her, she's wonderful.

49
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:12,450
[SPEAKER_01]: She's doing a regular job at City Hall as well as handling this stuff for us and keeping everything in order.

50
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,550
[SPEAKER_01]: She's what makes everything work.

51
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even doing a,

52
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine a strain on down here as well.

53
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, that's enough for that.

54
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the new business that I had.

55
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:27,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any new business?

56
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I agree.

57
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:39,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanna process a lot of business in here and we just need them in on time so that we can get them on the agenda and just get it done right and help everybody out the best we can.

58
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So no, I'm totally in favor of that.

59
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So say we add that to next month and we'll move on.

60
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:46,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sounds great.

61
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,683
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, let's see.

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Next item on the agenda.

63
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:04,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to go to, we have Leilani from the Medford Public Library.

64
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:07,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

65
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:09,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you?

66
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:10,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say your name right, Leilani?

67
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, perfect, thank you.

68
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

69
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little bit about what's going on?

70
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're looking for a one-day license at the library.

71
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:22,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

72
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:24,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the same event we did last year.

73
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our trivia night.

74
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,094
[SPEAKER_08]: We're expecting about 100 people.

75
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:30,695
[SPEAKER_08]: They will all be pre-sold tickets.

76
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:42,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fundraiser, Saturday, May 4th in the evening, and just beer and wine and volunteers that are pouring beer and wine.

77
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Just snacks, nothing substantial food wise.

78
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

79
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:52,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know you folks always do a really good job.

80
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You've sent us layouts of the.

81
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,590
[SPEAKER_01]: of the functions and stuff.

82
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.

83
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:07,456
[SPEAKER_01]: You also, I believe we have on file your insurance for that as well.

84
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, yeah.

85
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have an issue with any of it.

86
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, how about yourself?

87
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,369
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I concur.

88
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have never had any problems, and we're happy that you're having good events at the library, great space.

89
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm good with it.

90
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I can make a motion to move this one along.

91
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:33,607
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.

92
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:37,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I will second the motion.

93
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:39,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'll just say it.

94
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:52,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to accept the one day license that's for the Friends of Medford Library for the one day on May the 4th.

95
00:07:55,681 --> 00:08:00,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the insurance on file, we have layouts on file, so I'll make a motion to accept that.

96
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:03,284
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll second that motion.

97
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:04,165
[SPEAKER_01]: All in favor?

98
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:05,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

99
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:06,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

100
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:08,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion accepted.

101
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:11,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

102
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:12,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good day.

103
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,350
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, thank you.

104
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:14,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

105
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

106
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:15,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

107
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:16,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

108
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, next thing on the agenda.

109
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:23,740
[SPEAKER_01]: We had just a quick

110
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:32,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need a favorable approval of the Ocean State job lot.

111
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The DUA certificate.

112
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:35,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Ocean State here?

113
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:36,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

114
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:37,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

115
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon, members of the Commission.

116
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Ross.

117
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an attorney for Ocean State.

118
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:42,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike.

119
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:43,152
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

120
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:43,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

121
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.

122
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:46,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my pleasure.

123
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:51,237
[SPEAKER_01]: We did receive the DUA certificate.

124
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks in order.

125
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Daria, you are satisfied with that as well?

126
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all good already.

127
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:18,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have an issue with, I know we have had to revisit it and you folks, you know, we were able to get the information that we needed and it should be good to go unless Ben, you have anything, anything to say on it?

128
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we discussed it and I'm in agreement.

129
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're fine.

130
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good to go there.

131
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:29,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, if you want to make a motion to accept the.

132
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:34,490
[SPEAKER_01]: The certificate from motion state job lot, we should be good to go.

133
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so let me just word this correctly.

134
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:38,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

135
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, where are they.

136
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:48,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So, sorry.

137
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I just make one suggestion here?

138
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,368
[SPEAKER_04]: This may help out.

139
00:09:52,408 --> 00:10:05,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need, and you can certainly correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we need a motion if the commission is willing to approve the applicant, the change in manager application, the DOA certificate was just that we didn't have it the last time.

140
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, so I don't know that it was ever approved.

141
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,557
[SPEAKER_07]: It was approved.

142
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:13,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It was approved last year.

143
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:14,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.

144
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:17,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the commission rejected it because of the DUA certification?

145
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the commission approved it, but it was the ABCC that rejected it.

146
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

147
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:23,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

148
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:29,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And they worked with Nicole, but they never got anything in a timely manner.

149
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why they said that this would be a consideration from them to get the, once they get the updated DUA certificate.

150
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:38,382

[SPEAKER_01]: So, once once we approve that area, you send it back to the and it gets approved through them.

153
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:46,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, there's a lot of paperwork on this one.

165
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:40,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.

00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I will second that motion.

00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:07,902
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

179
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

180
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,083
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

181
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:10,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

182
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:10,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

183
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:13,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just pull this up.

184
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:17,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

185
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about your event, Gina?

186
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an event we have had for many years.

187
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:28,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a $300 raffle, elimination raffle.

188
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we want to serve beer and wine.

189
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have some snacks.

190
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: We're expecting about 200 people.

191
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on April 5th.

192
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is people buy $100 ticket, and then the last couple standing either split the raffle or the last number drawn wins the $10,000.

193
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a $10,000 prize.

194
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:53,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, very nice.

195
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:54,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.

196
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:55,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.

197
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:58,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you might have come way, way back in your day.

198
00:12:59,059 --> 00:12:59,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, exactly.

199
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:00,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing it then too.

200
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun too, which is great.

201
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:06,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you folks have been doing this for a while.

202
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We never have any problems with St.

203
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray's.

204
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,540
[SPEAKER_01]: You always do as we ask.

205
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:23,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I even see that you submitted your insurance certificate and a sketch of the layout of the event, which is great.

206
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't see any issues with that.

207
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,227
[SPEAKER_01]: How about yourself, Ben?

208
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

209
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll get a licensed bartender to serve?

210
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:36,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a tip serve bartender.

211
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:38,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

212
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:41,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

213
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:53,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it someone you bring in or is just somebody that's part of the congregation or part of the... It's someone that works, someone at the school works, their relative comes in.

214
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

215
00:13:54,436 --> 00:13:58,799
[SPEAKER_02]: They work in a restaurant though, they do catering and stuff, so... I vaguely remember this.

216
00:13:58,819 --> 00:13:59,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it somebody's daughter?

217
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

218
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Juliana.

219
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

220
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember asking this last time.

221
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's fine.

222
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:14,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used to use parent volunteers, which didn't work out so well.

223
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had this lady for.

224
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

225
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:28,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just because, you know, can be that's a pretty good crowd and and outside of church is not we're not worried about it, but it's just a good crowd of people.

226
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So good to have somebody very confident doing it.

227
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

228
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:40,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing the layout, I'm seeing the insurance, and I'm not worried about anything.

229
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any questions.

230
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with this one, Bob, if you want me to make a motion.

231
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:48,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, go right ahead.

232
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:49,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

233
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:59,930
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so I will make a motion to accept the one-day alcohol license for May, no, April 5th.

234
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,890
[SPEAKER_05]: April 5th.

235
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:04,968
[SPEAKER_06]: April 5th, right, for St.

236
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Raphael's Parish.

00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:13,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from the event from 6.30 to 11.30 p.m.

238
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:18,478
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for the parish and parent social fundraiser.

239
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:24,643
[SPEAKER_06]: We're accepting the insurance and the layout that has been provided by Gene.

240
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I second.

241
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:31,602
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion?

242
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,344
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

243
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:35,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

244
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:37,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeanne, you're up.

245
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one question.

246
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,830
[SPEAKER_02]: In previous years, I didn't see one last year.

247
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I get a paper copy of the license?

248
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:47,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you stop doing that?

249
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get one from a little certificate.

250
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeanne, if you need it, I can provide it to you, but it's up to you.

251
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:07,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you don't need it, I just wanted to make sure that if someone comes in, I used to post it like I would put it in a little frame by the bar, just to say we're legit.

252
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,917
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as it's okay with you guys, I don't have that up there.

253
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:10,517
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

254
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:11,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever.

255
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:12,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, nobody has that issue.

256
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't okay, unless they asked me for it.

257
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't give it because we know it's approved.

258
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:18,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

259
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:19,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

260
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:20,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

261
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:21,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So now minutes.

262
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

263
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's a good one.

264
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

265
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, moving right along.

266
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Representative from Boston Glory, are you here?

267
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,935
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me.

268
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:43,375
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

269
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is your name, sir?

270
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay Tallerman.

271
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,642
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the owners of Boston Glory.

272
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,804
[SPEAKER_00]: This is year four for us.

273
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're back.

274
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,351
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back.

275
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, made the playoffs last year.

276
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,298
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back.

277
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:01,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good year.

278
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,045
[SPEAKER_00]: No incidents again.

279
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:06,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be back.

280
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

281
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,922
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

282
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:11,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

283
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically just the series of events.

284
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:20,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, I have the 6 states here and the times.

285
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:26,926
[SPEAKER_01]: The only question I had what I really like is.

286
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: the layout you sent to us that you keep the alcohol in one section.

287
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:40,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you guys were the first ones that did it last year.

288
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,935
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when I saw it is that you rope off a portion of the stands.

289
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:49,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So now people want to sit and have a refreshment while they're watching the game.

290
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:53,159
[SPEAKER_01]: They're contained just to that area, which is- Right.

291
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,980
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really thankful that

292
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:16,200
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, between Kevin Bailey and the Hormel Commission and you all, we were able to, it helped us a bunch because the beer garden itself is kind of a tough view, whereas that roped off area, the stands, they get a better view of the game, but still allows us to control, you know, where the patrons are going to be.

293
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

294
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of corrals everybody, which is nice.

295
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:24,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it a lot easier, I would imagine.

296
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,409
[SPEAKER_01]: So that worked out well for you last year, obviously.

297
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really did.

298
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our crowds are pretty good and pretty respectful.

299
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:39,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, do we say to someone, hey, you can't stray with that glass of beer.

300
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,421
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone's been really respectful of our rules.

301
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:51,712
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great and I noticed too, that you get a decent crowd estimated 200 to 800 patrons.

302
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:55,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's going up every year as we get more and more traction.

303
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:57,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of.

304
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:03,002
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it's a tough weekend or we don't have a great opponent, it can be as low as 300.

305
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:08,404
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, we've got a really good schedule and we made the playoffs last year.

306
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:15,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we could be pushing that 400 to 500 per event pretty routinely, which is a good result for us.

307
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for Medford.

308
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really happy.

309
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:20,625
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

310
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:25,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And I trust that you did reach out to the police department for any details.

311
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:26,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we always do.

312
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:27,708
[SPEAKER_00]: We work closely with Kevin.

313
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,329
[SPEAKER_00]: We work closely with the Hormel Commission.

314
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:35,871
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also go before the council because we bring in five different food trucks.

315
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:38,212
[SPEAKER_00]: We did five last year.

316
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll do five or six this year.

317
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,074
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the Board of Health on board.

318
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,155
[SPEAKER_00]: We coordinate all that.

319
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,316
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor has been really supportive.

320
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:48,897
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been good.

321
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:50,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

322
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,138
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.

323
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't have any issues with it.

324
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, how about yourself?

325
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:59,302
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I haven't.

326
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any issues.

327
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:07,347
[SPEAKER_06]: The events, the same basically range kind of like past years.

328
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same thing.

329
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:16,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and there's a range of times of the day that we're doing it just to accommodate teams that are traveling to us.

330
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:24,230
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a flow where it's essentially a five hour event, but we really wrap up.

331
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,170
[SPEAKER_00]: way before that.

332
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been pretty good.

333
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:32,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, Kevin Bailey's team has been good.

334
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:34,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormel Commission's been good.

335
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,472
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it down to a good routine now.

336
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:38,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been fun.

337
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:39,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

338
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:40,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

339
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:41,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with it.

340
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you guys are back.

341
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:47,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you guys did this and then I was like hoping you wouldn't

342
00:20:48,662 --> 00:21:01,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing would remain, and I'm glad it has, and being able to be in the stands, having a drink while you're in the stands, so you can see the thing.

343
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:10,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it was a little bit of a leap of faith for us and for you all to let it happen, but it's, um, everyone behaved themselves.

344
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:14,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a, it's, you know, it's not a particularly rowdy bunch anyway.

345
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:19,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people shout for the, for the players, but it's not that kind of crowd.

346
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's pretty respectful of what's going on over here.

347
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, sure.

348
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have what, six of these, right?

349
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:31,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Six events?

350
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Six of these, yep.

351
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:34,229
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new brewer.

352
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,410
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going straight with Night Shift.

353
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:45,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we had kind of a middle tier brewer who served other people's beer, but this year, we're going straight with Night Shift Brewery.

354
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,094
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own TIP certified staff.

355
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:49,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.

356
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited for the partnership with them.

357
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, they're good.

358
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:55,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty local.

359
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:56,555
[SPEAKER_06]: They're good.

360
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:57,016
[SPEAKER_06]: They're good.

361
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,941
[SPEAKER_06]: They're okay.

362
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:03,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would make a, I can make a motion to approve these Bob, unless you have more questions, Bob.

363
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,513
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I actually have all the six dates and times and everything here.

364
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:11,113
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do it?

365
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:12,775
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to make the motion?

366
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

367
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:20,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I know because we would have had to do a lot of shuffling with the different dates and papers, but yeah, I can make the motion.

368
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a motion to approve the six one-day licenses to Boston Glory.

369
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:35,071
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Jason Tellerman, um, for six sporting events, uh, located at Harmel Stadium.

370
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:39,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we can approve all six at once.

371
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:44,296
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is for, um, April 26th from 5 to 10 p.m.

372
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,317
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is May 4th from 3 to 10 p.m.

373
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,539
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one is May 17th from 5 p.m.

374
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:49,759
[SPEAKER_01]: to 10 p.m.

375
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,949
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one is June 2nd from 11 a.m.

376
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:00,229
[SPEAKER_01]: to 4 p.m.

377
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The fifth one is June 8th from 5 p.m.

378
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,010
[SPEAKER_01]: to 10 p.m.

379
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sixth one is June 22nd from 5 p.m.

380
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:08,293
[SPEAKER_01]: to 10 p.m.

381
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's it.

382
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:22,830
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all of them.

383
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:31,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And just that one question, it's not really, but that one Saturday, May 4th, it says everything's like 5 to 10.

384
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:32,912
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's 3 to 10 p.m.

385
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any reason for that?

386
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that one.

387
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:41,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, because it's possible that we may change the time of the game.

388
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:44,874
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is slated to start at five.

389
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:53,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we are trying to push it to 10 if we can get Toronto, which is flying in to be a little more flexible.

390
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:58,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, it wouldn't be any more than 5 hours total.

391
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:02,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we can make that note or you all can make that note that.

392
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,149
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll either be a 3 to 8 or 5 to 10.

393
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,209
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 to 8 or 5%, okay.

394
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:15,112
[SPEAKER_06]: If we just make that note, then that's, and you guys abide by that, then that's- 100%.

395
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm okay with that then.

396
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:25,420
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, then I will accept that motion made by Commissioner Delfano.

397
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,161
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, call in favor.

398
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:28,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

399
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:29,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

400
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, motion passes.

401
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all set, Jake.

402
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:34,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

403
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:35,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

404
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much.

405
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:37,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope we see you out at game.

406
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:40,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to Daria as well for all of her help on this stuff.

407
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:43,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

408
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:44,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it's a good season.

409
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:45,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you very much.

410
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:46,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you.

411
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's see.

412
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:59,351
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we have Brian.

413
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:01,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you there?

414
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:03,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, team.

415
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,186
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

416
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:05,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.

417
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:08,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.

418
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:12,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I take it you heard my little speech at the beginning.

419
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

420
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to talk about next next month.

421
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:18,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to try and keep.

422
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:32,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just one day licenses, but all business that we have to vote on has to be in to apply by the 48 hour law, open public meeting law.

423
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:39,602
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to go on the agenda and anything on the agenda we have to vote for.

424
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be within that time frame.

425
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:48,509
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody called you up last minute, you got to explain to them that you can't put it in.

426
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,611
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to when we speak about it next month.

427
00:25:55,091 --> 00:26:10,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna see if we can set some hourly limits, a cutoff date, because a lot of times there's a Monday holiday, and if they on in by a certain time on Friday, it just affects everything.

428
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:15,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it doesn't, we don't wanna have any more issues.

429
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So we,

430
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:30,072
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to let you, that's why I kind of kept you and Heather near the end, just so you get a little gist of it that we talked about it earlier and kind of give you a heads up.

431
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:32,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be familiar with it.

432
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:39,574
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, the ones, you know, the one that you submitted, we're cool with doing that today.

433
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,714
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem at all.

434
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:45,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I've got it.

435
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,256
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell us a little bit about the event if you like.

436
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:52,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, it's actually, it's becoming a monthly event.

437
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,924
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you, we've been doing it for a while.

438
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:58,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last month, we did it with a one day license as well.

439
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's growing.

440
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's become kind of a series.

441
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:07,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the gaming, the FIFA themed gaming, gaming event.

442
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so we sold out last time, we're pretty much sold out for this next one.

443
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:14,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

444
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:15,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

445
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,583
[SPEAKER_01]: The new drawing too, which is good.

446
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:22,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very good.

447
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:23,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Very professional.

448
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

449
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:25,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting there.

450
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:44,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually looking for a local establishment to host something at the end of, excuse me, at the end of the year, probably like October, November, and we'll do like a big event there, you know, because I think, uh, I think we'd be too small to do an annual event of it.

451
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,002
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, it was a great thing.

452
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:46,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

453
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:48,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

454
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:49,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

455
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as usual, you know, everything is in order.

456
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,241
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that we have your insurance certificate on file.

457
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:04,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I say, the drawing, the updated drawing was very good.

458
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:07,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any issues.

459
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:09,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, how about yourself?

460
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I, uh, sounds like it's a good event and you're coming back for more.

461
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, so cool.

462
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:20,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with it.

463
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:22,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby.

464
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:23,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

465
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:25,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the drawing, it was for Tufts.

466
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, there was two of them, Derry.

467
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:33,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe one for Tufts and one for event them.

468
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get the one for event them?

469
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you sent us the event then one.

470
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was like with Brian's other attachment.

471
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:51,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and it's as a JPEG, it's as a JPEG, not a PDF.

472
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:52,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

473
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:52,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

474
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:53,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't print for me.

475
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:55,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

476
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:56,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm looking at it.

477
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:58,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks good.

478
00:28:58,949 --> 00:28:59,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

479
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:03,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would make a motion if that's all right, Commissioner.

480
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

481
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can move this one along.

482
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I will make and then we have the insurance and everything on file.

483
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:17,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to go with the assumption of that.

484
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:26,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll make a motion to accept the one-day license for Sunday, April 14th from 1 to 7 p.m.

485
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for Event Them, 344 Salem Street, Medford.

486
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:34,210
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for their FIFA video game event.

487
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I second the motion.

488
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:37,633
[SPEAKER_01]: All in favor?

489
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

490
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good, the motion passes, good luck.

491
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:44,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks guys, thanks everyone.

492
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:45,535
[SPEAKER_01]: See you Ryan.

493
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:46,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

494
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:53,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, next on the agenda do we have Heather from Tufts?

495
00:29:59,286 --> 00:29:59,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Heather West?

496
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:02,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody from Tufts?

497
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Samara from Tufts.

498
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:06,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

499
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:13,878
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this is for the senior bingo.

500
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:17,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little something about the event?

501
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

502
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:22,244
[SPEAKER_10]: We did this event, I think, back in December as well.

503
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:24,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a pretty tame event.

504
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have food.

505
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:29,630
[SPEAKER_10]: They will be checked in.

506
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: They will only be allowing people that are of age and that are seniors.

507
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:40,685
[SPEAKER_10]: They will only have 1 entrance as you can probably see on the floor plan there.

508
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:46,488
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have tough police detail here on site.

509
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:57,133
[SPEAKER_10]: The only caveat with this event is that unfortunately, there was a mix up and my coworkers submitted the incorrect date.

510
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:58,894
[SPEAKER_10]: It is actually a day before.

511
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So I need to know what.

512
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,904
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to do to kind of rectify that is actually on Thursday, March 28th.

513
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's the prior day.

514
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Daria, how do you suggest we handle that?

515
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:25,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we just pencil that in and grant the license for that, so they don't have to make out a whole new application?

516
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:31,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's fine, because in our minutes, we'll say March 28th, Thursday.

517
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 28th.

518
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:34,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

519
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:36,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds easy.

520
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:43,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can correct it on our end, and like Daria says, in the minutes, it'll be in there, so it'll be fine.

521
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:45,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate it.

522
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:47,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem.

523
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:54,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And you heard my little speech at the beginning or no about submitting the one day licenses.

524
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,597
[SPEAKER_10]: End of it.

525
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:14,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, basically what's been happening lately is we've been getting inundated with the last minute licenses, one day licenses and are basically anything renewals, change of managers, stuff like that.

526
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:20,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is they have to be in 48 hours before the actual meeting.

527
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:25,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the agenda can be posted and, um,

528
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:33,036
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we don't, we're going to be in violation of the law if we don't post the agenda for 48 hours prior.

529
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So next month, we're going to discuss it at that meeting that we're going to be strictly enforcing this from this point forward.

530
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:57,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if we're going to set a cut off date, maybe sometime on Friday, the Friday before, just in case there's a Monday holiday or something so that we can comply with the open meeting law and.

531
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:05,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be unfortunate, but any last minute, a day or two before, we can't do it.

532
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't be able to accept it till the following month.

533
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: With us, Daria's got a lot to do.

534
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,125
[SPEAKER_01]: She wears a couple of hats at City Hall.

535
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:25,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be very frustrating for not only her, but for us, because we have to read all of this stuff.

536
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:32,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff isn't as simple as a one day license, but legally it has to be posted.

537
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:35,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the heads up we just wanted to give you.

538
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:44,628
[SPEAKER_01]: So for next month, if anything should be arising, just make sure you get it in like the Friday before meetings.

539
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:47,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.

540
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:48,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

541
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:53,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, I saw senior bingo and I'm saying, jeez, I only live around the corner.

542
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:55,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll go play some senior bingo.

543
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:58,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a senior, but I think you meant the seniors are tough.

544
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, so much of that.

545
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:04,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only kidding.

546
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:05,869
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's fine.

547
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything looks good.

548
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:14,391
[SPEAKER_01]: My question to you was, obviously, you have been in touch with the Tufts PD for details.

549
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, Ben, I don't have any issues.

550
00:34:18,152 --> 00:34:18,852
[SPEAKER_01]: How about yourself?

551
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:21,772
[SPEAKER_06]: No, looks good.

552
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:23,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Good name, Senior Bingo.

553
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:24,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

554
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:27,733
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm okay with it.

555
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:29,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So Thursday, March 28th.

556
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:33,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

557
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,831
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make the motion if you like.

558
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:41,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

559
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll make a motion to accept the one-day license.

560
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:53,802
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for March 28th, 2024 for the event called Senior Bingo for Tufts Catering and Dining.

561
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:00,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on these plans and the insurance that we have on file.

562
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:03,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

563
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:05,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I will second that motion.

564
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:06,498
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

565
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:08,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

566
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

567
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:11,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, motion passes.

568
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:13,323
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all set.

569
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:14,965
[SPEAKER_01]: One day license has been issued.

570
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:16,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

571
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:18,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

572
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:19,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with the event.

573
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:20,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

574
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:23,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

575
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:27,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only thing I see left would be Semolina.

576
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct, Daria?

577
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:29,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

[SPEAKER_01]: Christina, yeah.

585
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:37,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Christina.

586
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:42,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little bit about what's going on?

587
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,391
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're requesting today?

588
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:51,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you approve a change of stock interest.

589
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:54,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so...

590
00:35:56,978 --> 00:36:03,981
[SPEAKER_09]: My partner Dave and I, Dave is starting the process of retiring.

591
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:21,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we, over the past couple of years, have been working on some succession plans for both of our businesses, for Dave's in Somerville and us in Semolina here.

592
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:39,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, uh, that's involved, um, working with, uh, some long time employees that we want to, um, uh, you know, lock down and, and incentivize them.

593
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:46,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, uh, cause I don't have kids and Dave's kids, uh, don't aren't interested.

594
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:47,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

595
00:36:48,843 --> 00:37:11,908
[SPEAKER_09]: our goal is to have this restaurant uh you know last past my working uh lifetime and bruno and jackie are both uh bruno's been here since day one even before and jackie's been here for uh you know four or so years now and um

596
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:42,335
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah we're making them both part you know minority partners share with bruno's 10 going to be 10 now jackie's going to be five percent that's great yes very good it's uh it's good that you know today especially like you said you have some good help there and some good people you want to hang on to them absolutely very very difficult to do nowadays but um that's a smart way of doing it i guess

597
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:49,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I, Ben, do you, did you have a chance to read over?

598
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:50,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, it was a lot.

599
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:52,611
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot, I know.

600
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like, yeah, so in basically- Lawyer's very thorough.

601
00:37:56,135 --> 00:38:02,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, I mean, it looks like in a contract, you know, it looks like a, you know, multiple contracts.

602
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:03,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, so it's 20 shares,

603
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:09,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's five shares being sold.

604
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:13,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I can kind of easily lay it out.

605
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dave and I were 60-40 partners.

606
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:18,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 60%, he's 40%.

607
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:25,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he, as he's retiring, he's selling off 20 of his shares.

608
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: 20%, 20, same thing, there's 100 total.

609
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not issuing any new shares.

610
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:44,727
[SPEAKER_09]: um so i i bought five of them and bruno bought five like wrote a check for it and then i am financing um

611
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Bruno and Jackie each to buy the remaining 10 from Dave.

612
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:58,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dave's share drops down to 20.

613
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine jumped up to 65.

614
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Bruno is 10, Jackie is five.

615
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:18,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of that paperwork was the promissory notes between myself and Jackie and myself and Bruno about the loan for them to buy the shares.

616
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:25,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so yeah, there I.

617
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I have money saved for a project down the road, and I thought it was a good way to get them on board and to help them, because neither of them has that kind of cash to just write that much of a check to date.

618
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:50,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

619
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:52,349
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

620
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:52,849
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

621
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks for that explanation.

622
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it makes sense.

623
00:39:59,473 --> 00:39:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good.

624
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:03,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you guys are doing that and keeping...

625
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:07,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm keeping.

626
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it just for Semolina or is for Dave's Pasta too or it's just, it's just.

627
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:12,418
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just Semolina.

628
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:15,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It's two completely separate businesses.

629
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:26,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We are coincidentally going through the same process at Dave's because our other partner that's just involved with Dave's is, we're doing sort of the same thing with him.

630
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,687
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a longtime employee and he's buying shares from Dave.

631
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:34,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a little convoluted, but.

632
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

633
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this just pertains just to some of them, which is what I was like.

634
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:46,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jackie and Bruno don't have any interest and it's just here.

635
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:48,775
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

636
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:49,415
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

637
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:53,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure this took quite a little while to get it all.

638
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:58,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, point where it's submitted to us and we're seeing everything and I'm not.

639
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:05,027
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I can tell, nothing is missing your explanation sort of matches with what I'm seeing.

640
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:08,453
[SPEAKER_06]: from a non-legally trained eye.

641
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:11,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have any problem with it.

642
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:16,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one issue, Mr. Commissioner.

643
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I had noticed on page 29 of PDF number two is a

644
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:41,553
[SPEAKER_01]: DUA certificate, and the DUA certificate is expired.

645
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:48,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that these things are a pain.

646
00:41:49,515 --> 00:42:01,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It's issued January 30th, and it expires on February 28th, which doesn't give you much time to get to us with a unexpired certificate.

647
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:22,849
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm willing to do, Mr. Commissioner, is approve the change of stock interest with the condition that a new certificate be issued to Daria before she submits this to the ABCC.

648
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:32,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just, you know, the reason why it's because we just had earlier with the ocean.

649
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I think because we were trying to get on the earlier, remember Daria, we're trying to get on the February meeting.

650
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:44,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, yeah, so we had put all this.

651
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:50,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we put everything together a long time ago, but yeah, I can get that.

652
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:51,959
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

653
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because the only reason is Bobby has a good point.

654
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:56,321
[SPEAKER_07]: They.

655
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:03,024
[SPEAKER_07]: The ABCC, if it's like, not within the 30 days that they get it to, it's not considered valid.

656
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can send that to me and I'll submit it when you get it to me, that's fine.

657
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:08,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

658
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,463
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, I can get Jackie and Bruno up here.

659
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:18,869
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the middle of lunch, so they're down there.

660
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,414
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you need to talk to them, I can grab them.

661
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm satisfied.

662
00:43:25,612 --> 00:43:29,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything, you know, like Ben said, we're not legal experts.

663
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:30,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks fine.

664
00:43:31,753 --> 00:43:42,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the documents that we normally see on a monthly basis, like the DUA certificate and other documents like that, it's pretty easy for us to pick out.

665
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:45,376
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that

666
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:48,158
[SPEAKER_01]: the ABCC had kicked this back to Daria.

667
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:53,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we can approve it contingent upon a valid certificate.

668
00:43:53,522 --> 00:44:03,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Daria says, the sooner the better, because it'll give her a time to get it out to the ABCC before the new one expires, you know?

669
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

670
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:08,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're pretty quick when you apply for it.

671
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:13,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you get an email like a little while later or something.

672
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:15,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.

673
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:19,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, other than that, I don't have any issues with it.

674
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:25,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, did you want to, was there anything else or do you want to make a motion?

675
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,652
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's good.

676
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I will make a motion.

677
00:44:31,773 --> 00:44:32,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

678
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:38,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So CTDG.

679
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:39,637
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ.

680
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ, sorry.

681
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:44,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Ink.

682
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Ink is similar to kitchen.

683
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:50,312
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

684
00:44:51,293 --> 00:45:10,184
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I will make a motion to approve or accept this change of stock interest application based on these five documents that we have here for the stocks being sold.

685
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:15,017
[SPEAKER_06]: for CTDJ Inc.

686
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:17,258
[SPEAKER_06]: doing business as Semolina Kitchen.

687
00:45:17,278 --> 00:45:27,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I will make a motion to approve or accept, I think rather, these applications.

688
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, pending the valid... Yeah.

689
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:33,187
[SPEAKER_01]: ...way certificate.

690
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:33,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

691
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

692
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:38,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I will second that motion.

693
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:40,832
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

694
00:45:41,878 --> 00:45:41,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

695
00:45:42,919 --> 00:45:43,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

696
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, your application has been approved.

697
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:48,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thanks so much.

698
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Dari, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

699
00:45:51,224 --> 00:45:52,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty, good luck to you.

700
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,225
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

701
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:57,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Just email it to me and then I will add it to the application.

702
00:45:58,488 --> 00:45:59,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

703
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:00,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

704
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

705
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:10,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think that just about does it for us, correct?

706
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.

707
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:13,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

708
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:23,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you may be thinking about, Ben, or anything that's come up now?

709
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:28,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, since you guys last saw me, we had a baby that came early last week.

710
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good for you.

711
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

712
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm home this week, yep.

713
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:35,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, baby girl Cassidy.

714
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:36,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

715
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:37,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

716
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:39,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Which number is that?

717
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, three?

718
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:40,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

719
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

720
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:42,611
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless you.

721
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:43,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

722
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:45,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

723
00:46:45,412 --> 00:46:46,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're upstairs.

724
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:46,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm home.

725
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:51,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to... I saw Alan bailed last minute.

726
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want to have to have this whole thing rescheduled.

727
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:58,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're done, I've got plenty to do right now.

728
00:46:58,596 --> 00:46:59,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, everything's good.

729
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:01,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good.

730
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:02,217
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

731
00:47:02,457 --> 00:47:03,058
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

732
00:47:03,098 --> 00:47:03,818
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.

733
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:04,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

734
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:15,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and next month we'll discuss this whole last minute thing, the 48-hour meeting law and all that stuff.

735
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:23,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe we can, in the meantime, just in our heads, put together something, maybe a deadline or whatever.

736
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:27,065
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I think everything else is running pretty smoothly.

737
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:31,408
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing pending that we're working on, and I think we're good.

738
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:33,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

739
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:34,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

740
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:35,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that Friday deadline.

741
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:39,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, yeah, we can, we can have, yeah.

742
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:43,101
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was going to say holiday, right?

743
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:44,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

744
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: My Friday anyways, just more reasonable Monday morning, everything piles up.

745
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:49,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more.

746
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:50,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

747
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:50,827
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

748
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:51,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

749
00:47:51,147 --> 00:47:57,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause Monday morning it's like everything from the weekend, like it like hits you sometimes.

750
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And right.

751
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:58,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

752
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Friday is better because then it gives me time to put it all together, send it to you guys, and then just get it your way too, and then you have time to review it and all that good stuff too.

753
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:17,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that'd be good.

754
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:20,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this chair thing ain't as easy as it looks.

755
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:28,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I remember half the stuff I was supposed to say.

756
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: You were good.

757
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:37,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some notes just in case from one of Jim's meetings, and I said, just in case I have to cover it.

758
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'll read the last line to end the meeting.

759
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:43,273
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have.

760
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else?

761
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:46,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a motion to adjourn.

762
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:47,654
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

763
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:48,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

764
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's been accepted.

765
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:54,181
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

766
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:54,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well done.
