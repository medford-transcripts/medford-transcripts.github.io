    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=0.499">Okay,</a>  the public meeting, the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for March 20th, 24th will come to order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=13.468">We</a>  do have an agenda to follow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=15.95">And</a>  the first thing on the agenda is to approve the minutes of last month's meeting, plus we have <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=27.645">some</a>  additional minutes that were sent to us by Gary to approve as well.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=36.952">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=38.473">Agreed.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=39.874">Alrighty.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=41.375">Why</a>  don't we start with last month's minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=46.278">I</a>  did have a chance to review them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=49.821">They</a>  looked perfectly fine to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=53.183">Ben,</a>  I don't know if you had a chance to check it out.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=56.983">Yep,</a>  Commissioner, I did have a chance to check them out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=61.146">I</a>  saw the minutes from January 11th and then the other minutes from February 21st and they were really detailed and those were, you know, fairly extensive meetings and from everything I can remember, they look accurate and they look good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=78.78">So</a>  thanks Darya.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=81.158">Yes,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=83.698">It</a>  was a lot of work, especially we did cover a lot of stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=90.12">So</a>  that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=90.9">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=92.98">So</a>  what we can do is approve the minutes for the February 21st meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=102.122">Ben,</a>  if you want to make a motion for the minutes.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=106.462">Can</a>  I approve them both? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=107.903">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=108.043">Make</a>  a motion for both? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=109.003">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=109.809">Yeah,</a>  so I'm going to make a motion to approve the minutes for the two meetings we've had so far this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=117.614">The</a>  first one is for the January 11, 2024 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=123.577">The</a>  second one is for the February 21, 2024 minutes for the License Commission meeting.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=132.422">OK,</a>  I second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=134.823">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=135.784">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=139.778">The</a>  motion to accept the minutes is an order and those are all squared away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=149.841">What</a>  I'd like to do, Ben, if it's okay with you is just go a little out of order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=157.083">Yeah,</a>  it's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=159.103">On</a>  the agenda because we have a couple that are going to involve a little bit of time and we don't want to tie too many people up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=165.932">But</a>  what we also have to do is, well, what I'd like to start with is new business first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=177.161">The</a>  only reason being is that we seem to be having an issue lately with people coming to this commission for not only one-day licenses, but other items as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=195.378">and</a>  they're coming in after the 48-hour round agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=205.221">The</a>  agenda's got to be posted 48 hours by law before the meeting, and we are not allowed to vote on anything unless it's on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=216.665">So</a>  when we're receiving <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=219.425">applications</a>  for one day licenses or anything else that's coming in the day of or a day before, it's not good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=231.805">And</a>  we shouldn't be voting on it unless it's on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=235.647">So</a>  what I was going to say is maybe we can have Daria put on next month's agenda that we can make a motion to strictly enforce the 48-hour rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=250.236">And</a>  maybe set even a deadline, you know, for the Friday prior, because sometimes you have a Monday holiday and she can't get legally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=260.651">We</a>  can't we don't have enough time for the 48 hour rule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=265.029">uh</a>  the open meeting law rule so i i would suggest that maybe just put it on the agenda that we can talk about it next month when the chairman's here as well and um and from that point forward um we can enforce it i know we had a couple today um and and you know i don't think we i don't have a problem with putting them through but <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=287.883">It's</a>  very difficult, especially we've got a couple of fairly large things today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=292.944">It</a>  took me a while to read through a lot of this paperwork, so we can't get it an hour or two before it's not going to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=301.247">Plus</a>  Daria, God bless her, she's wonderful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=305.828">She's</a>  doing a regular job at City Hall as well as handling this stuff for us and keeping everything in order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=312.89">She's</a>  what makes everything work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=315.611">It's</a>  even doing a, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=317.331">I</a>  would imagine a strain on down here as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=320.112">So</a>  anyways, that's enough for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=322.934">So</a>  that was the new business that I had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=325.755">Do</a>  you have any new business?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=328.076">No,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=329.317">We</a>  wanna process a lot of business in here and we just need them in on time so that we can get them on the agenda and just get it done right and help everybody out the best we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=339.942">So</a>  no, I'm totally in favor of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=341.703">So</a>  say we add that to next month and we'll move on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=345.104">Okay,</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=347.722">All</a>  righty, let's see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=352.185">Next</a>  item on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=356.708">I</a>  am going to go to, we have Leilani from the Medford Public Library.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=366.996">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=368.537">Hi,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=369.157">Did</a>  I say your name right, Leilani?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=371.399">Yes,</a>  perfect, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=373.346">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=374.967">Could</a>  you tell us a little bit about what's going on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=377.508">I</a>  know you're looking for a one-day license at the library.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=381.811">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=382.471">So</a>  it's the same event we did last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=384.812">It's</a>  our trivia night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=387.213">We're</a>  expecting about 100 people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=389.154">They</a>  will all be pre-sold tickets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=391.636">It's</a>  a fundraiser, Saturday, May 4th in the evening, and just beer and wine and volunteers that are pouring beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=403.42">Just</a>  snacks, nothing substantial food wise.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=407.346">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=408.869">And</a>  we know you folks always do a really good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=413.736">You've</a>  sent us layouts of the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=417.108">of</a>  the functions and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=419.81">It's</a>  all good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=422.092">You</a>  also, I believe we have on file your insurance for that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=428.477">Exactly,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=430.218">Yeah,</a>  I don't have an issue with any of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=433.501">Ben,</a>  how about yourself?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=435.887">No,</a>  I concur. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=437.99">You</a>  guys have never had any problems, and we're happy that you're having good events at the library, great space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=444.357">So</a>  I'm good with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=448.201">I</a>  can make a motion to move this one along.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=558.892">No,</a>  no, we discussed it and I'm in agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=563.354">I</a>  think we're fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=564.715">We're</a>  good to go there.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=566.227">Okay,</a>  if you want to make a motion to accept the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=569.968">The</a>  certificate from motion state job lot, we should be good to go.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=575.21">Yeah,</a>  so let me just word this correctly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=578.491">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=578.871">Um,</a>  where are they. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=587.474">So,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=589.967">Could</a>  I just make one suggestion here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=591.428">This</a>  may help out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=592.408">I</a>  think we need, and you can certainly correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we need a motion if the commission is willing to approve the applicant, the change in manager application, the DOA certificate was just that we didn't have it the last time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=607.015">And</a>  I don't, so I don't know that it was ever approved.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=611.877">It</a>  was approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=612.637">It</a>  was approved last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=613.837">Oh,</a>  I see.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=614.477">And</a>  then the commission rejected it because of the DUA certification?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=617.098">No,</a>  the commission approved it, but it was the ABCC that rejected it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=621.319">Oh,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=622.779">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=623.479">And</a>  they worked with Nicole, but they never got anything in a timely manner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=630.34">So</a>  that's why they said that this would be a consideration from them to get the, once they get the updated DUA certificate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=638.182">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=638.682">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=639.923">So,</a>  once once we approve that area, you send it back to the and it gets approved through them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=646.066">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=646.766">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=648.727">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=649.728">And</a>  so we already, because the manager, we already looked at that.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=654.41">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that was all that was like, back in August of last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=658.672">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=659.733">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=660.233">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=661.814">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=666.788">Sorry,</a>  there's a lot of paperwork on this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=669.289">I'm</a>  just trying to pull up the... Okay, so we're going to... I'm going to make a motion that this commission is going to favorably approve the DUA certificate that was provided to us from ABCC for Ocean State Job Lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=689.229">at</a>  30 Commercial Street in Medford that completes the change of manager process, which we already approved.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=699.351">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=700.292">I</a>  will second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=703.232">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=706.193">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=708.234">Motion's</a>  been approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=709.674">You're</a>  good to go, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=741.103">So</a>  this is an event we have had for many years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=744.466">It</a>  is a $300 raffle, elimination raffle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=749.07">And</a>  then we want to serve beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=751.773">We'll</a>  have some snacks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=754.115">We're</a>  expecting about 200 people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=756.477">It's</a>  on April 5th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=758.87">And</a>  it is people buy $100 ticket, and then the last couple standing either split the raffle or the last number drawn wins the $10,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=768.975">So</a>  it's a $10,000 prize.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=956.828">Yeah,</a>  if you don't need it, I just wanted to make sure that if someone comes in, I used to post it like I would put it in a little frame by the bar, just to say we're legit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=967.475">But</a>  as long as it's okay with you guys, I don't have that up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=969.957">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=970.677">It's</a>  whatever.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=971.098">Yeah,</a>  nobody has that issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=972.779">So</a>  I don't okay, unless they asked me for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=975.341">I</a>  don't give it because we know it's approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=978.142">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=979.023">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=979.623">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=980.024">So</a>  now minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=981.144">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=984.307">I</a>  hope it's a good one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=985.708">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=992.725">Okay,</a>  moving right along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=997.309">Representative</a>  from Boston Glory, are you here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1001.834">That's</a>  me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1002.955">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1004.336">And</a>  what is your name, sir?</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1005.918">Jay</a>  Tallerman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1007.219">I'm</a>  one of the owners of Boston Glory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1010.682">This</a>  is year four for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1013.846">Okay,</a>  so you're back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1015.81">We're</a>  back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1016.952">Yeah,</a>  made the playoffs last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1019.036">We're</a>  back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1020.318">We</a>  had a good year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1021.179">No</a>  incidents again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1026.008">Happy</a>  to be back.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1028.481">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1029.621">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1031.622">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1031.922">And</a>  this is basically just the series of events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1035.623">And</a>  we have, I have the 6 states here and the times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1042.965">The</a>  only question I had what I really like is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1049.108">the</a>  layout you sent to us that you keep the alcohol in one section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1056.271">And</a>  I think you guys were the first ones that did it last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1060.653">It's</a>  when I saw it is that you rope off a portion of the stands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1064.575">So</a>  now people want to sit and have a refreshment while they're watching the game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1069.657">They're</a>  contained just to that area, which is- Right.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1073.199">We</a>  were really thankful that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1075.98">you</a>  know, between Kevin Bailey and the Hormel Commission and you all, we were able to, it helped us a bunch because the beer garden itself is kind of a tough view, whereas that roped off area, the stands, they get a better view of the game, but still allows us to control, you know, where the patrons are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1097.402">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1098.323">And</a>  it kind of corrals everybody, which is nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1100.805">And</a>  it makes it a lot easier, I would imagine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1104.547">So</a>  that worked out well for you last year, obviously.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1107.449">Yeah,</a>  it really did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1108.41">Again,</a>  our crowds are pretty good and pretty respectful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1111.593">Every</a>  once in a while, do we say to someone, hey, you can't stray with that glass of beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1119.639">But</a>  everyone's been really respectful of our rules.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1123.521">That's</a>  great and I noticed too, that you get a decent crowd estimated 200 to 800 patrons.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1131.973">Yeah,</a>  and it's going up every year as we get more and more traction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1135.978">So</a>  we've kind of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1138.661">You</a>  know, when it's a tough weekend or we don't have a great opponent, it can be as low as 300. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1143.062">But</a>  this year, we've got a really good schedule and we made the playoffs last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1148.504">So</a>  we think we could be pushing that 400 to 500 per event pretty routinely, which is a good result for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1156.766">Good</a>  for Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1158.287">So</a>  we're really happy.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1160.005">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1160.765">And</a>  I trust that you did reach out to the police department for any details.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1165.227">Yeah,</a>  we always do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1166.288">We</a>  work closely with Kevin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1167.748">We</a>  work closely with the Hormel Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1170.849">And</a>  then we also go before the council because we bring in five different food trucks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1176.772">We</a>  did five last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1178.232">I</a>  don't know if we'll do five or six this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1180.733">So</a>  we got the Board of Health on board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1183.515">We</a>  coordinate all that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1185.755">The</a>  mayor has been really supportive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1187.876">So</a>  it's been good.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1189.797">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1190.417">That</a>  sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1192.759">Yeah,</a>  no, I don't have any issues with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1194.84">Ben,</a>  how about yourself?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1197.681">No,</a>  no, I haven't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1199.342">I</a>  don't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1202.344">The</a>  events, the same basically range kind of like past years.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1208.2">Yeah,</a>  same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1209.701">I</a>  mean, and there's a range of times of the day that we're doing it just to accommodate teams that are traveling to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1217.526">But</a>  yeah, it's a flow where it's essentially a five hour event, but we really wrap up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1225.13">way</a>  before that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1226.37">So</a>  it's been pretty good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1230.231">Again,</a>  you know, Kevin Bailey's team has been good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1232.892">Hormel</a>  Commission's been good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1234.212">We</a>  have it down to a good routine now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1236.492">So</a>  it's been fun.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1239.613">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1240.213">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1240.733">I'm</a>  good with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1241.414">I'm</a>  glad you guys are back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1243.274">I</a>  remember you guys did this and then I was like hoping you wouldn't <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1248.662">The</a>  whole thing would remain, and I'm glad it has, and being able to be in the stands, having a drink while you're in the stands, so you can see the thing.</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1262.068">Yeah,</a>  you know, it was a little bit of a leap of faith for us and for you all to let it happen, but it's, um, everyone behaved themselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1270.173">And</a>  again, we have a, it's, you know, it's not a particularly rowdy bunch anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1274.256">I</a>  mean, people shout for the, for the players, but it's not that kind of crowd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1279.299">Everyone's</a>  pretty respectful of what's going on over here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1283.201">Yeah,</a>  yeah, sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1286.946">Okay,</a>  so we have what, six of these, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1291.288">Six</a>  events?</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1291.708">Six</a>  of these, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1293.028">We</a>  have a new brewer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1294.929">We're</a>  going straight with Night Shift. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1296.49">Last</a>  year, we had kind of a middle tier brewer who served other people's beer, but this year, we're going straight with Night Shift Brewery. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1305.513">They</a>  have their own TIP certified staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1308.735">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1309.275">And</a>  we're excited for the partnership with them.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1312.336">Yeah,</a>  I mean, they're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1314.971">Yeah,</a>  pretty local. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1316.114">They're</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1316.595">They're</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1317.036">They're</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1318.981">So</a>  I would make a, I can make a motion to approve these Bob, unless you have more questions, Bob.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1608.203">Sure,</a>  it's actually, it's becoming a monthly event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1613.044">To</a>  be honest with you, we've been doing it for a while. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1614.964">And</a>  then last month, we did it with a one day license as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1618.325">And</a>  it's just, it's growing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1621.166">So</a>  it's become kind of a series. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1622.806">It's</a>  the gaming, the FIFA themed gaming, gaming event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1629.127">And</a>  yeah, so we sold out last time, we're pretty much sold out for this next one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1633.568">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1635.449">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1638.321">The</a>  new drawing too, which is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1640.923">It</a>  looks very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1642.584">Very</a>  professional.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1644.326">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1644.706">It's</a>  getting there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1645.747">So</a>  we're actually looking for a local establishment to host something at the end of, excuse me, at the end of the year, probably like October, November, and we'll do like a big event there, you know, because I think, uh, I think we'd be too small to do an annual event of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1664.801">But,</a>  uh, yeah, it was a great thing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1666.042">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1668.278">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1669.098">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1670.519">Yeah,</a>  as usual, you know, everything is in order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1675.32">You</a>  know, I know that we have your insurance certificate on file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1680.441">And</a>  like I say, the drawing, the updated drawing was very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1684.762">I</a>  don't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1688.423">Ben,</a>  how about yourself?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1690.911">No,</a>  no, I, uh, sounds like it's a good event and you're coming back for more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1696.673">So,</a>  uh, so cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1699.474">I'm</a>  good with it.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001624_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1817.421">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1819.642">We</a>  did this event, I think, back in December as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1822.324">It</a>  is a pretty tame event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1825.166">We</a>  do have food. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1826.107">They</a>  will be checked in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1829.89">They</a>  will only be allowing people that are of age and that are seniors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1835.683">They</a>  will only have 1 entrance as you can probably see on the floor plan there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1842.606">We</a>  will have tough police detail here on site. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1848.049">The</a>  only caveat with this event is that unfortunately, there was a mix up and my coworkers submitted the incorrect date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1857.453">It</a>  is actually a day before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1859.854">So</a>  I need to know what. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1864.162">You</a>  need to do to kind of rectify that is actually on Thursday, March 28th.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1870.285">Okay,</a>  so it's the prior day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1875.96">Daria,</a>  how do you suggest we handle that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1878.802">Can</a>  we just pencil that in and grant the license for that, so they don't have to make out a whole new application?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1886.305">Yeah,</a>  I think that's fine, because in our minutes, we'll say March 28th, Thursday.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1891.407">Yeah,</a>  28th.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1894.269">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1895.589">Sounds</a>  easy.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1897.49">Yeah,</a>  we can correct it on our end, and like Daria says, in the minutes, it'll be in there, so it'll be fine.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001624_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1905.044">I</a>  really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1907.247">Not</a>  a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1908.508">And</a>  you heard my little speech at the beginning or no about submitting the one day licenses.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001624_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1914.534">End</a>  of it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1918.43">Okay,</a>  basically what's been happening lately is we've been getting inundated with the last minute licenses, one day licenses and are basically anything renewals, change of managers, stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1935.342">And</a>  what happens is they have to be in 48 hours before the actual meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1940.826">And</a>  so the agenda can be posted and, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1946.909">You</a>  know, if we don't, we're going to be in violation of the law if we don't post the agenda for 48 hours prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1953.917">So</a>  next month, we're going to discuss it at that meeting that we're going to be strictly enforcing this from this point forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1964.148">So,</a>  if we're going to set a cut off date, maybe sometime on Friday, the Friday before, just in case there's a Monday holiday or something so that we can comply with the open meeting law and. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1979.517">And</a>  it'll be unfortunate, but any last minute, a day or two before, we can't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1986.44">We</a>  won't be able to accept it till the following month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1991.542">With</a>  us, Daria's got a lot to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1996.004">She</a>  wears a couple of hats at City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=1999.465">And</a>  this can be very frustrating for not only her, but for us, because we have to read all of this stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2006.548">Most</a>  of the stuff isn't as simple as a one day license, but legally it has to be posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2012.114">So</a>  that was the heads up we just wanted to give you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2015.538">So</a>  for next month, if anything should be arising, just make sure you get it in like the Friday before meetings.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2024.808">Yeah,</a>  that makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2027.891">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2029.472">Yeah,</a>  so, you know, I saw senior bingo and I'm saying, jeez, I only live around the corner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2033.675">Maybe</a>  I'll go play some senior bingo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2035.496">I'm</a>  a senior, but I think you meant the seniors are tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2041.148">Okay,</a>  well, so much of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2043.809">I'm</a>  only kidding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2044.869">No,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2046.129">Yeah,</a>  everything looks good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2048.269">My</a>  question to you was, obviously, you have been in touch with the Tufts PD for details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2055.291">Other</a>  than that, Ben, I don't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2058.152">How</a>  about yourself?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2060.332">No,</a>  looks good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2062.132">Good</a>  name, Senior Bingo.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2064.313">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2065.253">No,</a>  I'm okay with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2068.674">So</a>  Thursday, March 28th.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2071.325">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2075.368">You</a>  can make the motion if you like.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2081.293">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2081.633">So</a>  I'll make a motion to accept the one-day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2084.435">This</a>  is for March 28th, 2024 for the event called Senior Bingo for Tufts Catering and Dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2097.245">Based</a>  on these plans and the insurance that we have on file.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2289.776">I</a>  can kind of easily lay it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2293.639">So</a>  Dave and I were 60-40 partners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2296.741">I</a>  was 60%, he's 40%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2299.063">And</a>  so he, as he's retiring, he's selling off 20 of his shares. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2305.527">20%,</a>  20, same thing, there's 100 total. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2307.049">So</a>  we're not issuing any new shares. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2313.694">um</a>  so i i bought five of them and bruno bought five like wrote a check for it and then i am financing um <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2328.787">Bruno</a>  and Jackie each to buy the remaining 10 from Dave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2335.589">So</a>  Dave's share drops down to 20. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2339.93">Mine</a>  jumped up to 65. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2343.15">Bruno</a>  is 10, Jackie is five. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2345.971">And</a>  a lot of that paperwork was the promissory notes between myself and Jackie and myself and Bruno about the loan for them to buy the shares. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2362.437">Okay,</a>  so yeah, there I. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2369.263">I</a>  have money saved for a project down the road, and I thought it was a good way to get them on board and to help them, because neither of them has that kind of cash to just write that much of a check to date.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2390.589">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2392.009">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2392.529">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2394.03">Yeah,</a>  thanks for that explanation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2396.11">Hey,</a>  it makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2399.473">It's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2399.834">I'm</a>  glad you guys are doing that and keeping... <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2406.415">Yeah,</a>  I'm keeping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2407.416">So</a>  is it just for Semolina or is for Dave's Pasta too or it's just, it's just.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2411.398">No,</a>  it's just Semolina. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2412.438">It's</a>  two completely separate businesses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2415.76">We</a>  are coincidentally going through the same process at Dave's because our other partner that's just involved with Dave's is, we're doing sort of the same thing with him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2426.966">He's</a>  a longtime employee and he's buying shares from Dave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2430.788">So,</a>  it's a little convoluted, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2435.01">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2436.045">Yeah,</a>  but this just pertains just to some of them, which is what I was like.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2440.108">So,</a>  Jackie and Bruno don't have any interest and it's just here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2448.354">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2448.995">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2449.495">Well,</a>  I'm sure this took quite a little while to get it all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2453.498">Yeah,</a>  point where it's submitted to us and we're seeing everything and I'm not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2459.863">From</a>  what I can tell, nothing is missing your explanation sort of matches with what I'm seeing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2466.852">from</a>  a non-legally trained eye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2468.693">And</a>  I don't have any problem with it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2473.856">I</a>  just have one issue, Mr. Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2478.64">I</a>  had noticed on page 29 of PDF number two is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2495.431">DUA</a>  certificate, and the DUA certificate is expired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2504.473">And</a>  I know that these things are a pain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2509.515">It's</a>  issued January 30th, and it expires on February 28th, which doesn't give you much time to get to us with a unexpired certificate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2523.538">What</a>  I'm willing to do, Mr. Commissioner, is approve the change of stock interest with the condition that a new certificate be issued to Daria before she submits this to the ABCC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2545.738">Yeah,</a>  I just, you know, the reason why it's because we just had earlier with the ocean.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2553.4">So,</a>  yeah, I think because we were trying to get on the earlier, remember Daria, we're trying to get on the February meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2561.902">And</a>  then, yeah, so we had put all this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2564.956">Yeah,</a>  we put everything together a long time ago, but yeah, I can get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2570.759">No</a>  problem.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2573.02">Yeah,</a>  because the only reason is Bobby has a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2575.941">They.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2577.362">The</a>  ABCC, if it's like, not within the 30 days that they get it to, it's not considered valid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2583.264">So</a>  if you can send that to me and I'll submit it when you get it to me, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2588.307">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2594.058">You</a>  guys, I can get Jackie and Bruno up here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2596.564">It's</a>  the middle of lunch, so they're down there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2598.929">But</a>  if you need to talk to them, I can grab them.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2602.851">Yeah,</a>  I'm satisfied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2605.612">Everything,</a>  you know, like Ben said, we're not legal experts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2609.973">Everything</a>  looks fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2611.753">Just</a>  the documents that we normally see on a monthly basis, like the DUA certificate and other documents like that, it's pretty easy for us to pick out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2623.936">But</a>  I know that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2625.996">the</a>  ABCC had kicked this back to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2628.478">And</a>  like I said, we can approve it contingent upon a valid certificate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2633.522">And</a>  like Daria says, the sooner the better, because it'll give her a time to get it out to the ABCC before the new one expires, you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2644.11">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2646.212">I</a>  think they're pretty quick when you apply for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2649.374">I</a>  think you get an email like a little while later or something.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2654.225">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2656.926">Yeah,</a>  other than that, I don't have any issues with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2661.729">Ben,</a>  did you want to, was there anything else or do you want to make a motion?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2666.911">No,</a>  I think it's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2669.772">Okay,</a>  so I will make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2671.773">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2674.555">So</a>  CTDG. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2679.337">DJ.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2682.167">DJ,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2825.092">Yeah,</a>  and next month we'll discuss this whole last minute thing, the 48-hour meeting law and all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2835.698">But</a>  maybe we can, in the meantime, just in our heads, put together something, maybe a deadline or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2844.003">But</a>  other than that, I think everything else is running pretty smoothly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2847.105">There's</a>  nothing pending that we're working on, and I think we're good.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2860.739">No,</a>  I was going to say holiday, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2863.241">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2864.502">My</a>  Friday anyways, just more reasonable Monday morning, everything piles up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2869.346">It's</a>  more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2869.966">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2879.28">I</a>  feel like Friday is better because then it gives me time to put it all together, send it to you guys, and then just get it your way too, and then you have time to review it and all that good stuff too.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2895.706">Yeah,</a>  I think that'd be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2898.127">Well,</a>  this chair thing ain't as easy as it looks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2903.584">I</a>  think I remember half the stuff I was supposed to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2908.286">You</a>  were good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2909.447">I</a>  made some notes just in case from one of Jim's meetings, and I said, just in case I have to cover it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2918.11">Actually,</a>  I'll read the last line to end the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2922.292">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2923.353">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2925.093">I</a>  make a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2926.654">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2928.335">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2929.867">I</a>  mean, it's been accepted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2933.799">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-03-20-24&start=2934.221">Well,</a>  well done.</p>
