1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:10,457
[SPEAKER_12]: So I am going to call to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, 6.30 p.m.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:19,121
[SPEAKER_12]: We are meeting this evening at Medford's Department of Public Works at 21 James Street and hybrid via Zoom.

3
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:28,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will ensure that the meeting is recorded as quickly as possible and posted after this meeting is over.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,964
[SPEAKER_12]: And so first on the agenda, we have an off-cycle application from Shiloh Baptist Church.

5
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:42,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So... I do have... Oops.

6
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:47,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I just realized I didn't actually hit admit all.

7
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:48,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, folks.

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:50,730
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

9
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:53,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jerry is coming.

10
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:06,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So for those who just entered the room, I just called a meeting, the Community Preservation Committee meeting.

11
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:12,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And our first item on the agenda is the off-cycle application review for Shiloh Baptist Church.

12
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe we have some people here to introduce this project.

13
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,850
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will turn it over to you all.

14
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how you want to

15
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:26,793
[SPEAKER_12]: how you want to proceed.

16
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:33,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to talk about the project yourselves or at the architect?

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:44,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like you might still be trying to turn your audio down.

18
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to introduce myself.

19
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, everyone.

20
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Yulia Borovsky.

21
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the camera?

22
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Who am I waving at?

23
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:56,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Right there.

24
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,627
[SPEAKER_10]: That little device sitting on the table.

25
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,308
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like a Star Wars material.

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,589
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

27
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:04,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, everyone.

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,610
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Yulia Borovsky.

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I am the director and owner of the Bonsai Learning Academy.

30
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:23,519
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have been working with Cliff and the team for the last year to see if the church could be a suitable fit for the daycare expansion that has been my goal for the last two years.

31
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:34,222
[SPEAKER_10]: desperately trying to find a suitable commercial type space to grow the daycare in Medford.

32
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:42,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had my space for almost nine years now, and I'm very much rooted in the community.

33
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:50,915
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a wonderful reputation, but we just need more physical space to provide that much needed childcare for the

34
00:02:52,403 --> 00:03:05,228
[SPEAKER_10]: grow in City of Medford because I, you know, even in the last nine years myself, I've seen so many changes in the demographics and the new families coming in and moving into the area.

35
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:11,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm super excited about this partnership and about all of the opportunities that have been coming our way.

36
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:16,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to come back and learn more from you about the daycare.

37
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:22,872
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I do want to give an opportunity for the other members of the team, the Shiloh team, to introduce yourselves while you're here.

38
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:29,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Cliff Singleton, chair slash president of the Shiloh Baptist Church.

39
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

40
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: William McIntyre, our trustee on that board, Shiloh Baptist Church.

41
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:36,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

42
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have Jerry.

43
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:46,217
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have some introductions first and then we'll have you give a presentation about the project.

44
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,018
[SPEAKER_12]: You're muted right now, Jerry.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: There you are.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Sullivan at SSV Architects.

47
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

48
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have Louise with me too.

49
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:01,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

50
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:15,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to hear all about the proposed improvements and the request for funding.

51
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:21,020
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, a little bit more about the daycare that you're trying to open.

52
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,083
[SPEAKER_12]: How many seats will there be in the daycare?

53
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:36,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way the Department of Early Education and Care determines the occupancy is based on the open square footage, and it's typically 35 square feet per child.

54
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:42,925
[SPEAKER_10]: So based on my rough estimation, it could be anywhere from 30 to 50 children in the space.

55
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:43,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

56
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: It always depends how the layout will look, because they calculate open space only.

57
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:55,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does not involve any of the bookshelves or tables that I will put in into the space.

58
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,710
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

59
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you have any sense of what the waiting list is like for early child care in Medford?

60
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:05,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They're huge.

61
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I have over 50 people on my waiting list.

62
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:10,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

63
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:20,494
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the families constantly reach out and I have to turn them away.

64
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:26,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some of the families I'm working with right now, they waited for over a year, some waited for two years.

65
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:37,144
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of the families go the nanny route, but that's just not feasible for families because they have to bring in someone into their home and some homes are just not set up that way.

66
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:42,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a lot more financially as well where they have to pay a private nanny.

67
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:43,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

68
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

69
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Love to get the context.

70
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:46,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

71
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question?

72
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:48,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

73
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you located physically now?

74
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:57,523
[SPEAKER_10]: We're right on Boston Avenue, 28 Boston Ave, which is right next to St.

75
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:06,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Raphael Church and School as well, in West Medford Square.

76
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:10,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm currently licensed as a family child care.

77
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the first floor apartment that I have dedicated to a current space.

78
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's maximum six?

79
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:16,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Ten.

80
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

81
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:24,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, any other questions about the child care committee members online?

82
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:28,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't finished.

83
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to know how many people do you intend

84
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,390
[SPEAKER_03]: move into that commercial space at St.

85
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis?

86
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: How many do you anticipate having?

87
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:54,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So anywhere, well, depending on what the licensing capacity is going to be, but I expect within the year, we will be able to enroll up to full capacity, which would be anywhere from 30 to 50 students.

88
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:54,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

89
00:06:55,575 --> 00:07:01,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And those are the ages, infancy, which is three months old, typically up to five or six.

90
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:16,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a huge gap of children in terms of the age that I'm looking to present in terms of the population that we will address.

91
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:31,119
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that context, I would love to invite Jerry from SSB to talk about the project.

92
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:38,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe give us an update on, because not all of the committee members have been here since this project began.

93
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:51,458
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe give us a little bit of background on where you started with this project, what you've completed so far, and then what this funding phase is looking to do.

94
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:52,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

95
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:59,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like me to share images, or has everybody seen those?

96
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Please share images that would be very helpful.

97
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you co host ability.

98
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can share.

99
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to share now.

100
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, 1 2nd, make sure I get the most.

101
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to date 1 here.

102
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:20,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you faster than me and pulling this up or should I keep pulling it here?

103
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:25,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do have the- No, no, I'm not asking Louis.

104
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

105
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:32,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually better at finding this stuff than I am.

106
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a whole bunch of stuff pulled up, but not the drawing.

107
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second here.

108
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:39,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I will file open.

109
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:41,756
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you do.

110
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:42,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

111
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:44,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go ahead and share then?

112
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:49,318
[SPEAKER_08]: One second, Louis.

113
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could pull up the original images of the church.

114
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,519
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be able to share now.

115
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:08,659
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

116
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can see your screen.

117
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll give you a quick overview and you can get into the details, at least on this.

118
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:35,363
[SPEAKER_01]: The church itself is actually made up of two parts.

119
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:47,507
[SPEAKER_01]: The original church, which is over there on the left portion, I don't have the exact date, but that was the original build and then there was a large addition put on to the end.

120
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:53,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can pull up a photo of this, just for those who haven't seen it, just in the background if you could.

121
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:05,199
[SPEAKER_01]: What we started out doing was looking at a restoration of the windows, which made a lot of sense at the time.

122
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:11,564
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it was determined that a more pressing need was the accessibility of the building.

123
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:28,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at a few options in which to get an elevator inside the building, but realized rather quickly that it was going to be rather expensive and it was going to eat up a lot of critical space that's needed by both the church and now the daycare center.

124
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:45,084
[SPEAKER_01]: What we proposed in lieu of that was a very small addition near the very back of the church, which we think fits in well without being a complete copy of the church, in which we had put an elevator.

125
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:56,010
[SPEAKER_01]: You enter at mid-level between the church and the lower level daycare, and there will be a small Lula elevator that will go up,

126
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:02,675
[SPEAKER_01]: about six feet to the church, and then also about six feet down to the lower level.

127
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: It's followed by stairs that also bring you to these two levels.

128
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it.

129
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,542
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.

130
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:19,711
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives a new entrance, a new feel to the space, but it does not, do you have any elevations there, at least on this, that we can share?

131
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of this file now, not on that 1. okay.

132
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:26,753
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

133
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:33,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what we are proposing there and then on the lower level, which is what you're looking here.

134
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:41,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking to deal with as many different levels and level them off as much as possible to provide.

135
00:11:42,558 --> 00:12:00,584
[SPEAKER_01]: a daycare center which is usable, functional, and safe for the children, adding an accessible toilet room, and then also just a small toilet room for children who will be there.

136
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:03,525
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an extravagant project in any way.

137
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing will be the accessibility to the building, which is off the parking lot.

138
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:19,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And then providing new finishes inside.

139
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:26,252
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also talking about some electrical upgrades and some heating and air conditioning upgrades as well.

140
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:31,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

141
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:33,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have an elevation, Jerry?

142
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,156
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

143
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you pull it up, Louisa?

144
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to take over?

145
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:38,858
[SPEAKER_02]: The access.

146
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Access to see visualize that space going into the building because it doesn't disrupt the building itself.

147
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,034
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, like, a small bump out.

148
00:12:53,765 --> 00:13:15,080
[SPEAKER_02]: for the building so that people coming to the daycare or coming to the church or we have any community meetings, stuff like that, that require people to be able to use an elevator or the stairs so that they can go right to the basement or go up to the upstairs meeting room that's next to the sanctuary, which are connected.

149
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of you who have visited the church see that there's expansion at upstairs when you have a full choir

150
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,942
[SPEAKER_02]: and full activities, such as a funeral or wedding or something like that.

151
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:33,286
[SPEAKER_02]: You expand that space out there so that you can do much with it.

152
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a real community thing.

153
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:41,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That section that he has built out there goes in the back section where the old ramp is.

154
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:44,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And we utilize the old back door.

155
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's captured right up to the building.

156
00:13:47,895 --> 00:14:04,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use what would put a puncture a small hole in the foundation so that the lower and the staircase you can walk right without any hesitation right into the basement area, which has a kitchen and all the service area and the daycare people.

157
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:20,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Frequencing that they kill have ease in doing that, which is, I think, particularly important that for the short money that is proposed, it will really make a real enhancement to the facility.

158
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a community facility.

159
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have three or four things going on at one time just for that little bump up.

160
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:34,418
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the potential tenant, which was sort of helps support the church's service to the community.

161
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:39,089
[SPEAKER_02]: You have people who want to rent space in the building.

162
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a way to use that space up or downstairs.

163
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the regular parishioners.

164
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:48,654
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be able to elevate myself if they ever came.

165
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be able to maneuver that up and downstairs without much ado.

166
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:57,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see how that's laid out.

167
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: The bump out comes on the back portion of the church where the old ramp used to be.

168
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these drawings are slightly older.

169
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually made the addition a little bit narrower.

170
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,280
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come out quite as much.

171
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,081
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to get it in.

172
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the way that you enter at mid-level.

173
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:25,590
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go downstairs to the daycare using stairs or the Lula elevator.

174
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll also bring you up to the church.

175
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:49,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's a shingle style building, so we're bringing a small and for functional reasons to slope group there so that we can fit the elevator in there without making too much noise or trying to be quiet with respect to the rest of the building because the, the building.

176
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much you can see from here.

177
00:15:53,299 --> 00:16:01,604
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful shingle-style building that really has a lot of character to it.

178
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:08,429
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to get into the other phases and redo the windows and the shingles and the whole bit.

179
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:09,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The exterior is in good condition.

180
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,071
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still needs work.

181
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:18,433
[SPEAKER_01]: The area we're talking about the addition is right where you can see that van, if you can see that image right there.

182
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:31,758
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in that back area over there, close to the parking area, close to the accessible parking as well, and the various vans to increase the accessibility.

183
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Question for Doug.

184
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:48,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the bump out consistent with the historic preservation standards?

185
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:50,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

186
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'd want to have it come before the commission just to kick the tires on this thing.

187
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The design looks very good overall.

188
00:16:56,472 --> 00:17:04,317
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obviously very sympathetic to the building, but I think this building has been found significant in order to get some of these grants.

189
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd probably just want to

190
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I think run it by the commission.

191
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:12,701
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a pretty expensive project.

192
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:22,985
[SPEAKER_07]: A Lula is a lot cheaper than a full-blown elevator, so there's money savings there, but obviously with the foundations and the complexity of the digging and all that.

193
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me again, maybe Teresa or someone else, what's the request we're getting here because it's not construction obviously, is it?

194
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:32,909
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

195
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:33,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now,

196
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:42,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking for about $400,000 to finish this phase of the project.

197
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:45,783
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the request tonight.

198
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:52,189
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have to fund it in full with new partial, just to make it clear for the newer members.

199
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that based on a cost estimate you have in hand from a contractor?

200
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:08,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It is based on an estimate that was given to us by CBER construction.

201
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:19,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, with some with some recommendations for saving some money, which we take it, like, for example, the particular type of Lulu that we're using.

202
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:27,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And the like, and and we do find after all it is, you know, the addition is actually less expensive.

203
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:37,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, than trying to put the elevator in the existing building due to the, the nature of the wood structure and the, the fire code requirements and the like.

204
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can see that that would be difficult because we built a Lula in the ship at Brooks Manor.

205
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,278
[SPEAKER_07]: We luckily have the space for it.

206
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,840
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a place internal.

207
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,602
[SPEAKER_07]: We already had accessibility to the building.

208
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:52,262
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't here.

209
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:55,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can see why this design is what it is.

210
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:57,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's well thought out.

211
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:58,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that very clearly.

212
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:03,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kaylee.

213
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:09,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thanks for the presentation as a mom to 4 very young kids.

214
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the need for a daycare center.

215
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:16,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So love the idea of this question for Roberta, maybe your Teresa.

216
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:26,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So my understanding of off cycle application, there's like an immediate need for funding that like a resource or something is going on.

217
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to be available if it's not funded now, and so I'm just wondering if that's true here, or if we should maybe wait.

218
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:36,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our applications due in a couple of weeks, and then we're reviewing the next couple of months.

219
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:44,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't know if it would be better because it's such a big ask to wait for the regular cycle and then go ahead and just one other question, but you can answer that 1st.

220
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:58,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, so our custom is that the committee will vote on whether to accept this as an off cycle application or request that they come back to the regular funding cycle.

221
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,971
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the first vote that we would take this evening.

222
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:12,013
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if we elect to take this as an off cycle application, then we can vote on whether or not to recommend the funding.

223
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:23,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so the criteria for off cycle applications has customarily been that it meets a high priority need.

224
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:33,032
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is driven by a timeline that is beyond the control of the applicant.

225
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:34,273
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not just that.

226
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:44,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot to apply and now I want to apply for this thing or it would be nice to do it now rather than later.

227
00:20:44,696 --> 00:21:04,110
[SPEAKER_12]: A project that is already under construction is often considered to be just by definition an urgent need because if it's already under construction, delays in construction are going to increase the cost for the project.

228
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:15,099
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, more than just because the costs are increasing, but because you may have, you know, you may already have staging and things in place that.

229
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,461
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in this case, I believe construction has not yet started.

230
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,641
[SPEAKER_02]: The de-lidding has been started in the building.

231
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:27,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The drawings, the sketches have been done.

232
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,895
[SPEAKER_02]: What Jerry is doing, he's doing the final construction drawings.

233
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of people who've come through the building and making the assessment.

234
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the final details will be on the construction details.

235
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sort of know where the numbers are.

236
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:59,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be a shame to just push it down the window of construction, because the trustee board is really interested that we have a tenant that's able to do the rental.

237
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would satisfy much of the cost of the church, and it would satisfy the community that needs.

238
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:13,334
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I understand, waiting, what would be until January?

239
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:37,262
[SPEAKER_12]: October, November, December, so awaiting another three to four months would delay your construction by three to four months and the opening of the daycare and potentially change the cost of construction, given that you already have estimates to proceed that this is based on.

240
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:42,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what's at stake here and why they're requesting an off-cycle application.

241
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:45,422
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what the committee should take into consideration.

242
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,225
[SPEAKER_12]: But your second question, Kayleen.

243
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

244
00:22:54,227 --> 00:23:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my second question was, so I saw the proposal from Seaver, the estimate, and I was just wondering if you had reached out to other contractors or gotten other proposals just because it is pretty extensive, just to compare, because your request is pretty large and our pot is only so big.

245
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just wondering if you had gotten other estimates.

246
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:23,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that will happen once we have a little better construction drawings.

247
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,782
[SPEAKER_02]: We're timetable for that, Jerry, isn't that fine down the road as I understand it?

248
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:33,705
[SPEAKER_01]: We're aiming to get the construction drawings done pretty much by the end of this month.

249
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:42,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the decision has to be made whether we're going to send it out to bid or just invite

250
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:47,277
[SPEAKER_01]: the contractor, whether it be Siever or someone else.

251
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's where we stand right now.

252
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Both options still are on the table.

253
00:23:54,897 --> 00:24:00,581
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage of just sticking with the contractor that we've provided the estimate is the speed of doing it.

254
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:03,603
[SPEAKER_01]: The drawback is you lose a little bit of the competition of it.

255
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the trade-off.

256
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:11,429
[SPEAKER_01]: But to the best of my knowledge, Bill, that decision wasn't 100% made at this juncture.

257
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think it is, there still is the opportunity of just going with the contractor so it can get done before the winter, because we don't want to hit in winter conditions on this.

258
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:35,123
[SPEAKER_12]: That's yet another timing consideration for the committee to consider.

259
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:37,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

260
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could jump in here, like Jim on SSV, I deal with

261
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:49,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Contractors all the time, you know, it's not a quick and easy process to rebid a project.

262
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,161
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it will take time.

263
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you save a little bit of dollars, like, you would probably spend.

264
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: at least, they take at least a month, I think, to price some things.

265
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And these days they're all very busy and their schedules are not usually something they have available to people right now.

266
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:20,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, if you're trying to get this done by the winter, I think a negotiated settlement, a negotiated contract with the existing contractor is definitely the most efficient approach to get it done before the winter.

267
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:23,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, there's no chance you're going to make it in my opinion.

268
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:28,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's truly the trade-off, absolutely.

269
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:33,080
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that have been providing the estimate and the comments so far.

270
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,203
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll continue to do that if they're signed up with.

271
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:43,988
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, we happen to go out to bid again and start the process again.

272
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:50,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get more competition, but at the end of the day, you may end up spending more money.

273
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:53,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Still have to talk more.

274
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:59,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So just if you don't mind clarifying for me, I must have missed something.

275
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:05,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've already gone out to bid for a project that has already been proposed, and now you're changing the project scope?

276
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:09,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Or have you done any bidding or procurement yet?

277
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,264
[SPEAKER_01]: No, right.

278
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's incorrect.

279
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:20,670
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did was we brought a contractor on board to provide some estimates and recommendations for cost savings and the like.

280
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:23,252
[SPEAKER_01]: The project has not gone out to bid yet.

281
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:25,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

282
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:32,754
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this money request for the paying of construction documents to be made or is this for construction?

283
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:39,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the funding all set for basically the A&E part of it, the construction documents?

284
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:40,882
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

285
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:42,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

286
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:46,187
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for construction of it based on the estimate that we received.

287
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

288
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:52,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do a lot of procurement and managing construction projects in my day job.

289
00:26:52,275 --> 00:27:01,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, in a perfect world, maybe you'd be getting your construction documents and, you know, shovel ready, but I find it a very aggressive schedule to be

290
00:27:02,903 --> 00:27:04,924
[SPEAKER_05]: to thinking that you're going to get this done before January.

291
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:06,445
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion.

292
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:08,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

293
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,146
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go out to bid, we definitely won't.

294
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:11,927
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about that.

295
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:13,668
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be a spring project.

296
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:25,273
[SPEAKER_01]: The only option for getting it done in the fall would be to engage the contract to get on their schedule, finish up our documents, and proceed.

297
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,174
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only option I see.

298
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think you're absolutely right.

299
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: To go to the traditional design bid build,

300
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,600
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that this would be done before January.

301
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:43,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even though the, the earth is getting warmer, it's still hard to do a foundation in January.

302
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

303
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I jump in here?

304
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:51,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

305
00:27:53,062 --> 00:28:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I need some clarification around this because I'm looking at the map that Teresa has created on our website at the city that says that we've already funded two projects for this site, one being the exterior restoration and study,

306
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: and one being ADA improvements.

307
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:22,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I look at your application and it says total CPA funding request 746,610.

308
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: which I don't see that math on the summary of project costs.

309
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:30,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I see something closer.

310
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And Teresa just said, you're only asking for 400.

311
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very confused about what this task is for, number one.

312
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:46,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And number two, I'm looking for the urgency in terms of going off cycle.

313
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I really am concerned about

314
00:28:50,825 --> 00:29:13,405
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure the CPA process is not, is adhered to and that the reasons that we said we'd accept off-cycle applications was really things that were, you know, outside of your control insofar as, you know, if we didn't do this now, we were going to lose this other money or, you know, something like that.

315
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:13,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that,

316
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to get it done by January, because unless there's, you know, if we don't get it done by January, it doesn't happen.

317
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:22,052
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?

318
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So there has to be a more compelling reason to take it off cycle.

319
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:27,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise.

320
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:32,621
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody's going to submit an off cycle application and then our process is pretty much blown up.

321
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:35,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying to make sure that we adhere to what the.

322
00:29:36,104 --> 00:29:41,667
[SPEAKER_06]: City Council asked us to do, which is they are the approving body for a funding perspective.

323
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:47,550
[SPEAKER_06]: They asked us to stay on a cycle and to present at a certain time of the year, and we're trying to do that.

324
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:50,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to respect their requests.

325
00:29:52,313 --> 00:30:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 1, I don't see where the numbers are and how does what we're asking for tonight play into what you've already been awarded, and then what is the real urgency for getting this done?

326
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:15,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll defer you to the daycare situation, because that becomes a critical element in the off-cycle request.

327
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll let you add on to that.

328
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:28,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first I'd like to ask Teresa to fill us in on the background of the history of Shiloh applying

329
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,067
[SPEAKER_12]: being funded with CPA grants.

330
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:32,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have that?

331
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,149
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of the dollar amounts?

332
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the previous grants that they received.

333
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Previous grants, we did $150,000.

334
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:48,180
[SPEAKER_09]: That was to conduct the building assessment as well as the window repair and assessment.

335
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's $150,000 there.

336
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,441
[SPEAKER_09]: We funded $145,000 for the Lula elevator.

337
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:02,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I can address the question about the budgeting here that 746,000 is the totality of the project.

338
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:06,629
[SPEAKER_09]: They have already essentially received 300,000 and CPA funds.

339
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to go back and address the 1st grant.

340
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,033
[SPEAKER_12]: So the 1st grant was our combination of.

341
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:16,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the architectural assessment and.

342
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:24,192
[SPEAKER_12]: As it was written in the application, the project was named exterior restoration, but it was it was written in the application.

343
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:31,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it said that it was for the highest priority improvements that were identified through the condition assessment.

344
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:38,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the condition assessment was completed, the highest priority improvements were actually identified to be the elevator.

345
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:45,193
[SPEAKER_12]: rather than the windows which were anticipated before going into the project.

346
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:51,056
[SPEAKER_12]: So that initial grant of $150,000 was combined the architect services and the beginning of the improvements.

347
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the second grant for $145,000 was to continue the improvements

348
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:13,841
[SPEAKER_12]: with the hopes that they were just going to need the Lula and not additional costs.

349
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:21,244
[SPEAKER_12]: But now a fuller budget, the project is much more fleshed out now than it was when they came for the $145,000.

350
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:33,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last time they came asking for the $145,000 for the Lula, I can't recall, but Shiloh had actually asked for more funding at that point, but we had trimmed it down to the Lula.

351
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:56,183
[SPEAKER_09]: elements of it if i'm not mistaken i can't remember it was like a 200 and maybe 20 225 sticking into my head at that point so we had actually reduced that previous request to that 145 that's for the future construction of lula or is there already another one that so that was the first estimate of what the lula was going to cost

352
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:04,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Based on that first estimate, they requested 145 last year, but that was before it was fully designed.

353
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:12,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that it's fully designed, the estimated cost is 700,000 rather than 300,000.

354
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:17,586
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why they're asking for the difference today.

355
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Has any of the money been spent yet?

356
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, about 60,000, I think.

357
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:27,463
[SPEAKER_09]: On the architect.

358
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,444
[SPEAKER_09]: On the architect.

359
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:28,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

360
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is great that they are extending.

361
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:34,846
[SPEAKER_10]: And diletting.

362
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:36,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And diletting, yes.

363
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:37,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And diletting.

364
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,468
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a big project, diletting?

365
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:40,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

366
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:41,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

367
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:46,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that they also received a small ARPA grant.

368
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,131
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one.

369
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:49,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

370
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:49,711
[SPEAKER_09]: $40,000, yes.

371
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,472
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one we used for diletting.

372
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:51,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

373
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:55,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was an additional preservation grant, I want to say.

374
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:58,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It says 43,000.

375
00:33:58,435 --> 00:33:59,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

376
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:00,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

377
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:04,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the ARPA grant?

378
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,381
[SPEAKER_12]: ARPA was the 40,000.

379
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so there's an additional grant.

380
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:10,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

381
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:16,990
[SPEAKER_12]: So they've been also looking for additional funding sources besides CPA.

382
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:17,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

383
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think urgency too.

384
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:23,095
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been working together since last August.

385
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:32,146
[SPEAKER_10]: was the hopes that the space will be available and ready for rent for me to come in and start the center last January.

386
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:44,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we keep getting pushed back and pushed back, which is, of course, also a challenge for me in planning what is that space going to be, recruiting, hiring.

387
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:51,477
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many different aspects that play into starting a center aside from renting the physical space.

388
00:34:53,091 --> 00:35:01,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So the space that you're in now, are you renting that month to month or are you signing a lease?

389
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:04,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I own the space.

390
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:07,156
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've grown out of it, is that what you're saying?

391
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, yes.

392
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:16,020
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just because of the need and the wait lists, I just see the potential there.

393
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:30,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to add some more information, at the city level, we're aware that child care after school care is an exponentially growing need here in the city, just to provide that feedback.

394
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:39,364
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody has children in the Medford school system, it's notoriously challenging to get any sort of after school program.

395
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is an urgent need in the city.

396
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:45,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking about that.

397
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:49,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But bonsai is just early childhood, right?

398
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:50,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm open.

399
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:53,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I can be licensed for both.

400
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:56,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm open to considering the after school care as well.

401
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of the proximity to Brooks.

402
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I have my own two children at Brooks.

403
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:06,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the walk, it could be so easily accommodated without transportation.

404
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,102
[SPEAKER_10]: which is so many other spaces challenges the transportation to the afterschool care.

405
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here, it could be just the walking to site.

406
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's less than half a mile.

407
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:22,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, this Cliff Singleton, we've been approached by other folks too about the other space that we have.

408
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:26,729
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just waiting on the construction to be completed by the afterschool program.

409
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:33,012
[SPEAKER_14]: So we got additional potential renters, but they're just waiting on the construction to be completed.

410
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:36,469
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, so that's what they're waiting on.

411
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have no issue with the, you know, the potential use of the space.

412
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:48,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, again, I'll reiterate, I totally understand the need for childcare in the city.

413
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:56,940
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just will echo Jones comments of my pretty big concern, you know, to take this off cycle, and sort of setting a precedent here.

414
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all that's my final comment.

415
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:09,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm in a similar place where I love this project.

416
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:09,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.

417
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,240
[SPEAKER_00]: We deeply, deeply need this childcare and it looks like it's very nicely designed.

418
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:25,685
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, we've put in quite a bit of work over the last few years to create a coherent funding schedule and funding process where we can actually compare

419
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:27,153
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant needs.

420
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:37,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that this is one of the top needs of the city along with affordable housing, so I have no doubt that we would approve at least a substantial portion of it.

421
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:50,731
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'm having a tough time with the combination of off-cycle, the fact that the kind of only pressing emergency is

422
00:37:51,748 --> 00:38:00,317
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunately inevitable realities of construction, which is that everything just keeps getting pushing pushed back and takes forever.

423
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,040
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's only been 1 quote, I.

424
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:13,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a specialist in procurement, so I can't speak to whether it's typical to only have talked to one contractor.

425
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:20,835
[SPEAKER_00]: My other experience is making me a little twitchy on that, as well as the very accelerated timeline.

426
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:28,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking myself into it being something that we should move to the general funding

427
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:36,828
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline, I also want to reiterate that I think this is a spectacular use of CPA money.

428
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just slightly over one side of the fence.

429
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:46,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be convinced otherwise because of the importance, but I do think we need a coherent process.

430
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:50,936
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put in so many guardrails to have this coherent process.

431
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,618
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I end up.

432
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear other people's thoughts.

433
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:10,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, I appreciate the committee members commitment to our application process.

434
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:25,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I do just want to ask the architect what you see as a realistic timeline if you were to receive a commitment of funding

435
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:42,718
[SPEAKER_12]: in October, or by October, I think it would be by, yeah, if you were to receive a commitment of funding, say, the beginning of October, what would be the timeline to have the project completed?

436
00:39:42,738 --> 00:39:52,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And what would be the impact of your having a funding decision completed by, say,

437
00:39:55,554 --> 00:40:04,100
[SPEAKER_12]: December if the committee like that would be the earliest that the committee would be able to make a decision on the regular timeline.

438
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:10,185
[SPEAKER_12]: So what difference does that 3 months make to you?

439
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:27,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my thoughts on that is the is obviously the mobilization of the contractor again, dealing with the winter conditions part, because the 1 of the 1st elements of this is the excavation and the demolition of some of the lower level elements.

440
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:41,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is whether dependent so that that becomes a factor in the, in the consideration here, if we're talking, pushing back the decision on that, then locking in with the contractor gets pushed back.

441
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,932
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, into into the new year.

442
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:52,514
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time they're able to mobilize and and so they were talking about.

443
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:57,336
[SPEAKER_01]: excavation probably not happening till the end of February, early March.

444
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:03,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're talking four months of construction by the time they're fully done.

445
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a huge project, but like all projects, there's an element of each.

446
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,523
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of different trades.

447
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they're not doing a lot, they're all brought in.

448
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:18,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

449
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:32,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Under the best case scenario, if the funding was approved in December, the excavation is taking place in February or March.

450
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:40,312
[SPEAKER_12]: If the funding actually were approved in October, are you ready to mobilize that quickly?

451
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds as though you don't have the construction documents completed.

452
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:50,079
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds as though you may still need to gather information before getting up

453
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:53,354
[SPEAKER_12]: contractor under contract?

454
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:56,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the issue is getting the contractor.

455
00:41:56,455 --> 00:42:00,336
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually fairly well along with the drawings.

456
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:11,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the bigger issue is getting a contractor on board because they're going to have to estimate it or price it.

457
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're brought on board immediately, beginning of October,

458
00:42:18,221 --> 00:42:30,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they can look at it before the drawings are 100% and they can be ready to be mobilized in early November, perhaps, best case scenario.

459
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then potentially go with the excavation part and get it done before the main part of the winter.

460
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:47,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, winter conditions starts to play a real factor in this element.

461
00:42:49,312 --> 00:43:01,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, not a big project, but getting the contractor mobilized so that excavation can start well before December would be necessary.

462
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we're talking about a February start and then four months.

463
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:13,948
[SPEAKER_13]: I just as a layperson to building, I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

464
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:24,970
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the digging that needs to happen before we're deep into December, but the other aspects of building can carry on through the winter.

465
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I getting that right?

466
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:32,672
[SPEAKER_13]: The project just needs to be initiated in November at the latest if we want to get it done.

467
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:36,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they want to beat the frost.

468
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:39,597
[SPEAKER_02]: The frost is an issue when the frost gets in the ground, right?

469
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:42,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I'm just trying to clarify with architect.

470
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:45,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it just that like first stage that needs to get in there?

471
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And how long does that take?

472
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:54,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like hearing you say early November best case scenario, which like my mind is like, OK, well, then what's the range?

473
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:57,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Like what is the realistic range of what we're looking at?

474
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that the best case?

475
00:43:58,968 --> 00:43:59,809
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the worst case?

476
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,470
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the average case like?

477
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:09,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually happening before the winter, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

478
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:20,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think negotiating or signing a contract with the contractor becomes critical because there's a lag from the time they're brought on board.

479
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:30,559
[SPEAKER_01]: To the time when they actually start construction, you can't just expect them to start 2 weeks after you sign a contract with them.

480
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,645
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes the bigger element here, because they're going to have to get geared up.

481
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:39,869
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to make their schedule and start coordinating schedule with the other disciplines.

482
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:47,934
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer your other question more directly, there is a few elements that are weather dependent, such as the roofing.

483
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:52,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Roofing that goes on in January and February is notorious.

484
00:44:53,197 --> 00:44:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bond well.

485
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,802
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, they can work in the winter, through the winter.

486
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:08,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I didn't clarify completely the exact dates because obviously it is weather dependent.

487
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:14,581
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does sound like what you're talking about here that you're talking about a late February start.

488
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:20,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless a commitment can be made on October 1st.

489
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So I also want to be realistic about the

490
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:35,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Another partner to this timeline is the city actually being able to execute a contract with you.

491
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:48,823
[SPEAKER_12]: So what is the lag time that you would estimate between city council approving and actually signing a contract, Cliff signing a contract?

492
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:52,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Three to four weeks.

493
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:56,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like the three weeks I can make happen.

494
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it wouldn't be any earlier than that.

495
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:08,275
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't, there's administrative stuff inside, but yeah, the city council meets on the 15th, just to keep that in sight.

496
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,299
[SPEAKER_12]: That's October 15 October.

497
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:20,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I just want to like, lay out the timeline so that we understand winter versus not winter construction period and what the impact might be.

498
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:30,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So, the, if we were to vote on this tonight, the city council might approve it October 15, which means that.

499
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:41,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Cliff might be signing a contract for a grant agreement in the middle of November.

500
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pause you there.

501
00:46:43,649 --> 00:46:44,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

502
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we were talking about in October.

503
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:52,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we were to vote tonight, it would be heard of the September 24th city council.

504
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:58,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so so that puts us more into signing a contract mid October mid October.

505
00:46:58,924 --> 00:46:59,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

506
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:03,025
[SPEAKER_12]: So grant agreement, potentially mid October.

507
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:14,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And meanwhile, you're working on the construction agreements so that you'd be ready to mobilize most likely by December.

508
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:17,669
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd be ready to mobilize versus if we pushed you off.

509
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:22,873
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be that many months out that you'd be ready to mobilize.

510
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:30,556
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe there would be a cost impact because of moving it out that late.

511
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:43,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So you might, if you were to put in an application in December, it might be for a larger amount of money, perhaps, than the amount that you're asking for now.

512
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,401
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to be realistic.

513
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:59,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Or do you think that it will not impact the price that much to wait?

514
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:03,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices are beginning to stabilize, but they're still continuing to go up.

515
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:06,232
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not going up at the same rate that they used to.

516
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:19,946
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to say on that and how much more it would be to push it back a little bit.

517
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:23,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Time and costs, inflation are only part of it.

518
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:29,910
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part is the availability of contractors to start.

519
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,190
[SPEAKER_01]: People do build through the winter.

520
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to scare everybody in that sense.

521
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,031
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always that possibility.

522
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:38,393
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unknown and that's where it becomes a little difficult.

523
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:54,164
[SPEAKER_12]: And one last timing question that I had for you is the funding that you've already received so far, you have a little bit less than half of what this whole project needs is already committed to Shiloh.

524
00:48:54,805 --> 00:49:04,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So is there any way that the funding in hand could help to advance the project?

525
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:09,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Or do you really need to have the full commitment to be able to advance the project?

526
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:22,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that depends on the confidence of Bill and Cliff in signing before it's fully approved.

527
00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:27,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trustees probably have more conversation about it.

528
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:41,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But because the jurors would like a little bit of guaranteed insurance that we're going to follow through because we don't want to go out and have to borrow money or anything else to finish the project.

529
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:50,902
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like that most of us know that there's a strong need for this thing.

530
00:49:51,702 --> 00:50:05,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can see our way through some of the administrative stuff that always is in the way, would be much appreciated by the church and I think the daycare in the community.

531
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:10,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that happens is that we keep pushing things down the hill.

532
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:13,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an opportunity.

533
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:24,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a wonderful project that just allows for a lot of things to happen and stabilizes that community as it continues to change.

534
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:30,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, West Methodist is changing and it's growing with a lot of youth.

535
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:35,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the old timers are leaving and a lot of new timers are arriving.

536
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an excellent time for us to establish a community

537
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:42,895
[SPEAKER_02]: community effort there.

538
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:48,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would much appreciate your consideration.

539
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:55,606
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to return to committee member discussion about the off-cycle application.

540
00:50:55,626 --> 00:51:05,295
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know whether what we've learned from this additional information, excuse me,

541
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:13,150
[SPEAKER_12]: brings, helps to bring anyone toward clarity.

542
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:19,554
[SPEAKER_10]: And also just final comment too, I think Jerry it's worth pointing out that even to get that

543
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:28,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was not just one contractor involved, but there were six or nine of them that had to be coordinated to come in into the space.

544
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:33,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And it took about six weeks to get all the estimates back.

545
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:38,808
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not one contractor coming in and giving out quotes.

546
00:51:39,168 --> 00:51:45,811
[SPEAKER_10]: It was quite an extensive process that the church went through with SEVA, bringing in each individual contractor.

547
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:56,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So it means if the time pushed back, then they all need to come back, which in itself took quite a while and lots of communication amounts.

548
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:08,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize that this is an important project for the church, for your business, et cetera, et cetera.

549
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:13,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have two elements here that need to be addressed.

550
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,667
[SPEAKER_03]: The first element, obviously, is the

551
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: off-cycle situation, all right?

552
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if you all pay attention to the political scene in Medford, but quite frankly, I think that there's a question on the ballot this year that is going to talk about an override for problems in two and a half, right?

553
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:48,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not exactly sure that the climate is really ready for us to offer an off-cycle presentation to the City Council come September or October.

554
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: just my thoughts, okay?

555
00:52:56,654 --> 00:53:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite frankly, I myself understand that, you know, you might have had a general contractor come in and he had to have some contractors that had to, you know, coordinate their efforts and so on and so forth.

556
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:17,249
[SPEAKER_03]: As we're heading into the winter months,

557
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:26,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Coordinating that effort is going to be even tougher, I believe, for you to do in that short period of time.

558
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:28,898
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already talking about halfway through September.

559
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time we get finished with our determinations, we'll be into the middle of October.

560
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't get the monies until at least December, right?

561
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,150
[SPEAKER_12]: for all of our decisions, or just this one?

562
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,231
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just for all.

563
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:50,252
[SPEAKER_12]: For all of the decisions.

564
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:55,396
[SPEAKER_12]: December is about the earliest that we could start making decisions on the regular funding cycle.

565
00:53:55,576 --> 00:54:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I realize that it's an important thing.

566
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

567
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,922
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand the passion that you all have done.

568
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:12,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But your time is terrible at this particular juncture, from my perspective.

569
00:54:14,128 --> 00:54:18,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my perspective, and that's really all I have to say about the matter, to be honest with you.

570
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing is not good.

571
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I also speak that it looks like this quote is already expired.

572
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:36,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It says that the proposal may be withdrawn within 30 days if not accepted, and it was dated on June 24th.

573
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:41,813
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, if the contractor was going to pull this, they would have already done it, or they could have already done it.

574
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:58,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that in looking for whether or not this met the test on an off-cycle, while it would be nice to get this done before the winter, I don't see that that argument's been made.

575
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:03,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you're going to get kicked out of a leased space, so you must move.

576
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: We love this project.

577
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:08,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We know Medford needs this project.

578
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:11,793
[SPEAKER_06]: But the guardrails are there for a reason.

579
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:26,060
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure that the process as agreed upon by the committee and the city council and is stated in the ordinance that we adhere to it as closely as we can with exceptions that are outlined.

580
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:32,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself had a third floor put on my house in January.

581
00:55:32,217 --> 00:55:33,718
[SPEAKER_06]: They took the roof off my house.

582
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:37,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that work can get done over the winter.

583
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:46,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't see the urgency here, except for you want to get it done and there's a great need, which we know is true.

584
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:50,989
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I sort of echo what Ari was saying.

585
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:56,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure I see the argument here for an off-cycle application.

586
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:05,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to jump in and I realize this risks derailing.

587
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:16,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the 2.5 discussions are going to be super relevant to this.

588
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:22,957
[SPEAKER_00]: This is money that's already been determined and allocated from the community.

589
00:56:22,977 --> 00:56:26,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that it's

590
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:39,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Viewed quite separately from any political ballot measures, it's already dedicated, but I do take your point that that is something that you are concerned about.

591
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:41,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I am, but.

592
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:50,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I think there's a part of me and it seems like other people are agreeing that.

593
00:56:51,613 --> 00:56:54,516
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this timeline seems to be best case scenario.

594
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:57,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start moving into the.

595
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction is rarely best case scenario.

596
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:03,804
[SPEAKER_00]: We start just getting to where the decision would be otherwise.

597
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:12,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also get the benefits of like actually being fair to all the other applicants and creating a coherent funding system that.

598
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:16,861
[SPEAKER_00]: allows for allocation based on the needs of the community.

599
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:25,536
[SPEAKER_00]: think if there were an expiring quote or a rental lease or something like that, I could be swayed pretty easily.

600
00:57:25,556 --> 00:57:32,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not sure I've heard that case and I so deeply hear your frustration and desire to get this done.

601
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:38,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say I really hear that and I deeply empathize.

602
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:44,560
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some construction projects in our house, but that's also part of what's making me

603
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:53,627
[SPEAKER_00]: think that your project also might not go at the warp speed you're hoping it does as much as I wish you all the construction luck in the world.

604
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:59,532
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point, Ari, and I actually concur with my fellow commissioners.

605
00:57:59,612 --> 00:57:59,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

606
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:07,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything always takes longer to do than you think when it deals with products of this complexity.

607
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:14,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's the CDs being completed, whether it's the contractor mobilizing, we could get an early winter.

608
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:17,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to be in winter conditions no matter what we do.

609
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:18,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'd prefer to

610
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:31,488
[SPEAKER_07]: get it, you know, tighten up the CDs, get a bid, you know, a contractor to commit to a schedule, not just the price, because the price is meaningless without a schedule, right?

611
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:36,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it could be, you know, it's not going to mobilize in two, four, six or eight weeks.

612
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:39,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't, your schedule is kind of shot at that point.

613
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:46,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it does represent about 20% of the cost, I think of the, of the budget that we have, plus or minus $2 million.

614
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:50,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Teresa, I think this is what we're looking at for ballpark, right?

615
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:50,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a,

616
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:55,194
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 percent of that for taking off the top, it's tough.

617
00:58:55,714 --> 00:59:00,456
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a lot of competition this year based on the list of products that I saw earlier.

618
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll tell you right now, I'm 100 percent committed to this project on every level.

619
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:05,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a need.

620
00:59:06,598 --> 00:59:08,358
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, this will be a top priority.

621
00:59:08,498 --> 00:59:13,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be a question of, in my opinion, if you get the money, but just how quickly.

622
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:14,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Agreed.

623
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:19,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And you had a chance to weigh in.

624
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't feel like I have anything else to add.

625
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I just feel like the ideas have been captured by the group.

626
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:26,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you.

627
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:27,703
[SPEAKER_12]: And have I missed anyone else?

628
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:31,366
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't see everyone online, so.

629
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:33,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Lane, did you have anything to add?

630
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:38,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, I didn't I didn't know if you needed a motion or.

631
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if maybe.

632
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:52,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to think the best way, because we encounter this exact situation before maybe the best way to document.

633
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:59,933
[SPEAKER_12]: The committee's decision this evening would be a motion to.

634
01:00:01,294 --> 01:00:10,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Just gathering what I'm hearing from everyone this evening, we might be looking for a motion to decline the off cycle application, but.

635
01:00:11,806 --> 01:00:15,127
[SPEAKER_12]: encourage the applicant to apply in the regular cycle?

636
01:00:17,268 --> 01:00:18,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

637
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we just move the application to that cycle or do they have to reapply?

638
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,511
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the application.

639
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:29,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just put it in the regular cycle.

640
01:00:30,212 --> 01:00:35,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I will make the motion for whatever Roberta just said.

641
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:37,375
[SPEAKER_12]: To decline the off-cycle application.

642
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and move it to the regular.

643
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:41,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

644
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:46,092
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I will call the roll.

645
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:47,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting with the people in the room, Ada?

646
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:48,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

647
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:49,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Reg?

648
01:00:49,614 --> 01:00:49,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

649
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:52,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And online, Ari?

650
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:53,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

651
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:55,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Kayleen?

652
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:56,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

653
01:00:57,661 --> 01:00:58,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Joan?

654
01:00:59,122 --> 01:00:59,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

655
01:01:00,183 --> 01:01:00,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Doug?

656
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:01,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

657
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:03,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes for myself.

658
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,650
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you everyone.

659
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:21,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry that we couldn't give you an expedited decision this evening, but we do encourage you to continue finalizing your construction plans.

660
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:34,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have amendments to the amount requested, to your project scope, or to the budget between now and

661
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:39,936
[SPEAKER_12]: October, yeah, or November.

662
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:43,459
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take amendments before we make the final decision.

663
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: They can ask for a different sum, correct?

664
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:50,025
[SPEAKER_12]: They can ask for a different amount, yeah.

665
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:54,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible to ask for a different amount.

666
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:58,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that the architect was talking about the cost might increase.

667
01:01:58,353 --> 01:01:58,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

668
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:05,347
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll work with that, put it into the proposal.

669
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:14,093
[SPEAKER_12]: If you need to obtain new estimates, you know, maybe as Kaylene suggested, get votes from a different contractor.

670
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:28,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to put work in your hands that is not appropriate because you're the experts more than I am, but I welcome you to continue gathering the information that you need to submit a

671
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:50,454
[SPEAKER_12]: successful application um in october all right so the application that is presented will get amended yes for whatever we submit yeah in uh was it november oh it's october october is remind me the application deadline or is that no okay

672
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,968
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sorry, the application deadline is already now.

673
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:55,908
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've already presented.

674
01:02:56,048 --> 01:03:01,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know that we need to ask you to come back and present again when the other applicants present in October.

675
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:08,872
[SPEAKER_12]: But we will be beginning our deliberation in November at our November meeting.

676
01:03:09,192 --> 01:03:12,413
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd say any amendments are needed by November 1.

677
01:03:14,354 --> 01:03:17,995
[SPEAKER_12]: November 1 is a hard deadline for amendments to the application.

678
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:22,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just out of curiosity, how many applications have you received?

679
01:03:22,437 --> 01:03:31,562
[SPEAKER_12]: If you stick around, you'll learn a lot because the next item on the agenda is to review the applications we've received.

680
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for hearing.

681
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

682
01:03:35,704 --> 01:03:37,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, everyone.

683
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:37,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

684
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:38,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

685
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:44,168
[SPEAKER_02]: This time is particularly important for everybody and we appreciate your

686
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:49,811
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting us out and putting us first on the list and so that we can talk about things.

687
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

688
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:56,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I think it's good that you came at this time.

689
01:03:56,814 --> 01:04:05,396
[SPEAKER_12]: We would ask you to give a presentation in October, but this gave us more time to hear the whole story and for you to be able to make the whole case.

690
01:04:05,616 --> 01:04:13,979
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this was good timing to get that presentation from all of you rather than on a crowded night when everyone else

691
01:04:15,357 --> 01:04:18,038
[SPEAKER_12]: all the other applicants are here at the same time.

692
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:19,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's going to happen?

693
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:24,499
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be a meeting with all the other applicants, but we will not ask you to come back and do it again.

694
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:35,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just told at 3.30 today if you can't join tonight.

695
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry if we were ill-prepared.

696
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:40,342
[SPEAKER_10]: You were not.

697
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:43,603
[SPEAKER_10]: We can come with slides and pictures if it's easier.

698
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:44,403
[SPEAKER_10]: We can come back.

699
01:04:45,546 --> 01:04:57,352
[SPEAKER_12]: We look forward to coming to your ribbon-cutting for whatever improvements you're able to make with the funding that the committee already has or will give you in the future.

700
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:58,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

701
01:04:58,193 --> 01:05:01,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we get some rides on that Lula elevator.

702
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:02,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fun.

703
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:03,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you will.

704
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:04,356
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll get the whole one.

705
01:05:04,556 --> 01:05:07,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you so much.

706
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Y'all have a good night.

707
01:05:09,198 --> 01:05:09,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

708
01:05:09,758 --> 01:05:10,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

709
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,720
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to meet you all.

710
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice meeting you.

711
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:16,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

712
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:17,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you.

713
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:18,767
Absolutely.

714
01:05:18,807 --> 01:05:20,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

715
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:21,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

716
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you to everyone.

717
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:43,113
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be nice if we could.

718
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:47,995
[SPEAKER_12]: So to those of you online, you might notice that we're becoming fuzzier and fuzzier.

719
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:53,978
[SPEAKER_12]: That's because we have mood lighting in this room and it's only half lit as the sun goes down.

720
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:54,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this a dinner?

721
01:06:01,393 --> 01:06:05,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Jody, it looked like pre-HD TV on my screen.

722
01:06:05,735 --> 01:06:07,035
[SPEAKER_09]: This is next to the door.

723
01:06:07,095 --> 01:06:09,356
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very nice room, though.

724
01:06:09,376 --> 01:06:11,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Medford, but it's a great meeting room.

725
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it actually is.

726
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:29,493
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, next up on the agenda.

727
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:34,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up on the agenda is a brief review of the upcoming FY25 applications.

728
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:38,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to attempt to share my screen.

729
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:39,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Bear with me.

730
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:44,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got too much going on in my background.

731
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:46,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta do something.

732
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I need an image.

733
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find the raise button.

734
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:55,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a raise my hand button on my screen, so I don't know.

735
01:06:57,742 --> 01:07:00,063
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?

736
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:00,643
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

737
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:06,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to try to drag this over here and hopefully it will still work.

738
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:12,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Doug and Joe, Kathleen, everybody, Ari, can you see the spreadsheet?

739
01:07:13,808 --> 01:07:17,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a very thin line in the middle of my screen.

740
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:18,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

741
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,710
[SPEAKER_06]: You just, you just, there you go.

742
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:19,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

743
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:20,491
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

744
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:21,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, cool.

745
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:21,931
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

746
01:07:24,008 --> 01:07:26,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm getting my mouse back on the side.

747
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've already done kind of an overview.

748
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,874
[SPEAKER_09]: There wasn't anything really terribly new.

749
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:34,076
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of things fell off, though.

750
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:37,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'll do is just kind of run down the list.

751
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:42,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody buzz me if they want to stop and chat about it a little bit more or have questions here.

752
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:47,986
[SPEAKER_12]: We're mostly interested in a list right now because we're going to learn a lot more about the projects over the next couple of months.

753
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:48,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

754
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:52,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me actually make this a little smaller.

755
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:56,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks at home, you can read that okay still?

756
01:07:58,098 --> 01:07:59,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't look like it.

757
01:08:01,779 --> 01:08:03,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Doug.

758
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:07,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Jeez.

759
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:15,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we have received an application for City Hall bathrooms for ADA approved.

760
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:19,802
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

761
01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:22,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hear all of a sudden.

762
01:08:22,983 --> 01:08:23,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hear him either.

763
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:29,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, DPW, you're frozen.

764
01:08:31,268 --> 01:08:31,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

765
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:35,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't handle that lighting level.

766
01:08:36,169 --> 01:08:36,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

767
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:42,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy, can you hear us?

768
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:47,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

769
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:51,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I just texted a chat to her saying you're frozen.

770
01:08:56,386 --> 01:09:02,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear you.

771
01:09:02,549 --> 01:09:03,109
[SPEAKER_06]: There they go.

772
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

773
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:09,833
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

774
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:13,355
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened there?

775
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:15,216
[SPEAKER_06]: They dropped off.

776
01:09:15,796 --> 01:09:17,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the mood lighting, I think.

777
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it off and turn it back on again.

778
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:20,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

779
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

780
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:23,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have a quorum here.

781
01:09:23,268 --> 01:09:23,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good.

782
01:09:23,928 --> 01:09:25,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We're no longer being recorded.

783
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:27,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Kaylee, for speaking up.

784
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always good for that.

785
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, they're back.

786
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,894
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can't hear you.

787
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:38,794
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted.

788
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,215
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted.

789
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:43,032
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

790
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:44,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear us now?

791
01:09:45,054 --> 01:09:46,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can.

792
01:09:46,775 --> 01:09:47,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

793
01:09:47,596 --> 01:09:48,337
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

794
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me re-share my screen.

795
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:51,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Try that again.

796
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It still looks like that.

797
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Excel, she had to crash the meeting.

798
01:09:56,183 --> 01:10:00,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

799
01:10:01,087 --> 01:10:01,408
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

800
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:11,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if you heard, but they've opted to make the ADA accessibility upgrades to all the bathrooms and come through and address

801
01:10:12,563 --> 01:10:18,809
[SPEAKER_09]: other things.

802
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:26,876
[SPEAKER_09]: They are coming to CPA for the ADA improvements as this first phase 1 of the bathrooms at City Hall.

803
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:35,944
[SPEAKER_09]: They intend to do a phase 2 where it's the rest of the items, HVAC, fixtures, what have you, that aren't related to ADA accessibility.

804
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:45,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm actually, as I'm talking about this out loud, does that mean all the other upgrades are not going to be funded by CPA since we can only fund accessibility?

805
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is it a historic building?

806
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:55,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we can find what's needed to make the building so code improvements.

807
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:06,449
[SPEAKER_12]: We can find the reason why is part of what we can find is because we can find the work that's necessary to make a building functional for its intended use.

808
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,992
[SPEAKER_12]: So is City Hall functional without bathrooms?

809
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:25,281
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not up to code, then I think CPA can bring a historic building up to code.

810
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:35,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is something to consider as we're looking at phase one here as well as phase two is, okay, they're telling us that there will be future updates

811
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: What do those look like?

812
01:11:38,446 --> 01:11:38,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

813
01:11:39,446 --> 01:11:49,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so just again, because I'm new to this, historical preservation, is it the designated historical building or is that something we would be kind of budgeting a little bit?

814
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:50,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's a good question.

815
01:11:50,612 --> 01:12:01,858
[SPEAKER_12]: City Hall, if it doesn't, so maybe it already has some kind of a historical designation, we would know that if it's on the state registry.

816
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:05,280
[SPEAKER_12]: The state registry is basically

817
01:12:07,481 --> 01:12:11,883
[SPEAKER_12]: identifies buildings that have some kind of historical designation.

818
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:20,587
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if the City Hall is already on the state registry, then it is automatically eligible as a historic building.

819
01:12:20,948 --> 01:12:34,915
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not, then we do need to ask the Historical Commission to put it on their agenda to determine whether they think City Hall is a historic building.

820
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:42,078
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is kind of my line of thinking a little bit with this one, which is that I'm involved in the override campaign.

821
01:12:42,098 --> 01:12:46,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's obviously the talk about the rainy day fund and like, why can't we just use free cash?

822
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:54,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the counter argument is like free cash is for capital investments, not operating funds.

823
01:12:54,263 --> 01:13:00,806
[SPEAKER_13]: It's for need, like one time need to improve city resources.

824
01:13:01,266 --> 01:13:02,826
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the rainy day fund is for.

825
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:04,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm looking at like,

826
01:13:04,888 --> 01:13:13,560
[SPEAKER_13]: bathrooms for the city hall and I'm like it's a little bit it feels like a little bit of like a mission creep for like community improvement whereas it feels like to me like

827
01:13:14,082 --> 01:13:18,004
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you would want the rainy day to be used for.

828
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:22,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just going to put that out there because, like, again, I'm new to this, but that's where my head went with this.

829
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:27,749
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is, I think, like, the other part of our conversation tonight.

830
01:13:27,789 --> 01:13:31,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And we just want to, because there are a lot of things to talk about, so we don't want to go into the weeds.

831
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:37,114
[SPEAKER_12]: But any conversation like this, Teresa, you can be listening to this, and you can take that feedback.

832
01:13:38,773 --> 01:13:45,896
[SPEAKER_12]: back to the applicant to say, this is what the committee might be thinking about when they are considering our application.

833
01:13:45,936 --> 01:13:47,177
[SPEAKER_12]: So you might want to address that.

834
01:13:47,197 --> 01:13:50,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Be prepared to address it in their presentation.

835
01:13:50,898 --> 01:13:53,880
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's both fair questions.

836
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me jump in here real quick on the city hall.

837
01:14:00,597 --> 01:14:02,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on the National Register of Historic Places.

838
01:14:02,718 --> 01:14:04,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's on the state register.

839
01:14:04,298 --> 01:14:07,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should bring it before the commission.

840
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:15,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an architect, Dyer, who's got a lot of buildings in the city of Medford, who's very well-known.

841
01:14:15,302 --> 01:14:23,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that plus the building itself would probably qualify if I had to give you a spot check at this moment.

842
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:26,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I recommend we just go down that route to check that box.

843
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:32,000
[SPEAKER_07]: the next meeting.

844
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:35,346
[SPEAKER_07]: We just met last night, so let's get on the October agenda.

845
01:14:42,323 --> 01:15:07,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm also so a reason for speaking with Ryan Hayward is another thing to consider about this and any other city owned historic properties is that last in the last couple of years, we've funded a number of CPA grants for city on historic properties, and we don't have any way of protecting those properties to make sure that we protect the historic investments that we make.

846
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:14,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working to try to get the city to do something to protect them.

847
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:20,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Put it under a local historic commission would be the easiest way to accomplish that.

848
01:15:21,338 --> 01:15:23,699
[SPEAKER_12]: So that conversation is also happening in the background.

849
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:35,367
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't done it yet, and I really am pushing to at least make some progress on that before we recommend more funding for more city-owned historic buildings.

850
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:40,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll have a resolution about that probably within the next 60 days.

851
01:15:41,131 --> 01:15:46,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be in time for us to make our funding decision.

852
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:47,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

853
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:54,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I brought up the hose tower restoration study at Engine 3, which is on Salem Street.

854
01:15:55,019 --> 01:15:58,821
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not pursuing that at this time, perhaps next year.

855
01:16:00,794 --> 01:16:13,545
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be seeing, and we already have received, obviously, an application from the Affordable Housing Trust for their, we don't wanna say seed money, but their startup funding initial tranche.

856
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:18,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a really nice, compelling application from the Affordable Housing Trust.

857
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:26,977
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two applications there for identical projects owned by the same, it's the Queen of Mary, I think it's the,

858
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:29,753
[SPEAKER_09]: that owns St.

859
01:16:29,773 --> 01:16:30,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Joseph's and St.

860
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:31,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis.

861
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:42,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Identical projects where it would be very similar to what was done at Shiloh in terms of a window restoration study as well as funding.

862
01:16:42,358 --> 01:16:43,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is Cindy Watson?

863
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is she?

864
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,920
[SPEAKER_09]: She is a member of the board.

865
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,681
[SPEAKER_09]: She is

866
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:56,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know her exact title, but she's an administrative assistant.

867
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,152
[SPEAKER_09]: For both churches?

868
01:17:00,573 --> 01:17:08,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Both churches are owned by the local diocese, and I want to say it's the Queen of Mary Diocese, so they have same ownership.

869
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:11,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned that too.

870
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:15,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not know.

871
01:17:15,481 --> 01:17:16,822
[SPEAKER_09]: That's who Cindy Watson is.

872
01:17:17,302 --> 01:17:18,303
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a firecracker lover.

873
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:22,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost complete.

874
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:27,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I received most of the application for the Curtis Tufts High School conditions assessment.

875
01:17:28,179 --> 01:17:32,642
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about this, I believe, at our last meeting, which we pulled up pictures of the cupola that's there.

876
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:35,844
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be seeing that for 150.

877
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Received a car park phase two tranche.

878
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:49,875
[SPEAKER_09]: This is essentially to finish out some of the recreation projects there, mostly the skate park.

879
01:17:50,537 --> 01:17:52,618
[SPEAKER_09]: is kind of what the funding is intended for.

880
01:17:54,659 --> 01:18:04,202
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not be pursuing an invasive plant removal project this year due to bandwidth, but the Office of Planning eagerly supports it for next year.

881
01:18:05,943 --> 01:18:11,525
[SPEAKER_09]: We received an application from the Unitarian Universalist Church for building restoration.

882
01:18:11,545 --> 01:18:17,967
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a lot of stonework that needs some addressing as well as some shingle work.

883
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:20,499
[SPEAKER_09]: What where, which church, which one?

884
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:24,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Unitarian Universalist, where we had the CPA party.

885
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:30,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, next to the next to the Woody Hullen house.

886
01:18:30,826 --> 01:18:31,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

887
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:31,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

888
01:18:32,027 --> 01:18:34,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

889
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:44,195
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I have an actual, I'm going to sidebar with Roberta about this, but let's get to that.

890
01:18:44,976 --> 01:18:46,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Oak Grove Cemetery master plan.

891
01:18:46,877 --> 01:18:48,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got another plan for that one.

892
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,079
[SPEAKER_09]: As well, oh, and I skipped over this one.

893
01:18:53,099 --> 01:19:01,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Barry Park test court resurfacing was deprioritized over, where is it, Playstead.

894
01:19:01,926 --> 01:19:03,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I not get Playstead on here?

895
01:19:03,548 --> 01:19:05,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Playstead's on there.

896
01:19:05,389 --> 01:19:13,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the administration thinking about, not making us make the decision about what's the most important project to fund this year.

897
01:19:14,056 --> 01:19:14,496
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was,

898
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:20,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, did you say Oak Grove cemetery master plan that you have crossed off is back on?

899
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:23,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, that one, why does it keep doing that?

900
01:19:23,738 --> 01:19:25,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

901
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:33,464
[SPEAKER_09]: The Oak Grove, I'm gonna, it's not gonna be a CPA application, it's still a project that's going forward, but not CPA.

902
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:42,490
[SPEAKER_09]: ABCD, as well as housing families, additional tranches for the ongoing assistance programs that we offer.

903
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:45,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, we have Shiloh Baptist here,

904
01:19:47,985 --> 01:19:49,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Riverside Plaza shade improvements.

905
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:54,830
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to update if they're asking for 400,000, you want to update that in our total here?

906
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

907
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:02,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Riverside Plaza shade improvements.

908
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:08,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about this one last time and seem to be eager to see this application come through.

909
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:09,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing's changed there.

910
01:20:11,533 --> 01:20:20,579
[SPEAKER_06]: We had this really nice couple of thing that used to be there, where you used to wait for the bus.

911
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:25,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when it was up there, I said to then city councilor, who was it?

912
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:26,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Marks.

913
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:28,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, what are you going to do with that thing?

914
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:30,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a piece of history.

915
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:30,866
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, do you want it?

916
01:20:31,467 --> 01:20:32,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no.

917
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to go pay for a shade thing.

918
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:36,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Shoot.

919
01:20:36,991 --> 01:20:39,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Not out of Princeton, is it?

920
01:20:41,289 --> 01:20:47,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that the improvements, the renderings I've seen for this will make it a more functional recreational space.

921
01:20:48,054 --> 01:20:50,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just, let's throw some shades up there.

922
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:58,883
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about repurposing with new seating, creating protection of that tree that butts up right against the Salem Street Barring Ground.

923
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very thoughtful.

924
01:21:01,586 --> 01:21:01,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

925
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:03,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it is.

926
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:11,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Hegner building restoration, this will be for roof as well as doors and windows.

927
01:21:12,262 --> 01:21:15,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Can they get money from Washington for that, an earmark?

928
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:17,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they did get $850,000.

929
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:24,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are they spending that on?

930
01:21:24,854 --> 01:21:29,979
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing the mechanicals with that as well as some interior build out that's required.

931
01:21:31,317 --> 01:21:35,260
[SPEAKER_09]: CPA can't fund interior work at that capacity like that.

932
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a historical asset, but it's being repurposed.

933
01:21:43,705 --> 01:21:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Frowny face from Dunkar, I don't know about that.

934
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Which building is the Hegner building?

935
01:21:50,129 --> 01:21:54,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's technically called the Randall Fieldhouse.

936
01:21:54,791 --> 01:22:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Metro Police Department parking lot is what it is behind Gillis Park.

937
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:02,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

938
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:08,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So hasn't that been vacant for a number of decades?

939
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:12,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because as to John's point, it was used as a police training center.

940
01:22:13,118 --> 01:22:15,321
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't been actively used for many years.

941
01:22:16,202 --> 01:22:16,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

942
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:18,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is why it needs work.

943
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:23,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a plan for it to be used afterwards?

944
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:29,439
[SPEAKER_13]: It's written in the federal grant we got through the appropriation process.

945
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:37,427
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a press release that the mayor's office put out of what they're planning to do in the Hagner Center, but it includes an after school and a shelter.

946
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:38,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Recreation.

947
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:42,432
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be basically our community emergency shelter.

948
01:22:44,783 --> 01:22:47,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and all that stuff.

949
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:48,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

950
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:50,691
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as be used for after school and recreation.

951
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:56,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think we need both like, there's an unlimited need for answering those.

952
01:22:56,578 --> 01:22:56,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm fine.

953
01:22:56,959 --> 01:22:57,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably.

954
01:22:57,379 --> 01:22:57,499
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

955
01:22:57,559 --> 01:23:01,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, I think it's about like, 1.8.

956
01:23:01,945 --> 01:23:02,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no.

957
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:07,280
[SPEAKER_09]: writing sourcing additional funding for that, but they didn't want to ask us for 1.8.

958
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,922
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just for 300, which was appreciate that.

959
01:23:10,022 --> 01:23:14,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm really comfortable since like the building is going to need totally repurposing on the inside.

960
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:17,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate CPA just focusing on the exterior.

961
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:25,536
[SPEAKER_12]: But to the earlier point, has the Hagner building already been identified as a historic building?

962
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:29,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an email chain about this from when I was trying to let me pull that up.

963
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:30,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

964
01:23:31,915 --> 01:23:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a local letter from the Medford Historical Commission saying that they find it historically significant.

965
01:23:38,898 --> 01:23:44,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of it, a Form B was done, but it's not on any state or federal.

966
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,841
[SPEAKER_09]: And a Form B is basically just a report.

967
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:55,264
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have any... As of December last year when I was emailing with them, it was not designated.

968
01:23:55,284 --> 01:23:57,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks for checking on that.

969
01:23:57,284 --> 01:23:58,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Doug, did you have something?

970
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:02,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw you unmute yourself, so I thought you might have a comment.

971
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:03,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

972
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:03,532
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

973
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:03,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

974
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:05,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

975
01:24:06,434 --> 01:24:07,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I just updated this.

976
01:24:07,494 --> 01:24:07,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 50.

977
01:24:07,974 --> 01:24:13,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I got word at like 412 today that it's going to be closer to 85,000.

978
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:15,598
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for Condon Shell field lights.

979
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:27,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It would provide really nice, better lighting for the stage so that we can extend the Condon Shell's use as well as put in walkway lighting from the parking area.

980
01:24:28,599 --> 01:24:31,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure the farmers market would really appreciate and love that.

981
01:24:32,664 --> 01:24:44,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say if there's one project that's likely to get controversy, by the time it gets through city council, that's one that I could see people talking about.

982
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:46,533
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a lovely idea.

983
01:24:46,553 --> 01:25:02,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Lighting is going to extend the hours of use, and people who live in the vicinity of that listen to very loud music as often as there are concerts at the Condon Shell.

984
01:25:02,665 --> 01:25:06,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I can hear them all the way to my house near Whole Foods.

985
01:25:07,087 --> 01:25:09,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I love live music.

986
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:10,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to complain.

987
01:25:10,608 --> 01:25:11,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's great.

988
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:22,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to manage expectations and think that that is one that actually might get people coming to speak against it at city council meeting.

989
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:31,215
[SPEAKER_12]: We might want to think ahead about if this committee supports that project,

990
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:47,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, do we need to think about conditions or any discussion, or do we just want to pretend that that's not going to happen and hope that it won't do we want to ask Kevin Bailey to articulate what the.

991
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:50,160
[SPEAKER_13]: actually use is going to be?

992
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, maybe.

993
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:57,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Extended life because we're going to have approximately x number more concerts in the summer and do like x number of things.

994
01:25:58,007 --> 01:26:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I can pretty much tell you what he's probably going to try to tell you is that he's going to get the lights that only shine straight down.

995
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:08,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't give off any outlying

996
01:26:09,517 --> 01:26:12,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what they call them.

997
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouzo lights or something like that.

998
01:26:17,503 --> 01:26:27,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lighting of itself is not supposed to bother the surrounding areas, theoretically.

999
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:31,813
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using them now on a lot of athletic fields.

1000
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:41,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's like 1 thing, because we did have protests about a, an early application about lighting for an athletic field.

1001
01:26:42,223 --> 01:26:47,826
[SPEAKER_12]: and the neighbors all brought pitchforks about that because they didn't like to see lights.

1002
01:26:48,306 --> 01:26:57,971
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's not that many neighbors here, but the people along West Street and South Street actually are impacted by whatever goes on at the Condon Shelf.

1003
01:26:58,372 --> 01:27:04,615
[SPEAKER_12]: But as somebody who walks through that area, sometimes in the dark, it is very dark, that whole park.

1004
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:09,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So for pedestrian safety, making a lighted walkway

1005
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:15,270
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a great improvement, let alone for the use of the shell.

1006
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:20,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin can say what the hours of operation of the shell are.

1007
01:27:20,894 --> 01:27:21,934
[SPEAKER_12]: DCR leases.

1008
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:22,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1009
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:27,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, we're having two conversations, both of which are very easy.

1010
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:31,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So DCR, I just remember that came up with Georgiana Chevre's proposal.

1011
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:34,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, is it going to run into anything with that too?

1012
01:27:34,543 --> 01:27:34,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1013
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:43,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonah, I think to short circuit the potential negative reaction,

1014
01:27:44,908 --> 01:27:47,390
[SPEAKER_07]: is really just a condition about acoustics.

1015
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:54,774
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can hear a concert at Con and Shell and you live almost a mile away, that's controllable.

1016
01:27:54,794 --> 01:27:58,957
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to project that much sound for people who are 100 feet in front of this Con and Shell.

1017
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:09,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a solution there that I think is pretty obvious that controlling the sound and light is doable for whatever we end up funding.

1018
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:10,605
[SPEAKER_03]: But are we the ones?

1019
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we would be the ones to tell them that they could only have certain decibel levels, right?

1020
01:28:18,297 --> 01:28:21,778
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could get a professional opinion on that.

1021
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:23,659
[SPEAKER_12]: We can recommend that they think about it.

1022
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's like, that's our role.

1023
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:32,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we want them to be successful, but we're not going to put, we're not going to put like actual.

1024
01:28:34,082 --> 01:28:37,503
[SPEAKER_09]: But the recreation department could pursue that if they wanted to.

1025
01:28:37,844 --> 01:28:37,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It's.

1026
01:28:40,117 --> 01:28:43,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we could probably even find other guidelines from other communities.

1027
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:44,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1028
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

1029
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:49,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe they want to think about those guidelines before they put the application in front of city council.

1030
01:28:49,683 --> 01:28:49,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1031
01:28:49,903 --> 01:29:01,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Because maybe they want to demonstrate that they're going to put guardrails around the project that will protect people and be prepared with that.

1032
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:02,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1033
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:07,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Either with a timeline plan or hours after something like that.

1034
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:08,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1035
01:29:09,325 --> 01:29:10,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Great conversation there, thanks, folks.

1036
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:16,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Playstead digital scoreboard, electrical upgrade.

1037
01:29:16,871 --> 01:29:22,475
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still waiting on some final quotes on that one, but if anything, we think this might be a little high.

1038
01:29:22,836 --> 01:29:23,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be closer to 40,000.

1039
01:29:23,676 --> 01:29:27,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is coming through.

1040
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:32,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Oak Grove building restoration phase two.

1041
01:29:32,704 --> 01:29:34,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Really want to talk about that with this group.

1042
01:29:35,358 --> 01:29:38,661
[SPEAKER_09]: For those who are unfamiliar, Oak Grove has two buildings on it.

1043
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:45,907
[SPEAKER_09]: One is the caretakers and the office, and one is the maintenance building, which is actively used for cemetery usage.

1044
01:29:47,748 --> 01:29:51,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The CPA has funded a building assessment for each of them.

1045
01:29:52,612 --> 01:29:59,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, we funded construction documents for the tune of $200,000 to get construction documents on both buildings.

1046
01:30:00,078 --> 01:30:02,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're coming and asking for construction funding.

1047
01:30:04,287 --> 01:30:13,233
[SPEAKER_09]: knowing that I'm not, it's not hyperbole when I say this is an $8 million project between those two buildings, a lot of historic preservation, that's not cheap.

1048
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:28,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So this 228 that we're looking at here, essentially Tim McGivern said, for the first initial phase of construction on the caretaker's building was the 228.

1049
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,326
[SPEAKER_09]: For the maintenance building, it's 180.

1050
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:51,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's obviously going to ask for us to fund both, but he did recognize that that's a lot of money to be asking given our budget, given the situation, and asked us if we would have a preference of which project to fund through CPA.

1051
01:30:52,116 --> 01:30:54,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody's living in the caretaker's quarter.

1052
01:30:54,878 --> 01:30:55,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that what we said before?

1053
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:57,659
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

1054
01:30:57,699 --> 01:31:01,842
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an official caretaker that lives in there as well as uses it as an office building.

1055
01:31:03,254 --> 01:31:03,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1056
01:31:03,514 --> 01:31:06,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have said that that was the priority.

1057
01:31:06,156 --> 01:31:07,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1058
01:31:07,336 --> 01:31:17,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my, my, my question or my thought about the priority would be based on the, what is the level of risk of delaying either of those?

1059
01:31:17,501 --> 01:31:19,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the garage going to fall down?

1060
01:31:19,442 --> 01:31:21,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the house going to burn down?

1061
01:31:21,903 --> 01:31:27,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, which of those scenarios is more likely to happen if they have to wait another year?

1062
01:31:27,386 --> 01:31:29,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll bring that question back to them.

1063
01:31:29,767 --> 01:31:30,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for that.

1064
01:31:32,452 --> 01:31:40,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my own observation, like the maintenance shed is in rough condition.

1065
01:31:40,457 --> 01:31:44,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So either way the projects are getting done is whether CPA is going to fund them or not.

1066
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:44,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1067
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:50,402
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to lose the maintenance shed because we waited a year.

1068
01:31:50,862 --> 01:31:53,964
[SPEAKER_12]: But to Joan's point, I also don't want to force someone to live in.

1069
01:31:54,024 --> 01:31:54,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1070
01:32:00,407 --> 01:32:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, who wants to live in a day of cemetery?

1071
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: The leaking roof and everything.

1072
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Quiet neighbors.

1073
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's true.

1074
01:32:09,971 --> 01:32:13,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to listen to this kind of shell music, right?

1075
01:32:13,933 --> 01:32:16,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Except the coyotes, they get loud.

1076
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:19,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they get coyotes and miscreants.

1077
01:32:20,456 --> 01:32:23,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So all right, thank you.

1078
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:28,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I will take that question back to the commissioner and the applicant.

1079
01:32:30,293 --> 01:32:32,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I need to cross that one off.

1080
01:32:32,554 --> 01:32:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Disregard the community center creation one.

1081
01:32:36,556 --> 01:32:39,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Duggar Park fitness area never came to fruition.

1082
01:32:40,538 --> 01:32:42,699
[SPEAKER_09]: West Medford was deemed ineligible.

1083
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,321
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for the Mississippi playgrounds study for 150,000.

1084
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard back on this application.

1085
01:32:57,579 --> 01:33:00,921
[SPEAKER_09]: More to come on that, but as the application deadline has come and passed.

1086
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:02,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Rich.

1087
01:33:03,322 --> 01:33:05,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go back to number 25 again?

1088
01:33:07,904 --> 01:33:09,705
[SPEAKER_09]: The Duggar Park fitness area?

1089
01:33:09,825 --> 01:33:10,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1090
01:33:10,225 --> 01:33:11,786
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a request.

1091
01:33:12,566 --> 01:33:17,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So we engaged, and it's actually, I'll tout Roberta on this one.

1092
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:17,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Roberta's idea.

1093
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:18,209
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

1094
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:24,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Engaged with the community liaisons that we have that go out and speak, that represent and support

1095
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,551
[SPEAKER_09]: are non-English speaking communities here in Medford.

1096
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:32,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this recommendation actually came from one of the liaisons.

1097
01:33:33,255 --> 01:33:42,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I have brought that to the planning department saying, hey, there's been a request for there to be, essentially it's like the adult fitness areas that you're starting to see pop up.

1098
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,081
[SPEAKER_09]: We've CPA funded one at Gillis, there's one up at Flynn Rink.

1099
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:46,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the intention here.

1100
01:33:48,843 --> 01:33:53,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't presented in time enough to actually pursue it as a project, put the application together.

1101
01:33:54,265 --> 01:33:56,727
[SPEAKER_09]: has been brought to the planning departments.

1102
01:33:57,067 --> 01:33:58,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's Jennifer Alvarez?

1103
01:33:58,608 --> 01:34:00,290
[SPEAKER_09]: She is one of the liaisons.

1104
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:02,131
[SPEAKER_09]: She's one of the liaisons?

1105
01:34:02,151 --> 01:34:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: She's one of the liaisons that works for the city.

1106
01:34:04,233 --> 01:34:04,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1107
01:34:05,494 --> 01:34:11,618
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, you already talked, went through this earlier in the list, but the Curtis Tufts School is on the list, right?

1108
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:11,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1109
01:34:12,379 --> 01:34:12,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, great.

1110
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Just keeping that one.

1111
01:34:17,523 --> 01:34:23,187
[SPEAKER_12]: So that last Missituck School playground might be off the list this year.

1112
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:24,464
[SPEAKER_12]: for this year, okay.

1113
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:25,584
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still a good project.

1114
01:34:25,765 --> 01:34:30,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't we cross that off too just so that we can see, do you have the total here?

1115
01:34:30,127 --> 01:34:31,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

1116
01:34:31,128 --> 01:34:32,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hold this column?

1117
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:37,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, I don't trust myself right now.

1118
01:34:38,593 --> 01:34:41,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, 2.8.

1119
01:34:41,555 --> 01:34:41,515
2.8.

1120
01:34:42,536 --> 01:34:45,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're one million over requested.

1121
01:34:45,178 --> 01:34:49,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about seven, we have one, 2.09.

1122
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,622
[SPEAKER_09]: We can round that up to 2.1 if we want.

1123
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:53,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been.

1124
01:34:54,617 --> 01:34:57,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're about almost 800,000 over budget right now.

1125
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:06,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, just so that is also something that we can feedback that we can send back to the applicants.

1126
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:13,862
[SPEAKER_12]: When they're giving the presentations that we're going to have to sharpen our pencils this time pretty hard.

1127
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:18,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I skipped I mentioned this 1 earlier, but we didn't like, I didn't call it out.

1128
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:23,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That a lot of that 2.8 is coming from this $500,000 request.

1129
01:35:24,087 --> 01:35:25,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, Shiloh as well is $400,000.

1130
01:35:26,628 --> 01:35:33,789
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one project for the playstead tennis courts represents 25% of our budget.

1131
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:35,090
Yeah.

1132
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:37,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to get done.

1133
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:39,351
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I understand that.

1134
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:40,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

1135
01:35:43,672 --> 01:35:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have, you know, we quote permits.

1136
01:35:50,421 --> 01:36:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that the permit for a place that is utilized by an outside vendor who is in collaboration with the city USTA, they use that particular part for their lessons and so on and so forth.

1137
01:36:13,558 --> 01:36:17,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the back of my mind, I'm saying to myself, you know, $500,000 for that one

1138
01:36:21,004 --> 01:36:25,406
[SPEAKER_03]: project is, uh, makes me pause.

1139
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:27,427
[SPEAKER_09]: You can increase your permit fees, right?

1140
01:36:28,608 --> 01:36:29,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

1141
01:36:29,388 --> 01:36:29,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1142
01:36:30,169 --> 01:36:31,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It is three full courts.

1143
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:35,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, in the past when we've funded tennis courts, it's usually been one or two.

1144
01:36:35,932 --> 01:36:41,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So this, I think the place that is our largest, if I'm not mistaken, I can be wrong.

1145
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:47,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't remember how much Tunga cost.

1146
01:36:49,121 --> 01:36:51,922
[SPEAKER_03]: but it probably wasn't funded through CPA funding.

1147
01:36:52,122 --> 01:36:56,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it was, it was done prior to cost escalations and everything like that.

1148
01:36:56,785 --> 01:36:57,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It was CPA funded.

1149
01:36:57,965 --> 01:36:58,285
[SPEAKER_09]: All of it?

1150
01:36:58,525 --> 01:37:00,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all of Duggar Park tennis courts.

1151
01:37:01,087 --> 01:37:01,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1152
01:37:01,827 --> 01:37:02,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It was?

1153
01:37:02,367 --> 01:37:02,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1154
01:37:02,908 --> 01:37:05,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have an idea what the number was?

1155
01:37:05,789 --> 01:37:07,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember, but maybe Joan does.

1156
01:37:09,511 --> 01:37:14,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Duggar, you know what I do, I usually go to the Preserve Medford page.

1157
01:37:14,393 --> 01:37:14,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1158
01:37:14,693 --> 01:37:15,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say,

1159
01:37:19,036 --> 01:37:36,664
[SPEAKER_03]: like 300 sticking you may have like 275 or 300 that did predate me but i was just thinking because they've done the cost with whatever it did what happened i mean has prices gone up that much yeah ridiculous yeah over that did they go out to bid

1160
01:37:41,364 --> 01:37:46,448
[SPEAKER_09]: They will once this project is awarded, they've collected three estimates for the sake of the application.

1161
01:37:46,468 --> 01:37:51,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And that does have a contingency built into it as well.

1162
01:37:52,073 --> 01:38:04,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting during the era of COVID, prices were escalating so quickly that not a single construction project was completed without having to come back and ask for more money since COVID.

1163
01:38:04,724 --> 01:38:06,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Before COVID, it wasn't quite like that.

1164
01:38:07,185 --> 01:38:08,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So we paid for Park Bench for 3,000.

1165
01:38:08,905 --> 01:38:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that.

1166
01:38:09,205 --> 01:38:09,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here we go.

1167
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Park Bench is 3,000.

1168
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:13,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Tennis courts, 293.

1169
01:38:17,207 --> 01:38:18,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And lacrosse bounce back wall, 9,000.

1170
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:38,511
[SPEAKER_08]: $300,000.

1171
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:38,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's for four courts at dark?

1172
01:38:38,852 --> 01:38:39,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.

1173
01:38:42,013 --> 01:38:43,234
[SPEAKER_09]: That's quite the escalation.

1174
01:38:44,074 --> 01:38:46,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more than an escalation, that's how I would run it.

1175
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:46,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1176
01:38:49,516 --> 01:38:57,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that being on the public sector side of things, the whole concept of procurements and prevailing wages, it just blows my mind.

1177
01:38:58,481 --> 01:39:01,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely hope that we can increase our

1178
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:07,616
[SPEAKER_11]: increase our fees for using a facility that we have to put that much money into.

1179
01:39:07,636 --> 01:39:11,781
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're expecting.

1180
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:13,983
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy for me to say, yeah?

1181
01:39:14,023 --> 01:39:15,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to one of our meetings.

1182
01:39:15,785 --> 01:39:17,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite the show.

1183
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:31,954
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so that was all of that was that all of that agenda item so administrative fund discussion I yeah.

1184
01:39:33,696 --> 01:39:39,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this just to introduce the concept of it for again for everybody's sake and refreshers and for new folks.

1185
01:39:40,452 --> 01:39:44,774
[SPEAKER_09]: 5% of our CPA budget is allocated to administrative costs.

1186
01:39:44,794 --> 01:39:58,121
[SPEAKER_09]: This pays for me to operate and manage and support the program, as well as our consultant fees, any invoices, any costs that are incurred in the sake of conducting CPA business.

1187
01:39:59,162 --> 01:40:03,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've put together just a very, very basic spreadsheet.

1188
01:40:05,145 --> 01:40:09,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go ahead and bring it over here.

1189
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:13,368
[SPEAKER_09]: and share it from here because that makes my life a lot easier.

1190
01:40:15,608 --> 01:40:20,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody should be seeing the most basic of spreadsheets.

1191
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:25,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So right there at the top, that is what we had allocated for our CPA budget for this fiscal year.

1192
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:29,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in month three of that fiscal year.

1193
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:30,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So $103,446.

1194
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:38,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Year to date, again, paying me as well as some of our annual costs that we have, like our consultants and

1195
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:41,471
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, office supplies and whatnot.

1196
01:40:41,531 --> 01:40:43,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We've spent $20,000 of that.

1197
01:40:44,513 --> 01:40:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I anticipate, based again on my salary and everything else, that we'll have a further $66,487.

1198
01:40:51,276 --> 01:40:53,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So that leaves us with around $16,800 left in our admin budget.

1199
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:14,476
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a budget that I've been managing, but we haven't really had a group discussion about what is the best way to utilize the remaining funds in the admin budget.

1200
01:41:14,516 --> 01:41:22,280
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, whatever is not spent from this budget at the end of the year rolls into our program funds.

1201
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:23,621
[SPEAKER_12]: So it doesn't go away.

1202
01:41:23,641 --> 01:41:24,521
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't go away.

1203
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:30,164
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's only available the current year for administration.

1204
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:33,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And after that, it becomes program area budget.

1205
01:41:34,827 --> 01:41:45,933
[SPEAKER_12]: So not spending that 16,000 that might be left over at the end of the year means 16,000 more that we can spend on elevators next year.

1206
01:41:47,654 --> 01:41:52,637
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I wanted to run by the

1207
01:41:53,684 --> 01:42:00,929
[SPEAKER_12]: The committee was just on principle, you know, questions come up all the time.

1208
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, can we pay for this side of CPA admin?

1209
01:42:03,871 --> 01:42:08,815
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I wanted to because CPA admin does not have to go through city council.

1210
01:42:09,455 --> 01:42:17,581
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't even technically have to go through the committee, like, Teresa doesn't come asking for permission to pay more legal.

1211
01:42:17,601 --> 01:42:18,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1212
01:42:18,662 --> 01:42:24,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but we do want to think about, like.

1213
01:42:24,046 --> 01:42:29,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Would historic preservation plan or a, an, um.

1214
01:42:35,737 --> 01:42:42,482
[SPEAKER_12]: An open space needs analysis or something like that helps the committee.

1215
01:42:42,502 --> 01:42:46,705
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea is that this budget is meant to help the committee do its business.

1216
01:42:47,486 --> 01:42:51,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So do we want to have a policy about.

1217
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:59,032
[SPEAKER_12]: A threshold of types of projects that the committee wants to make a decision about spending that money.

1218
01:42:59,852 --> 01:43:04,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Or an amount of money that we can spend without the committee having to make a dislike.

1219
01:43:05,257 --> 01:43:07,899
[SPEAKER_12]: But, like, at what point should the committee.

1220
01:43:07,919 --> 01:43:17,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Decide how to spend administrative funds, or does the committee just delegate to Teresa PDF staff.

1221
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:23,252
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe Joan and myself as the chair and co-chair to make decisions.

1222
01:43:25,974 --> 01:43:27,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just ask another question?

1223
01:43:27,376 --> 01:43:27,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1224
01:43:27,676 --> 01:43:30,298
[SPEAKER_13]: What is your process for getting raises and stuff?

1225
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that baked into the salary?

1226
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:39,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, because how our budget is structured, it's 5%.

1227
01:43:41,687 --> 01:43:46,591
[SPEAKER_09]: My raises are dictated by mayor and city council vote.

1228
01:43:48,073 --> 01:43:49,474
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not usually timely.

1229
01:43:50,215 --> 01:43:51,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to complain about that.

1230
01:43:51,696 --> 01:43:53,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just giving facts about this.

1231
01:43:53,998 --> 01:43:57,281
[SPEAKER_09]: We're undergoing a cost of living adjustment right now that is 1%.

1232
01:43:58,262 --> 01:44:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not significant enough to really mess up these numbers.

1233
01:44:05,008 --> 01:44:08,191
[SPEAKER_09]: But they could certainly try to factor that in.

1234
01:44:11,512 --> 01:44:20,354
[SPEAKER_03]: If you correct me if I'm wrong, what you're saying is we can either leave it as is and allow Theresa to do as she's fit.

1235
01:44:20,994 --> 01:44:27,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think up until now, we haven't brought decisions about administrative fund to the whole committee.

1236
01:44:27,876 --> 01:44:30,837
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, the consultants $4,200, what consultants have we?

1237
01:44:30,877 --> 01:44:31,757
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the coalition.

1238
01:44:36,267 --> 01:44:38,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so actually we should put that in there.

1239
01:44:38,047 --> 01:44:40,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not consultants, the coalition.

1240
01:44:40,168 --> 01:44:41,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Coalition fee, yeah.

1241
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:43,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Coalition fee.

1242
01:44:44,188 --> 01:44:54,270
[SPEAKER_12]: An example of consultant that we might pay is the person who prepares the historic preservation restriction or the LHD.

1243
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,971
[SPEAKER_12]: So you would like to see that separated out as two different?

1244
01:44:57,151 --> 01:44:58,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
01:44:59,051 --> 01:45:04,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the past we have retained somebody to draft

1246
01:45:06,002 --> 01:45:16,991
[SPEAKER_12]: preservation restrictions for short money, but without coming to the committee to ask for your endorsement of that plan.

1247
01:45:17,632 --> 01:45:25,598
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's, I'm not sure, you know, like, what is the threshold that the committee wants to make decisions?

1248
01:45:26,439 --> 01:45:28,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because again, money, it's a

1249
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:33,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Use it or lose it for administrative needs.

1250
01:45:33,604 --> 01:45:34,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't go away.

1251
01:45:34,604 --> 01:45:35,124
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have it.

1252
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:38,526
[SPEAKER_09]: We can use it for future year's funding.

1253
01:45:38,846 --> 01:45:46,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So the fact that we have $16,000 here, is this something that we should be planning to use it for something?

1254
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:47,791
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we not use last year?

1255
01:45:47,831 --> 01:45:49,151
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't use about $6,000 last year.

1256
01:45:49,171 --> 01:45:49,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So that went to the general fund.

1257
01:45:49,992 --> 01:45:50,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1258
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:00,311
[SPEAKER_06]: But why is there so much more this year?

1259
01:46:01,992 --> 01:46:03,072
[SPEAKER_06]: What did we do last year?

1260
01:46:03,152 --> 01:46:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do we have the party?

1261
01:46:04,953 --> 01:46:08,395
[SPEAKER_09]: The party and preservation restrictions, probably.

1262
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:09,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1263
01:46:09,835 --> 01:46:15,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to a full-time part-time for a portion of the previous year.

1264
01:46:15,938 --> 01:46:16,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1265
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:18,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

1266
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:22,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So what about our CPA plan?

1267
01:46:22,605 --> 01:46:41,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that every year, you know, Teresa and Roberta take on the yeoman's task of sort of doing the updating and a bunch of us have read it, but is it time to have a professional take a look at that again and maybe, you know, review it?

1268
01:46:42,038 --> 01:46:45,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that way it sort of takes it off your plate.

1269
01:46:47,289 --> 01:46:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: and we have the funds for it, and we've never had a professional do it except for the first time, right?

1270
01:46:54,192 --> 01:46:54,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we?

1271
01:46:54,412 --> 01:46:55,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a professional.

1272
01:46:56,633 --> 01:46:58,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

1273
01:46:58,454 --> 01:46:59,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me back that up.

1274
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a professional.

1275
01:47:01,316 --> 01:47:02,336
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1276
01:47:02,716 --> 01:47:04,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe it's something you like to do.

1277
01:47:04,577 --> 01:47:10,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just put it out there that if it's something you're trying to offload, we can offload it, okay?

1278
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,602
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't, she might- I know, Reg, believe me.

1279
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:18,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God I'm here and not in the room, she'd smack me.

1280
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:25,767
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't have any plans to rewrite that again.

1281
01:47:25,787 --> 01:47:30,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought that it was a professional job that was done the first time.

1282
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, but I also know that you do a lot more than that and you're trying to take something off your plate.

1283
01:47:38,072 --> 01:47:45,818
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I, so I don't know that we need another, like, full plan written.

1284
01:47:45,838 --> 01:47:54,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I would want to make sure that that, like, things that so some, some requests that have come up that could potentially be of use to us or to the.

1285
01:47:57,785 --> 01:48:13,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Or to others in the city in particularly is an assessment of all the playgrounds for accessibility or to prioritize a study to prioritize which athletic fields to improve in what order.

1286
01:48:14,985 --> 01:48:22,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so things like that get to a little bit more deeper level than what kind of like the sidewalk assessment, right?

1287
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:23,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1288
01:48:23,572 --> 01:48:23,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1289
01:48:24,012 --> 01:48:29,417
[SPEAKER_12]: So something on that level might be useful to us if the city wanted to do it.

1290
01:48:29,517 --> 01:48:37,623
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, like, at what point should we come and ask the

1291
01:48:38,462 --> 01:48:54,254
[SPEAKER_12]: committee's permission, like for which maybe like anything in the consultant category actually maybe is a, I'm looking for a threshold of what makes sense to, it doesn't make sense to ask you for permission to purchase office supplies.

1292
01:48:54,274 --> 01:48:58,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Should it be associated with perhaps with a dollar amount, like anything over $2,000?

1293
01:48:59,579 --> 01:49:04,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd courtesy bring it to the committee and just be like, hey, this is a thing that we need to do.

1294
01:49:04,723 --> 01:49:07,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what does the coalition offer?

1295
01:49:08,317 --> 01:49:12,860
[SPEAKER_09]: They are essentially our subject matter experts on CPA.

1296
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:25,209
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't provide technically legal assistance, but they interpret the law for us a little bit in terms of interpreting the CPA ordinance, the state law, and how it would apply to certain situations.

1297
01:49:25,329 --> 01:49:33,535
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a lot of advocacy, can't say that word lately, at the state level to improve CPA legislation,

1298
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:36,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a lot for us.

1299
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's your that's that's your is that your highest expense that you besides pay me?

1300
01:49:41,812 --> 01:49:41,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1301
01:49:42,212 --> 01:49:42,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1302
01:49:42,432 --> 01:49:42,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1303
01:49:42,652 --> 01:49:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: For administrative.

1304
01:49:43,372 --> 01:49:43,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1305
01:49:43,932 --> 01:49:48,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering if there's anything that would cost a lot more than that $4,200.

1306
01:49:50,943 --> 01:50:05,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, within a year, I mean, over the not in one single project that like, um, utilization study for parks and playgrounds could potentially cost more than that.

1307
01:50:06,112 --> 01:50:06,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, like.

1308
01:50:07,933 --> 01:50:10,975
[SPEAKER_12]: 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, I don't know what the number is.

1309
01:50:11,015 --> 01:50:17,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And they might also find money from other sources to contribute to it so that they would only take part of it from CPA.

1310
01:50:17,799 --> 01:50:21,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Using that as an example, just to understand, and I'm sorry, Doug, just one quick thing.

1311
01:50:22,622 --> 01:50:33,769
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were to find that we wanted, as a city, wanted to do a playground assessment or something like that, and it's $20,000, they could come to CPA and say, hey, would you be willing to put in 5,000?

1312
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:35,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll find sources for the other 15.

1313
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:37,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be something that would help

1314
01:50:38,084 --> 01:50:42,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, educate us as we're evaluating applications.

1315
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:42,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1316
01:50:48,523 --> 01:51:00,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's worth putting guardrails on this, because you could obviously update us monthly about what potential uses might be coming down the pike that we could either react to or not to.

1317
01:51:00,831 --> 01:51:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, the administrative office supplies, that's at your discretion.

1318
01:51:06,054 --> 01:51:08,895
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no need for anyone to vote on any of that.

1319
01:51:09,956 --> 01:51:12,077
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do like the idea of Roberta's

1320
01:51:13,678 --> 01:51:21,823
[SPEAKER_07]: building some infrastructure information for the city that help us all move the ball forward on whatever the needs are.

1321
01:51:21,983 --> 01:51:36,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You have some ideas, Roberta, but I think if we would dig back into it, if there's more flexibility in that 16K to spend on things that couldn't be used otherwise, the things that we think we need as a city, I like the idea of using that.

1322
01:51:37,771 --> 01:51:48,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also have thought like what if we decided that the mayor didn't give our friend Teresa enough of a raise, we want to throw her a $1,000 bonus at the end of the year for a job well done.

1323
01:51:48,477 --> 01:51:54,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we pull it from this funding source or is that going to create a civil war at City Hall?

1324
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:59,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be very kind and I love the idea of it.

1325
01:51:59,182 --> 01:52:02,364
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think City Hall would just implode.

1326
01:52:02,384 --> 01:52:04,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we can't have that.

1327
01:52:04,705 --> 01:52:04,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1328
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:13,481
[SPEAKER_09]: But I appreciate, yeah, I mean, it's not a whole heck of a lot of money, but it is still money that is CPA money.

1329
01:52:13,581 --> 01:52:19,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end of the day, we're all here to make sure it gets spent according as we want to see it.

1330
01:52:19,985 --> 01:52:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1331
01:52:20,265 --> 01:52:32,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm of the opinion that, you know, you and your predecessors have always maintained this little, for lack of a better term, slush fund, if you will, you know, for expenses and so on and so forth.

1332
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm of the opinion that I don't think it needs to change.

1333
01:52:38,322 --> 01:52:56,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you wanted to put a dollar amount on the amount that she, Teresa would have to come to us to say, you know, uh, maybe, uh, I don't know, 5,000, if, if, if it exceeded $5,000, she comes to us and says, I'd like to spend $5,000 on such and such.

1334
01:52:56,752 --> 01:52:58,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, we okay.

1335
01:52:58,814 --> 01:53:00,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the end of it.

1336
01:53:00,675 --> 01:53:01,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know,

1337
01:53:02,147 --> 01:53:03,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the money is going anywhere.

1338
01:53:04,169 --> 01:53:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The money is either going to stay there or it's going to go back into the, so it's not.

1339
01:53:09,592 --> 01:53:10,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1340
01:53:10,393 --> 01:53:18,358
[SPEAKER_09]: The good thing is, is this sticks to Roberta's earlier point, we can do a bit more with this without all the administrative red tape.

1341
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:25,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that we would be irresponsible with it, but this is money that could fund those little side projects.

1342
01:53:25,998 --> 01:53:35,143
[SPEAKER_12]: I love having some guy guardrail because when the mayor approaches us and says, hey, could you pitch in $5,000 for this study?

1343
01:53:35,983 --> 01:53:39,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to be able to say, oh, I have to go ask the committee.

1344
01:53:39,926 --> 01:53:41,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1345
01:53:41,867 --> 01:53:42,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

1346
01:53:42,947 --> 01:53:43,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

1347
01:53:43,688 --> 01:53:45,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1348
01:53:45,289 --> 01:53:45,008
$5,000.

1349
01:53:45,309 --> 01:53:45,569
[SPEAKER_09]: $5,000 works?

1350
01:53:45,629 --> 01:53:45,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1351
01:53:46,229 --> 01:53:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have too many, like you said, I don't really have too many bills that come in at that level.

1352
01:53:50,651 --> 01:53:54,894
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would think that if we're talking about something like that, I would need to be talking with the committee anywho.

1353
01:53:55,678 --> 01:54:00,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like the $5,000 if that works for Joan.

1354
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:01,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I make a motion?

1355
01:54:03,922 --> 01:54:04,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1356
01:54:04,142 --> 01:54:04,462
[SPEAKER_03]: May I?

1357
01:54:04,722 --> 01:54:04,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1358
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:19,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'd like to make a motion that we vote to approve anything, any expenses that come in over $5,000 under the administrative budget to be approved by the committee.

1359
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:21,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1360
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,622
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, then I will call the roll.

1361
01:54:27,482 --> 01:54:29,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Want to stop the share so I can see everyone?

1362
01:54:30,423 --> 01:54:30,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1363
01:54:30,744 --> 01:54:31,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me make this easier.

1364
01:54:32,004 --> 01:54:35,346
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

1365
01:54:35,966 --> 01:54:36,286
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1366
01:54:36,406 --> 01:54:40,488
[SPEAKER_12]: So starting with the folks online this time.

1367
01:54:40,508 --> 01:54:40,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Doug?

1368
01:54:41,989 --> 01:54:42,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1369
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:43,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Joan?

1370
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:44,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1371
01:54:45,911 --> 01:54:46,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Ari?

1372
01:54:46,892 --> 01:54:47,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1373
01:54:49,695 --> 01:54:50,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys are moving around now.

1374
01:54:50,936 --> 01:54:51,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Kayleen.

1375
01:54:51,837 --> 01:54:53,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Kayleen, it's a yes.

1376
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:54,860
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1377
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Reg?

1378
01:54:56,081 --> 01:54:56,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1379
01:54:57,902 --> 01:54:58,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Myself, yes.

1380
01:54:59,184 --> 01:55:00,645
[SPEAKER_12]: And I stepped out of the room.

1381
01:55:05,736 --> 01:55:07,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still fighting.

1382
01:55:07,336 --> 01:55:09,937
[SPEAKER_03]: This is high time, man.

1383
01:55:09,977 --> 01:55:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1384
01:55:12,738 --> 01:55:13,478
[SPEAKER_09]: They came up with it.

1385
01:55:13,558 --> 01:55:16,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you still on your feet or something?

1386
01:55:16,299 --> 01:55:17,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Come to the committee for approval.

1387
01:55:17,999 --> 01:55:20,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you would love to vote.

1388
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:21,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys.

1389
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,860
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all good.

1390
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,600
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

1391
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:23,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1392
01:55:24,241 --> 01:55:26,061
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1393
01:55:26,081 --> 01:55:26,601
[SPEAKER_11]: So six, seven.

1394
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're seven.

1395
01:55:28,382 --> 01:55:28,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven.

1396
01:55:28,742 --> 01:55:29,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1397
01:55:29,502 --> 01:55:34,063
[SPEAKER_11]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1398
01:55:36,188 --> 01:55:40,531
[SPEAKER_12]: The last thing on the agenda is minutes from the July 9th meeting.

1399
01:55:41,151 --> 01:55:44,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I move the receipt of the July 9th minutes from 2024.

1400
01:55:44,754 --> 01:55:45,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1401
01:55:46,835 --> 01:55:47,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1402
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:49,917
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1403
01:55:51,378 --> 01:55:52,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard Ari say it.

1404
01:55:53,139 --> 01:55:53,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Ari.

1405
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:54,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1406
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:55,361
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1407
01:55:55,401 --> 01:55:57,002
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Ada.

1408
01:55:57,742 --> 01:55:57,942
Yes.

1409
01:55:58,863 --> 01:55:59,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Reg.

1410
01:56:00,084 --> 01:56:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1411
01:56:00,864 --> 01:56:01,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Doug.

1412
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1413
01:56:05,033 --> 01:56:07,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1414
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:11,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1415
01:56:13,897 --> 01:56:14,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself, yes.

1416
01:56:14,757 --> 01:56:15,477
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1417
01:56:15,537 --> 01:56:16,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, everyone.

1418
01:56:17,058 --> 01:56:18,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other business?

1419
01:56:20,259 --> 01:56:26,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an appointment at 9 o'clock to be in front of my TV, so I moved to close the meeting.

1420
01:56:28,635 --> 01:56:31,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I do have a tiny other business.

1421
01:56:32,597 --> 01:56:46,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Theresa, you'll send out a calendar of upcoming tabling events because Theresa and or myself, whoever's going to be at those events could really use some help if anybody can keep us company.

1422
01:56:47,324 --> 01:56:48,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'll send out some dates.

1423
01:56:49,005 --> 01:56:53,807
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a couple events coming up in back end of September, early October.

1424
01:56:53,827 --> 01:56:55,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to October 1st?

1425
01:56:56,008 --> 01:56:57,149
[SPEAKER_09]: That's October 5th, yes.

1426
01:56:59,014 --> 01:57:00,075
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's like the mission.

1427
01:57:00,095 --> 01:57:05,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm on October fest, but we might need help really tough community day.

1428
01:57:05,761 --> 01:57:06,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be there.

1429
01:57:06,262 --> 01:57:11,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, as well as harvest your energy festival, October 19th.

1430
01:57:11,668 --> 01:57:12,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1431
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:14,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so bad.

1432
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:16,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I never make any of those events.

1433
01:57:16,132 --> 01:57:16,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1434
01:57:16,593 --> 01:57:17,314
[SPEAKER_09]: You're there in spirit.

1435
01:57:17,334 --> 01:57:18,515
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1436
01:57:19,132 --> 01:57:20,352
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll send out a calendar.

1437
01:57:20,572 --> 01:57:22,053
[SPEAKER_12]: I will send one to send out a calendar.

1438
01:57:22,073 --> 01:57:23,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for reminding me.

1439
01:57:23,133 --> 01:57:25,694
[SPEAKER_12]: With that, I think, any Doug?

1440
01:57:25,794 --> 01:57:27,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one other thing that I can't remember.

1441
01:57:27,514 --> 01:57:32,436
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something that came up at the historic commission last night that I need to share with this group, but I just cannot remember what it is.

1442
01:57:32,476 --> 01:57:33,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll email it to the group.

1443
01:57:34,136 --> 01:57:37,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have something to do with the Thomas Brooks Park, but I'll let everyone know.

1444
01:57:37,497 --> 01:57:37,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

1445
01:57:39,457 --> 01:57:48,640
[SPEAKER_09]: On October 22nd, which it happens to be the same day as the CPC meeting, there will be a Thomas Brooks Park update

1446
01:57:49,423 --> 01:57:51,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke with Ryan today about that one.

1447
01:57:52,385 --> 01:57:56,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the same date as the second half of our applicant presentation, so.

1448
01:57:57,568 --> 01:57:58,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we move ours?

1449
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:00,530
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1450
01:58:02,351 --> 01:58:04,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean ours by like the Thomas Brooks Park meeting?

1451
01:58:04,632 --> 01:58:07,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I would agree with that, yes.

1452
01:58:07,714 --> 01:58:11,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, not this meeting, but the historic commission meeting.

1453
01:58:11,816 --> 01:58:16,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did say it to Ryan, but he seemed to want to move forward, but we can take that one.

1454
01:58:18,672 --> 01:58:19,272
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's it.

1455
01:58:19,332 --> 01:58:19,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1456
01:58:21,453 --> 01:58:23,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a motion to adjourn.

1457
01:58:23,234 --> 01:58:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I make my motion to close the meeting?

1458
01:58:25,996 --> 01:58:30,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
