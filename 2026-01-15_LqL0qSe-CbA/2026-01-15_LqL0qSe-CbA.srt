00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:12,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, John.

12
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.

13
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.

14
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:21,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

15
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,748
[SPEAKER_01]: No, go ahead, you can go.

16
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:36,328
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just wanted to say, you know, it's great that we can, um, that you invited me on and we can let the citizens know what the liquor license commission does for the city and, um, you know, give them some information.

17
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:46,253
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody needs to reach out or wants to come to any of our meetings and stuff, I'm sure we're going to go over that and tell you, you know, the procedure and stuff.

18
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, Bobby.

19
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,623
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it's going to be a great show.

20
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:52,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it, okay?

21
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:53,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

22
00:01:54,084 --> 00:02:01,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, let's start out by having you, you know, share with our audience just a little bit about yourself.

23
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is Robert D'Alefano?

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,946
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

25
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:16,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Robert D'Alefano, my friends call me Bobby, born and raised in Medford on Windsor Road, South Medford.

26
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:18,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended the St.

27
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:26,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe's and the Medford Public Schools, graduated Medford Vocational High School in automotive.

28
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:37,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been married to my lovely wife, Cheryl, for 50 years, and have two daughters, Marie and Kristen, and one granddaughter, Gianna.

29
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Employment-wise, I did some auto mechanic work for a while.

30
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:48,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a truck driver.

31
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:53,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a liquor salesman for Charles Gilman and Son.

32
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,616
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be right there in Medford.

33
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,619
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a wholesale liquor distributorship.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to call on package stores, restaurants, bars, things like that.

35
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:13,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for about five years until I was offered a firefighter position for the city of Medford in 1984.

36
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:22,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the honor and privilege to serve the citizens of Medford for 36 years until I retired in 2020.

37
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:32,909
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I, my wife Cheryl and I started a small family confectionery business in Medford Square called Sweeties back in 1990.

38
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:36,210
[SPEAKER_00]: We had that for several years.

39
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,393
[SPEAKER_00]: wound up selling it.

40
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:40,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a little too big to handle for us.

41
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:46,515
[SPEAKER_00]: With my job on the fire department and stuff, I couldn't put the time into it that we needed.

42
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:56,777
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am still an intermittent federal employee serving on a disaster team since 2004.

43
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:12,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a volunteer in time, even when I was a firefighter with the city of Medford, border health, back in the days of Karen Rose, when she was the border health director, used to help out with the flu clinics there.

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:24,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, since COVID, we're doing the flu and COVID clinics now, and I volunteer with the border health there, helping the nurses.

45
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,370
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some,

46
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,075
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them homebound vaccinations, seniors that can't get out, we go right to the house and vaccinate them.

47
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:42,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the past several years, I've helped decorate the veterans graves.

48
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:48,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I place some flags on Memorial Day at Oak Grove Cemetery, and I do that with my family members.

49
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing that the past few years.

50
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:55,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it for me.

51
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:56,468
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.

52
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:57,569
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an awful lot.

53
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,309
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of great stuff.

54
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you care about the city, obviously.

55
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a lot of good things.

56
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to hear.

57
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:12,233
[SPEAKER_01]: So now back to what you're doing now, which is the license commission.

58
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for everything you've done.

59
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:20,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's quite a resume, you know, for the city of Medford, that's for sure.

60
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figured I'd like to give a little back only because I've gotten so much from the fire department.

61
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great job, really enjoyed it.

62
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:31,618
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.

63
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:37,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I saw this thing in the local newspaper.

64
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,285
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were looking for people to be on boards of commissions.

65
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:41,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

66
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:47,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read over it and said, jeez, look, I didn't know what it meant by license commission.

67
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:48,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, a license commission.

68
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a liquor salesman.

69
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of the Chapter 138 laws and stuff might be a good fit, you know?

70
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:55,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

71
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:56,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

72
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:57,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Which it was.

73
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're on the, you're the commissioner.

74
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that happens.

75
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,700
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So let, you know, we'll sort of start and try and go in some kind of order.

77
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:21,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question would be, you know, when does the commission meet and how many members are on the commission?

78
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:23,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

79
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:24,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the commission meets,

80
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:30,675
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly the third Wednesday of every month at 1 p.m.

81
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:52,182
[SPEAKER_00]: at City Hall and we have an open public meeting there so and besides our regular Ottawa business that we have an agenda for every month the public the licensees anybody's welcome to come and attend and ask questions or you know just to find out what we do what we're about

82
00:06:53,868 --> 00:07:02,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Beside myself, there's Alan Maturana, who's a fellow commissioner, as well as Ben O'Sullivan Pierce.

83
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:08,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have Daria Tahara, which is our secretary.

84
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's the glue that holds it all together.

85
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, when we're

86
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:26,344
[SPEAKER_00]: putting together a license or if there's any issues or anything, Derry is the go-to person, and she's the one that can take care of pretty much everything.

87
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:31,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the four of us, we bring a lot of skills to the table.

88
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:40,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had mentioned, I was in the liquor field there for a while, even though it was 40 years ago.

89
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,556
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't changed much.

90
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

91
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:53,199
[SPEAKER_00]: In Alan, he was the vice president of one of the banks here in the city and he's recently retired.

92
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,942
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on the commission for a while as well as Ben O'Sullivan Pierce.

93
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just back up to Alan just a bit where he's had so much

94
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,874
[SPEAKER_00]: so much, let's say, finance, business, things like that.

95
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:18,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what he did at the bank, but I know it was something to do with finance.

96
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:23,641
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps because we have to look at that when people are applying for licenses.

97
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, he's got a construction business.

98
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:29,404
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a builder.

99
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,086
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

100
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:34,888
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to read blueprints or review anything like that.

101
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daria is just an administrative wizard.

102
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,012
[SPEAKER_00]: She's fantastic.

103
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:45,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's at a place that they all do very well.

104
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:51,334
[SPEAKER_00]: And matter of fact, I informed them that I was coming on the show here.

105
00:08:52,174 --> 00:09:01,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had asked them if they'd like any input for me to mention anything that was on their mind.

106
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them basically what I could and couldn't talk about.

107
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:05,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

108
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:10,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have maybe like a paragraph from each of them if you'd like me to read it.

109
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's do it.

110
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

111
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:20,315
[SPEAKER_00]: From Ben, he said, make sure you tell the folks that we're an ally of the licensees.

112
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:28,970
[SPEAKER_00]: and welcome everyone to come to our meetings and engage with us and let us know if they have any questions.

113
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:44,803
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pro-business and want to see our community have good establishments to purchase and consume alcohol, but we are raising the bar so that we attract more quality businesses.

114
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was very good.

115
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alan's been on for a while.

116
00:09:53,643 --> 00:10:04,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan, he said, I would add to the conversation how many liquor licenses are available and how the city encourages businesses to help make Medford a destination.

117
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:12,077
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, one of the proudest examples, in my opinion, is the Great American Beer Hall ownership.

118
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:16,741
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have picked any community to build and they chose Medford.

119
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, it's a testament to the

120
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:26,145
[SPEAKER_00]: willingness to make large projects a success and plenty of room for others.

121
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:36,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was pretty good, you know, that they felt like that and wanted, you know, some input here.

122
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:39,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, like I said, it's a great commission.

123
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody works together and there's no problems at all.

124
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:44,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know, Bobby.

125
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:49,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, the Great Beer Hall, that was a big project.

126
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:59,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta be honest, I, you know, I went to the, I think they call it what, the Italian, the Kiwanis.

127
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,101
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a lot for the city.

128
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.

129
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:03,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.

130
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:08,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you just noticed, I just read something that they're doing like the indoor farmer's market now.

131
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:11,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they're going to do the farmer's market in the winter.

132
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're adding a lot to the city.

133
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:14,406
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.

134
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a huge place.

135
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:16,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

136
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:21,810
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a lot for the community.

137
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to see that.

138
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,492
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.

139
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good people.

140
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:33,499
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked to them about different things that has been brought to our attention.

141
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're right there to take care of it.

142
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,142
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no problems at all.

143
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the kind of business that you want.

144
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great location.

145
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:45,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to know they're doing well.

146
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:46,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are.

147
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,367
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions I personally have, right?

148
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, listen, no, no, no.

149
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,169
[SPEAKER_01]: We got liquor stores.

150
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,490
[SPEAKER_01]: You got breweries.

151
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: We got restaurants.

152
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:04,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the restaurants, all different kinds of restaurants.

153
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:09,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have, I guess, the VFW, the American Legion.

154
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a few other clubs in Method.

155
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,560
[SPEAKER_01]: The Yelps and so on and so forth.

156
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:20,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you briefly give us an idea?

157
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine it's not the same, like a liquor store is a different license.

158
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:30,084
[SPEAKER_01]: What are all the different licenses that are available?

159
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:37,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were four categories of retail liquor licenses.

160
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:38,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

161
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:45,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Category one, it's all alcoholic beverages, which is wine,

162
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,875
[SPEAKER_00]: malt and distilled spirits.

163
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

164
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Then category number two is wine only.

165
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Category number three is malt beverages only.

166
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:05,627
[SPEAKER_00]: In category number four is wine and malt beverages.

167
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:12,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I brought up the categories is because

168
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:19,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you're looking for are the different license types, different business categories.

169
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:27,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like you said, restaurants, breweries and clubs and stuff like that.

170
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:27,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

171
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:34,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are and in the classifications of retail licenses.

172
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:43,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So they call it a Section 12 license, which is in Mass General Laws, Chapter 138.

173
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:46,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an on-premise pouring license.

174
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,668
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they'll use in

175
00:13:51,471 --> 00:14:05,217
[SPEAKER_00]: hotels, restaurants, clubs, you know, all establishments like that that are on-premise.

176
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:07,738
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to enjoy the alcoholic beverages on the premise.

177
00:14:07,998 --> 00:14:08,998
[SPEAKER_01]: On the premise, right.

178
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a Section 14 license, which is a one-day license.

179
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:22,860
[SPEAKER_00]: and people come to us for this one-day license but when they're having special events in the city.

180
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:38,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I brought up the categories earlier is because a non-profit can come to us for a one-day license and we can grant them a one-day all-alcoholic beverage license.

181
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,770
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not

182
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:45,950
[SPEAKER_00]: non-profit, they can only have a wine and malt license.

183
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, when you say wine and malt, people, it's beer, right?

184
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:50,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer, correct.

185
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:50,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

186
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:55,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beer, hard cider, things like that.

187
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the one-day license, it's good.

188
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:02,037
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we ask them to provide insurance.

189
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:09,921
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to come up with a quarter million dollars of liability insurance for the event.

190
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:22,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to give us a drawing, just a sketch drawing to show us where the alcohol is planning on being served, if it's going to be sectioned off.

191
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:29,926
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously we don't want people leaving the event, walking the streets with a bottle of beer in their hand or whatever.

192
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:39,534
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll only grant 30 one-day licenses to the same person per year.

193
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:40,535
[SPEAKER_00]: We cap it as that.

194
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,363
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't make like a side business out of it type of thing.

195
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:46,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.

197
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:49,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

198
00:15:51,365 --> 00:16:01,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing with it too, a licensed establishment that's already licensed in the city cannot have a one day license on their premise.

199
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:10,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So say, you know, they wanted to pull a one-day license for a wedding or something, it's a special event, they can't do it.

200
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:16,151
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have it on their premise, privately, and do whatever, they don't need a one-day license.

201
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:29,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person pulling the license also cannot be in application for a regular license, you know, if it's pending or whatever.

202
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:31,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the,

203
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:38,200
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, the last classification is a section 15, which is the package store licenses.

204
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And the package store licenses are in a group of their own.

205
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:50,849
[SPEAKER_00]: There are none available in the city of Medford.

206
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,431
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the maximum.

207
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,733
[SPEAKER_00]: We only are allowed 12 by the state.

208
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:57,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have.

209
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,417
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so a quick question now.

210
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

211
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:03,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 12 of them.

212
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all gone.

213
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:08,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't open another liquor store, I take it, right?

214
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,738
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get a license.

215
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless one of them closes or sells.

216
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

217
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what my question was going to be.

218
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:26,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone comes in and wants to buy a liquor store, someone selling the liquor store, they can get that license when they buy that liquor store.

219
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how it works, or is it more complicated?

220
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,618
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much how it works.

221
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:43,080
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if somebody wants to buy a license, it's basically we have a transmittal form it's called.

222
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

223
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of edits the license and that'll allow this person to have the license transferred over to them.

224
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:59,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And the protocol of it, it's basically the same as a brand new license.

225
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,564
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need the same information.

226
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:06,770
[SPEAKER_00]: They still need to notify the public with mail.

227
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,177
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to follow all the rules and stuff about where they're at.

228
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:18,126
[SPEAKER_00]: If the only difference is now the license becomes available.

229
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:23,928
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a transfer versus a new license because there's no new license available.

230
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having 13 licenses, it's still going to remain 12.

231
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to remain 12.

232
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still have to fill out everything exactly the same as a brand new license.

233
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:34,951
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

234
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

235
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to apply for a license.

236
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:40,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

237
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:42,344
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

238
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,125
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like?

239
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take care of you, John.

240
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:49,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.

241
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:56,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I just coming into the city, you know, I don't have a business elsewhere.

242
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to open a restaurant.

243
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:58,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to serve liquor.

244
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I go to City Hall?

245
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I go to the, like, how would I get, you know, we don't need like all the little details, but how do you get the process started?

246
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:08,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would I go to?

247
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:34,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, um, if you wanted to open in the city of Medford, you'd start at city hall and, um, in, in, you know, you'd go to the mayor's office and they'd refer you to Daria and Daria would probably tell you, first thing you want to do is log on to the website for the ABCC alcoholic beverage control commission, Massachusetts.

248
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,192
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a phenomenal site.

249
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:37,693
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, um,

250
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:43,829
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's basically just point and click.

251
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start a new retail business?

252
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:47,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do this?

253
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do that?

254
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you click it, it brings you to the next step.

255
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:55,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of walks you through what you need to have in the steps you need to take.

256
00:19:56,241 --> 00:20:00,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to tell you to download the application form.

257
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,106
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the same throughout the state.

258
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:07,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to fill that out.

259
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:13,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions, you can contact ARIA with questions.

260
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:29,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we recommend is that you may want to, most people will hire an attorney that specializes in Chapter 138 laws, because it's a little tricky to fill this form out by yourself.

261
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:45,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to pay all the fees to the state, the local licensing authority, and when all of that's complete, you'll present this application to the local licensing authority, which is us, for approval.

262
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:53,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll ask you questions, we'll review the whole application, and if we feel as though

263
00:20:54,284 --> 00:21:02,107
[SPEAKER_00]: that you qualify and everything's been filled out correctly, then we'll approve it.

264
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:08,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we approve it at that point, the next step is we send it to the ABCC.

265
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:09,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

266
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And they assign an investigator to it for approval.

267
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they approve it,

268
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,822
[SPEAKER_00]: then it comes back to us.

269
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:24,086
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will issue the license upon payment of the licensing fee.

270
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:24,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

271
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:30,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're talking, I mean, a couple of three months maybe.

272
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:36,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It's timelines on all of this.

273
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:41,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start it, we have so many days to approve it.

274
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's so many days for the ABCC to work on it and approve it.

275
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty smooth process.

276
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it in a nutshell.

277
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:54,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

278
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:59,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a lot to do, but I thank you for explaining all that.

279
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:05,521
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned fees, you mentioned costs, so I'm on a tight budget, all right?

280
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want you to know that right now.

281
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:08,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to come.

282
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,892
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my cost gonna be, nevermind anything else, just to get the license and pay the fees, whatever they are?

283
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:25,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you wanted to do an application.

284
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:26,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

285
00:22:26,274 --> 00:22:33,257
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a local licensing authority, which is the city of Medford's fees.

286
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,437
[SPEAKER_00]: For wine and malt, it's $350.

287
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:36,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, easy.

288
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, piece of cake.

289
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of nights out going to dinner.

290
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all.

291
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:51,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you wanted to go with an all alcohol, um, which is like a restaurant or whatever, you'd be $450.

292
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:51,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

293
00:22:51,676 --> 00:23:02,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted a section 14, one day license, it would be $60 unless you were nonprofit, then it's free.

294
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,641
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't charge you.

295
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:10,565
[SPEAKER_00]: But now keep in mind, keep in mind, these are only application fees.

296
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:11,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

297
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:13,693
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the cost of your license.

298
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:15,514
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, I know the license.

299
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:16,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting.

300
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:18,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're saving the good stuff for the end.

301
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,137
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, yeah.

302
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:30,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So the look at the City of Medford's local licensing authority yearly fees for entertainment because we handle the entertainment licenses as well.

303
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

304
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,565
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred dollars per category.

305
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:41,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And categories of by devices, meaning television, stereos, things like that.

306
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,689
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have up to 10 devices for the $100.

307
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And then performance, it is, it is.

308
00:23:52,392 --> 00:24:03,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And performers, that's if you want to have performers come in like a band or whatever, that's another $100 for that part of the license.

309
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:13,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to have patrons, performances by patrons, karaoke, things like that, that's another $100.

310
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:18,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually they pay $300 for the year, covers them up for all three things.

311
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:19,526
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad at all.

312
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:20,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

313
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:26,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the all alcohol license for a restaurant, you're looking at $2,000 per year.

314
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:34,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And City of Medford, believe it or not, is a lot less money than some of the surrounding cities and towns.

315
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what they are.

316
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:45,768
[SPEAKER_00]: One point a couple of years ago, we kind of looked at other cities and towns, but Malton Wine, if you want to have just Malton Wine, $1,500.

317
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:56,292
[SPEAKER_00]: The Farmer Series Pouring, which is the Medford Brewery, that's $1,000.

318
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

319
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:05,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they, we don't issue them the license, the state issues them the license.

320
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:06,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

321
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're a pharma series growing company.

322
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:09,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

323
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,720
[SPEAKER_00]: We issue, we issue them the pouring license.

324
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

325
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:15,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's what the thousand dollars is.

326
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

327
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:18,362
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned clubs.

328
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,062
[SPEAKER_00]: The clubs are $500 a piece per year.

329
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:29,031
[SPEAKER_00]: and a package store is $1,500 for the year.

330
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's every year.

331
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:37,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get the license, mine's going to cost $2,000, and then it's $2,000 the following year.

332
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

333
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,861
[SPEAKER_01]: That's every year.

334
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:40,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

335
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:40,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year.

336
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:42,123
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad at all.

337
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:44,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I thought for some reason I'm thinking

338
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:50,790
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I go into a restaurant and they serve alcohol and everything else.

339
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they would be paying a lot more than two grand.

340
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's... No, that's all it is.

341
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:57,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad at all.

342
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:57,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

343
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:01,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, it's good.

344
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:05,592
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not trying to kill anybody and stuff.

345
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:09,913
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's just kind of like, you know, I feel as though everything is fair.

346
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:13,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you just... If we can keep it that way, why not?

347
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:14,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

348
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:15,534
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not bad.

349
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:22,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Mike, really, that's, geez, I might see if I can get a partner or two and who knows.

350
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,271
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

351
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:26,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I can't help you out with that one.

352
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:31,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough, yeah, that's a tough industry, you know, a lot of work and doing that.

353
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:32,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

354
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:32,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

355
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough to restaurant business.

356
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:39,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, we've got some great restaurants in Method.

357
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:39,934
[SPEAKER_01]: We really do.

358
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very lucky in this city, you know?

359
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:43,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

360
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:46,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some very nice restaurants.

361
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, they've been good.

362
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:52,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been on a little over a couple of years, but you know, we've we've seen a few come in.

363
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:57,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a few come in, but the guys before me have really in Jim, Jim Flynn.

364
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:02,340
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the chair commissioner for many years beforehand.

365
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim did a great job.

366
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:09,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, he got to the age that he wanted to retire and spend time with the grandkids and stuff.

367
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he's a good guy.

368
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:13,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are doing a good job.

369
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,835
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say.

370
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:17,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all sounds good.

371
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:21,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Those prices are more than reasonable.

372
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had mentioned earlier about the licenses, what's available, and everything else.

373
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:29,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was great.

374
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to ask one more thing.

375
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess John Petrolla comes into Medford.

376
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:45,338
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I open a restaurant, do everything, get the license.

377
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I love Method so much that I open another restaurant.

378
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then that restaurant, because I'm a great cook, Bobby, okay?

379
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:55,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine.

380
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal cook.

381
00:27:57,528 --> 00:28:01,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So that restaurant, you know, naturally takes off.

382
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:05,515
[SPEAKER_01]: How many, am I limited

383
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,551
[SPEAKER_01]: to how many restaurants I can open in Metfit?

384
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a limit?

385
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:14,875
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, three, four, or I can?

386
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:26,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for all alcohol on premise, we currently have 28 licenses available.

387
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Petrella can open 28 restaurants if he wants.

388
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:30,583
[SPEAKER_01]: No kidding.

389
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:32,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

390
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:33,245
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no limit.

391
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:39,193
[SPEAKER_00]: section 12 licenses which are on premise.

392
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:40,594
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting, yeah.

393
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:46,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got four Malton wines available too and no package to us.

394
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:51,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised there's that many available.

395
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's a good thing, you know.

396
00:28:54,239 --> 00:29:00,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the way the state sets that up that they give you so many per thousand people.

397
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:03,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh okay, so it's based on population?

398
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:08,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it's the same with the package stores.

399
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:22,912
[SPEAKER_00]: We're close to being eligible for one more package store, but I don't know if it's going to happen in the near future because they only re-evaluate that every five years when the federal census comes out.

400
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:28,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a little while, and it's going to be close.

401
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:30,433
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can.

402
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,625
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was package stores, that's a different story.

403
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:42,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Package store, you could open up to nine in the state.

404
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:49,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you lived in a town, you could only have one in the town.

405
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,579
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a city, you can have up to two in the city.

406
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

407
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.

408
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:56,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of stuff

409
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:02,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I've been in my share of bars, as you know, and restaurants.

410
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:16,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, interesting to know that most people, most people wouldn't have any clue about all that, you know, well, back in the day, when I was in the liquor business 40 years ago, they capped it off at three.

411
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:17,878
[SPEAKER_00]: for package stores.

412
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:18,838
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did.

413
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:19,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

414
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:19,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

415
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:29,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the big, the big stores, like you're at Atlas and all of that back then, they, you know, they used to find ways around it.

416
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, legally, legally.

417
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:33,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I know.

418
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:34,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

419
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:38,388
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, that's the way it was.

420
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:42,930
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, then the state moved it up from three to five, and five to seven.

421
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:46,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just went up from seven to nine not too long ago.

422
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, there's a lot of information, a lot of stuff.

423
00:30:50,844 --> 00:30:56,607
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now I got to get into the stuff, the real good stuff now.

424
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the tough question.

425
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:00,829
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to name names.

426
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to say who's what.

427
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can't.

428
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:06,192
[SPEAKER_01]: You figured that.

429
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:14,436
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the question is, I open a business.

430
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:15,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fine.

431
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:22,168
[SPEAKER_01]: What types of violations would I run into trouble with?

432
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:26,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that could cause a non-renewal?

433
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:43,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's kind of a tough question, but I'm just curious if, and I don't know if it ever happens, but are there reasons where they'd have to come before you guys and explain what happened or what's going on?

434
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, there is.

435
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a process for that.

436
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,893
[SPEAKER_00]: We hold hearings.

437
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:50,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

438
00:31:51,614 --> 00:32:06,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if something comes to our attention, either through the police or we have three offices assigned to our commission, and they do the investigating and the, you know,

439
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:15,496
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are associated with on or off premises, uh, your licenses.

440
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:22,958
[SPEAKER_00]: They, um, say John Petrella buys a restaurant doing great, blah, blah, blah.

441
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,959
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's doing so good.

442
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,360
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts doing stuff he's not supposed to do.

443
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's buying Ferraris and Maseratis and everything else.

444
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can't afford them.

445
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So he starts selling drugs.

446
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:37,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

447
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:38,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

448
00:32:39,571 --> 00:33:05,887
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going back to the old days yeah yeah so you got if you cannot have an on-premise section 12 license if you've been convicted of a drug crime okay that makes sense yeah so if you do that and your license comes up in renewal for renewal and you can't renew it okay that that'll cause you not to renew it yeah

449
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:16,883
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things that would cause you not to be able to renew your license is the state, not the local licensing authority, but the state is very strict on renewals.

450
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:19,184
[SPEAKER_00]: They start November 1st.

451
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:29,928
[SPEAKER_00]: All the paperwork has to be in to the local licensing authority by the last day in November with the fees.

452
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not completed by then,

453
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:38,760
[SPEAKER_00]: December 1st, you're required to apply for a whole new license.

454
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,723
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not be issued a license.

455
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:42,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty strict, right?

456
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, very strict.

457
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:45,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strict.

458
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:51,858
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want, we send out two or three, Daria sends out two or three emails to all the licensees explaining this.

459
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:55,815
[SPEAKER_00]: uh also telling them what forms they need.

460
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,656
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to show us their insurance.

461
00:33:57,776 --> 00:34:02,100
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to show us that the building department and fire department have inspected them.

462
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:12,969
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to show us now the past year we started we want to see the common vitual is licensed because that's how we can set their hours for serving alcohol.

463
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you know food if there's no food they can't drink.

464
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:22,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can only put the hours on that they're serving food instead of the max hours

465
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:36,600
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to go a little longer, then they got to go before the city council and get permission to extend the common vigilance, then it's up to us to grant the liquor license.

466
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,862
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for that.

467
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:53,591
[SPEAKER_00]: In violations, as you mentioned, of license rules, it's basically any violations of the city of Medford license rules and regulations and Mass General Law, Chapter 138,

468
00:34:55,333 --> 00:35:03,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most common ones are selling or serving alcohol to a person under 21 years of age.

469
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I figured that was going to be the, yeah.

470
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:12,167
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is over serving or selling alcohol to an intoxicated person.

471
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:20,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone's in your bar and they're staggering up to the bar and slurring their words and want another drink and your bartender serves them,

472
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:24,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a violation.

473
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:35,700
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, same thing that an intoxicated person walks into a package store and wants to buy, you know, a half pint or whatever, and they sell them, that's considered over serving as well.

474
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things like that.

475
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:50,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, one thing is the city of Medford, we do compliance checks on all licensees at random times throughout the year.

476
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,531
[SPEAKER_00]: They never know when we're coming in and when we're testing them.

477
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:57,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.

478
00:35:58,412 --> 00:35:59,512
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it from the police.

479
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:13,598
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but so they'll get an 18-year-old to go in and buy at a package store or try and get a drink in a bar, restaurant, whatever.

480
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:16,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're saying or something like that?

481
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:17,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

482
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:18,519
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that.

483
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:18,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

484
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:35,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have quite a, it's done pretty pat, you know, as far as telling the kids what to do, making the kids even take a breathalyzer before they go out.

485
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:39,003
[SPEAKER_00]: and do these compliance checks.

486
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:45,265
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give them cash money with the serial numbers recorded on the bills.

487
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:55,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they really do it upright and they have it set up in a way that the kids cannot get hurt and the kids cannot lie.

488
00:36:55,568 --> 00:37:02,309
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go into a place and order a beer and the waitress says, you have an ID?

489
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, I'm sorry, I don't.

490
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they say, well, how old are you?

491
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,643
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kid's 18, they got to say they're 18.

492
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:14,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this restaurant will say, sorry, we can't serve you.

493
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:17,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get up and leave.

494
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:18,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good.

495
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:25,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And this here is not to punish anybody or anything.

496
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,310
[SPEAKER_00]: ABCC and us call it education.

497
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:37,495
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's educating the licensees on what the limitations are, what they can do and what they can't do.

498
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's part of this whole education thing.

499
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:47,380
[SPEAKER_00]: We even started having the ABCC come in once a year for a mandate.

500
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We require all of our licensees mandatory to come to that meeting.

501
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,683
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasts about an hour and a half.

502
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:55,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ABCC...

503
00:37:56,271 --> 00:38:04,013
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells them all the new stuff for the year, goes over all the important things that they bring in the state, unemployment.

504
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they really do a great job.

505
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:07,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good, yeah.

506
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody gets something out of it.

507
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,696
[SPEAKER_00]: They enjoy it, the licensees, you know?

508
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:12,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it should be.

509
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:14,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really great.

510
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:18,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no excuse not to know what's right and wrong, you know?

511
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:24,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think everyone's learning something tonight because there's a lot of stuff that I had no idea.

512
00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I really did.

513
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most people don't unless you're involved in it, you know, right?

514
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's good to know.

515
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:38,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, yes, I had no idea how many licenses were available and, you know, all the things that go on with it.

516
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:42,501
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so I paid you a lot of money the city.

517
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:46,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say it's public information.

518
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:46,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I get $1,500 a year.

519
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were 10 months out of the year.

520
00:38:52,625 --> 00:39:01,513
[SPEAKER_00]: We had July and August off, but this is the first year we ever got August off.

521
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:10,580
[SPEAKER_00]: All the years that the other guys have been on and I've been on, something always comes up and we'll always just go and have the meeting.

522
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,901
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a big deal.

523
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:16,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really are doing a big service to the city.

524
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is important stuff.

525
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:20,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We joke around and everything else, but it is.

526
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,749
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important job.

527
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,991
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, because it can cost somebody their life.

528
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:25,952
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

529
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:27,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

530
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:27,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

531
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:37,599
[SPEAKER_00]: You let somebody go out and drive when they're hammered, walking out of your establishment, and kill somebody, then it becomes a real problem.

532
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a, I forget,

533
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:53,871
[SPEAKER_00]: state that when a drunk driver is stopped and the police arrest them or do whatever, they can't pass the breathalyzer.

534
00:39:54,271 --> 00:40:00,975
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a report that comes out from the state every year because they ask that person, where are you coming from?

535
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:09,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I've been on as a commissioner, which has been a little over two years,

536
00:40:11,818 --> 00:40:13,539
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had one come from Medford.

537
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:14,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

538
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,540
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

539
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,420
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because of me.

540
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:19,142
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been going on for a long time.

541
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:20,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Give yourself a little credit.

542
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:24,285
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

543
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:27,386
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the licensees in the city doing the right thing.

544
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:29,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good.

545
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:29,667
[SPEAKER_00]: They care.

546
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,628
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole process.

547
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:36,111
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving license to the right people, good people, and on and on.

548
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:37,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

549
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:40,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very interesting stuff.

550
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:44,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm gonna ask you one last question, okay?

551
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:44,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

552
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:50,657
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I opened that third restaurant, things aren't going so good in that third restaurant, okay?

553
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:51,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

554
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:55,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the license, so I'm gonna sell it.

555
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:09,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I don't know if this makes any sense, but am I able to sell that license with the business or you guys get the, I'm just curious.

556
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:16,064
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell the license with the business, but nobody's going to give you any money for it.

557
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:17,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

558
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,187
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as there are licenses available.

559
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:20,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Available.

560
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:21,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

561
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:22,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

562
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:27,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So what'll happen is if you don't like that they're in business, you can transfer the license.

563
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:31,918
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sale of the business.

564
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:37,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sell the business for whatever you think the business is worth, but you're not going to get any money for the license.

565
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:49,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the same, now let me ask you this question and I don't even know if you can answer it, but say it's not Method, say it's in a city, say it's Boston and there's no more licenses left.

566
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:50,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

567
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:57,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just asking you this because years ago, I know a few people that own bars in Boston and

568
00:41:59,593 --> 00:42:03,054
[SPEAKER_01]: those liquor license were worth a lot of money.

569
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,935
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it, the limit, it was tough to get one.

570
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:13,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say Boston, there's no more licenses available.

571
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:18,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it legal for them to sell it is what I'm saying.

572
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,501
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm asking.

573
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:20,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is.

574
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:25,903
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason being is a friend of mine,

575
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:34,908
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm obviously not going to mention his name or the business name, had a restaurant in Somerville and there were no licenses available at the time.

576
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,768
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a perfect example, yeah.

577
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:46,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And his business wasn't doing too well, but he was able to sell the business, but he got a lot more money for it because of the license.

578
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,510
[SPEAKER_01]: The license, okay.

579
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:49,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had

580
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:54,614
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I asked him, you know, how do you go about doing it?

581
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:55,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't on the commission then.

582
00:42:56,455 --> 00:43:10,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that basically the people that are going to be buying his business have to apply for the license and they have to be approved by the local licensing authority and the ABCC.

583
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:19,843
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that's all approved, then they could go through with the sale and the transfer of the license.

584
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:26,940
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have any problem getting the money for it, and the state didn't bother anybody, or the city didn't bother anybody.

585
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would imagine, yeah.

586
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:31,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking if it's not available, it's gonna be worse.

587
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:42,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, even, well, I know of one instance that an entity came into the city of Medford,

588
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:56,714
[SPEAKER_00]: that needed a liquor, section 15 package store license, and they were not available, and they were able to purchase one from an existing store.

589
00:43:56,954 --> 00:43:57,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

590
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:58,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that makes sense.

591
00:43:59,335 --> 00:43:59,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

592
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:07,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, that store person was probably ready to settle or get out or whatever, and they told them the license, basically.

593
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,500
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it can be done.

594
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,902
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are any licenses available,

595
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,330
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna say, well, I'm not paying you for a license.

596
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get one for free.

597
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:20,652
[SPEAKER_01]: To buy and demand.

598
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:21,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

599
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:22,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

600
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:26,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, listen, you know, I had a great time.

601
00:44:26,173 --> 00:44:27,934
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this like, really.

602
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:29,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.

603
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because I learned a lot.

604
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:36,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, and I think our audience, I'm so happy we asked you to come on.
