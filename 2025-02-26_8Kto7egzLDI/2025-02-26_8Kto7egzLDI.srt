[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

18
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:26,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I thought I saw the agenda too, because that's where you get the link, because it's all on there.

19
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:27,627
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:32,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not pulling up either for me on my computer here, the link or the agenda.

21

[SPEAKER_02]: Director of World Language, sorry about that.

132
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

133
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for this opportunity for us to speak to you this evening on what we're looking at as an upgraded opportunity for our students to be truly immersed in our world languages program at Medford High School and within the Medford public schools.

134
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:33,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself and Dr. Bebo will be presenting to you this evening on this tremendous opportunity.

135
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: So benefits of an exchange program really gives students a true better understanding of different cultural and community perspectives and also gives students an opportunity for a increased interest in global issues.

136
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:58,984
[SPEAKER_07]: A true exchange program also provides students an opportunity to be immersed in their experience with their host families

137
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:08,262
[SPEAKER_07]: but to also not simply be voyeurs as they travel through a country and briefly engage with the experiences.

138
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:11,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Beveau, would you like to add anything at this time?

139
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:13,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

140
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having us tonight.

141
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:29,894
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal experience with the exchange program in another district has been that, besides the tremendous opportunity that kids have while traveling to another country and make friends, but then creating those lifelong

142
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,316
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with those students.

143
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:42,379
[SPEAKER_00]: The students come back, so they have the opportunity, or vice versa, they have the opportunity to see those students and to visit each other's countries and families and interact with each other.

144
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:58,045
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful opportunity because they built something beyond what a normal trip will give, and they really immerse themselves to the language and the culture of the country that they're visiting.

145
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:05,113
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow me, I can explain a little bit more of how this came about.

146
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:15,526
[SPEAKER_00]: We were approached by a school in Italy, in a Veneto area, northeast of Italy, near Venice.

147
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:29,435
[SPEAKER_00]: The school as they provide us with all the benefits and the structure that the school is that they have to offer is a nice school, just like ours, a little smaller.

148
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,677
[SPEAKER_00]: They have traveled to the United States before.

149
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:37,379
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I believe they have a trip scheduled now to Chicago.

150
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:40,175
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would like to come to Massachusetts.

151
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:43,457
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been in Massachusetts before, hosted by another district.

152
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:49,621
[SPEAKER_00]: But the district that were hosted before, they did not want to go back to Venice, so they approached us.

153
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely people.

154
00:37:52,302 --> 00:38:01,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I have communicated with the teachers several times, and they would like to come to visit us in October, next October, 2025.

155
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:06,530
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will go then visit them in April 2026.

156
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:13,772
[SPEAKER_00]: The dates are still to be determined because we want to make sure that everybody's on board.

157
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:21,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Them, just like us, they need to propose this to their school committee and they need to approve the dates.

158
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,442
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we are busy organizing what this exchange can look like.

159
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:33,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of Medford, this will be a pilot program.

160
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:42,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We are planning to try this and see how this goes with a small group of 10 to 15 students.

161
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,860
[SPEAKER_00]: but the group that is coming from Italy will be more or less the same amount.

162
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,142
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about 15, maximum 17 students, again, high school students.

163
00:38:56,342 --> 00:39:01,624
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that these students will be hosted by our family, our community.

164
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:15,108
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next step will be if this pilot program will be approved, the next step will be to involve the community and see who would like to host

165
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:25,854
[SPEAKER_00]: students and teachers, two teachers from Italy and two teachers, possibly a third chaperone going to Italy from Medford going to Italy.

166
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:38,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have the interested parties, we will have conversation meetings with the families, what to expect.

167
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:42,824
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a conversation with the travel agency.

168
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:59,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we embarked in this beautiful initiative, we consulted with local schools district, they have already years of experience with exchange programs.

169
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:08,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were, between all the recommendations that we got, we were recommended to contact Promotor.

170
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:18,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Promotor seems to be an agency, a travel agency, who has a steady program in terms of dealing with exchange programs.

171
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:22,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we immediately contact them.

172
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:30,761
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been very responsive and they already provided us with a package of what our exchange program will look like.

173
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:35,263
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a few more minutes, I can briefly tell you how this is going to look.

174
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:48,080
[SPEAKER_00]: For Medford, so when we go, we're talking about 10 days during April vacation, 2026, and we will arrive to Venice from Venice.

175
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,143
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to the school in near Venice.

176
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:56,258
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take the train to go to Mugliano.

177
00:40:56,598 --> 00:41:03,124
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be welcomed there and we'll meet students, faculty, and families.

178
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:09,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the students will go to their respective families together with the teachers, teachers as well.

179
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:16,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will spend, within these 10 days, we will spend five, six days in the school.

180
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,678
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging with a school program and etc.

181
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:41,250
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be in their schools, in their school, and the other days we'll be traveling to Milano, Milan, Venice, of course, and Verona, and I'm missing something, Venice, Verona, Milano, and I thought I had something else.

182
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,411
[SPEAKER_00]: but those are the, or perhaps Treviso.

183
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:49,014
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all local cities, surrounding cities.

184
00:41:49,754 --> 00:42:01,640
[SPEAKER_00]: The promotor will guide us, will have a guide, will take us to these places, will visit museums, local historical places,

185
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:21,346
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will provide children with our kids with a meal, a lunch, and then this will be one-day trips, and we'll return to Mogliano that evening, and kids will go back to their respective families.

186
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we'll do another city, we'll repeat the same thing.

187
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:27,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pause for a second.

188
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:31,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, I know there's probably so much curiosity.

189
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:43,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the beginning of organizing this, of brainstorming, so there's still so much work to be done, but I would, if you have any questions,

190
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:52,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the travel includes an insurance, cancellation insurance.

191
00:42:54,096 --> 00:43:01,438
[SPEAKER_00]: If students need to come back over here for a medical reason, the packet includes all of this.

192
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Meals, transportation, meals, all of it.

193
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing?

194
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:23,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are also just so the committee is aware because this has been an issue previously, we are offering for $52 included in the overall price, it cancel at any time policy up to 48 hours prior to departure.

195
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:28,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So our families will have that opportunity, and I believe it's $52.25.

196
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:31,998
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really great opportunity.

197
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:38,523
[SPEAKER_07]: The students, as Dr. Bebo mentioned, will be visiting us in October.

198
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:44,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Exact dates yet to be determined, and we expect 17 students to visit

199
00:43:44,607 --> 00:43:49,049
[SPEAKER_07]: with their Medford High School host families during that time.

200
00:43:49,650 --> 00:44:10,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then in April 15th, 2025, I'm sorry, April 15th to the 25th of 2026, so just about 14 months away, we will depart in a pilot with a very small group, 15 students, to stay with Italian host families and to participate in their school and cultural experiences.

201
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:17,868
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a program that is brand new to Medford and something that we're very excited to take the opportunity to try.

202
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:29,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So academic requirements requiring a 90 commutative average in world language classes, overall 83 semester average.

203
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:33,965
[SPEAKER_07]: No suspensions, academic dishonesty, or pattern of inappropriate behavior.

204
00:44:34,825 --> 00:44:46,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Attendance and participation in orientation meetings leading up to this for both the host families as well as our students who will be living with the Italian host families.

205
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a journaling of their observations from the trip.

206
00:44:52,797 --> 00:44:53,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions?

207
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:57,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll stop the share briefly, but to see if there are any questions from the committee at this time.

208
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:03,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both very much for the good presentation.

209
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a great opportunity.

210
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from the chair?

211
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:06,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion for approval?

212
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:13,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to approve.

213
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:14,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited.

214
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

215
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval by member Olapade.

216
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Second by Member Bramley.

217
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I call the roll, Member Cabra, do you have any questions?

218
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:26,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just one quick question.

219
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:46,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Just looking at the climate and especially with traveling and, you know, everything that's going on, do we expect that any possible executive orders or any of the already written executive orders may have an impact on the implementation of this program, just so that we're aware and we understand any risks that may come with it?

220
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:51,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Member Intapa.

221
00:45:51,424 --> 00:46:08,718
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, and obviously there have been a host of executive orders, nothing at this time leads us to believe that there will be any impact on our travel to Italy or Italian students attending school here for the two weeks.

222
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:10,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

223
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to just double check on that.

224
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:17,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously it's ever changing, but for the time being, before we vote, I just want to know.

225
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:18,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So appreciate it.

226
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:23,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you for the questions.

227
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:25,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, if you could call the roll.

228
00:46:25,068 --> 00:46:27,569
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Member Bramley.

229
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:29,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had a question.

230
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Member Reinfeld.

231
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think my hand is the same color as my wall.

232
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:40,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what happens if demand exceeds supply on this one.

233
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:43,774
[SPEAKER_04]: This is super exciting, and I think a lot of people will be interested.

234
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:47,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are some really real financial challenges for equity.

235
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the protocol?

236
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:53,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take that.

237
00:46:54,825 --> 00:47:00,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of if it becomes, you mean if it becomes very popular and more kids?

238
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: If more people want to do this then there is room for it.

239
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:10,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to be a host family to be an exchange family or just for your student to go?

240
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:11,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that

241
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:16,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm understanding your question.

242
00:47:17,675 --> 00:47:26,449
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, the, no, the Oosting family doesn't necessarily need to go to Italy to Oost.

243
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:31,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, that will be the real exchange.

244
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:39,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So my daughter would host with my daughter going to Medford, for example, and then my daughter will go to Italy.

245
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:44,722
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be the real exchange, the real meaning of the exchange.

246
00:47:44,782 --> 00:47:48,544
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, if that doesn't align, it will be okay.

247
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:51,565
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's okay with the family, it's okay.

248
00:47:51,946 --> 00:47:56,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I understood your question, I think you also had a financial question.

249
00:47:56,788 --> 00:48:08,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing and I are working to also get some, to look into some scholarships to help these students.

250
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:12,197
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices of this trip is very far more economical.

251
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:16,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is a very competitive price from what I've seen of Europe, but it is still

252
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's still, of course, it's hefty.

253
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:21,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Every trip is hefty.

254
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:27,892
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already looking into scholarship to try to, in fact, actually, I'm anticipating something.

255
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:41,095
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something coming later that Mr. Cushing is going to present that I already asked if that could be part of this program, could be included as part of this program.

256
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:43,618
[SPEAKER_00]: a recent fund that we just received.

257
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,083
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be looking on that too.

258
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.

259
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was just wondering if what if more people want to go than there are more than 15 students.

260
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:58,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So for this trip, for this trip, we will be having to have a hard cap as this is our first time.

261
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:09,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really want to make sure that students that we really want to make sure that we as an organization, this is a significant shift in our travel practices.

262
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:13,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really want to make sure that as an organization, we do this well.

263
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:21,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And we understand that, you know, how our students are operating within other families homes.

264
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:36,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And so in speaking with Dr. Bebeau, we just want to be cautious on this first one before we launch, hopefully what will in the future be a significantly larger group.

265
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:45,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that we may have some families who are disappointed, but I think what our, not I think, I know that our plan is to start with seniors,

266
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:51,039
[SPEAKER_07]: and then work down through the world languages so that there'll be opportunities in the future.

267
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:58,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully this becomes an annual experience, not just for Italy, but for other opportunities, other nations.

268
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That age prioritization was, I think, what I was getting at.

269
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

270
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:10,467
[SPEAKER_02]: No further questions?

271
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

[SPEAKER_07]: I missed the window to hand my daughter Mackenzie off, so she's joining me right now.

296
00:50:58,344 --> 00:50:59,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

297
00:50:59,044 --> 00:51:01,305
[SPEAKER_07]: She's being much louder than I anticipated.

298
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:17,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So the job descriptions, one of the things that we've been doing over the last several years is updating and reviewing our job descriptions with the supplemental budget thanks to the approval of the overrides in Medford.

299
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,633
[SPEAKER_07]: We have added an assistant facilities director.

300
00:51:23,534 --> 00:51:27,458
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to hire that position, we needed to create a new job description.

301
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:36,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I will screen share that with the committee right now and take any feedback or comments you may have.

302
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:42,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Branley?

303
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:45,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question.

304
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:51,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we already have the facilities director, the position filled?

305
00:51:51,588 --> 00:52:02,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me or can I just not hear Peter?

306
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,739
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you and the answer is yes.

307
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:07,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I apologize.

308
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know if I was muted or unmuted.

309
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:18,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the position is filled right now, but the job description has not been updated and I don't know how long it's not dated.

310
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:34,677
[SPEAKER_07]: and what we did was we took a look for both of these at a significant number, about 12 districts in all honesty, to really compile the expectations around these job descriptions.

311
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:38,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the first one on the agenda is actually the assistant facilities director.

312
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I able to have like a point of clarification?

313
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:44,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

314
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:57,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important for the context of having the job description for an assistant facilities director to see the job description for the director position.

315
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:13,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're able to see what the demands and the expectations and the requirements are for the director position when we're looking and viewing what's needed for an assistant director position.

316
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:14,988
[SPEAKER_12]: if that makes sense.

317
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:17,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so who is the facility's director?

318
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,750
[SPEAKER_12]: John McLaughlin.

319
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,651
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's what I thought.

320
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:23,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm like, no, he's building in grounds.

321
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, is that the same thing?

322
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't know if we were trying to approve two positions.

323
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:33,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to make sure for clarity that I was on the same... Yep, you are.

324
00:53:34,856 --> 00:53:42,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Bramley, the language is updated to really recognize how the field has changed.

325
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

326
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:49,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

327
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:50,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

328
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Just another small clarification before Dr. Cushing dives in here.

329
00:53:57,146 --> 00:54:10,517
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee is required to approve all job descriptions and we have not had a wonderful history of doing that work.

330
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:12,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of

331
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: This is to get back on track around making sure that there are controls in place about our job descriptions.

332
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:38,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know that the job for the facilities director has been filled for quite some time, but I would also bet money that at that time, the job description didn't come before the school committee because that wasn't part of the typical pathway at that time.

333
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:42,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're going to approve both tonight or amend and approve.

334
00:54:43,623 --> 00:54:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree, I think it's really important to know how these two positions are supposed to work together.

335
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:57,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have a couple of questions once Dr. Cushing goes through this one, whenever you're ready, Mayor.

336
00:54:58,568 --> 00:54:59,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

337
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:09,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, I was just putting in the chat, is there any chance, Dr. Cushing, you could increase the font size just so especially the recording grabs it?

338
00:55:14,382 --> 00:55:15,863
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just give me one second here.

339
00:55:16,183 --> 00:55:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: How did it come up so tiny?

340
00:55:20,547 --> 00:55:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's because I have a rather large monitor at home instead of two monitors.

341
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:29,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me just try to do that.

342
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:32,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually.

343
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:39,863
[SPEAKER_09]: No rush.

344
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, can you just, yeah.

345
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:54,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that better or would it be better if I stop share and someone else shares given a little bit bigger.

346
00:55:54,426 --> 00:55:55,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

347
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,169
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

348
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:00,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, perfect.

349
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:01,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

350
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:07,293
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

351
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:18,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So as the as the community moves forward facilities director definitely altering the name but trying to understand what is going on in the industry and what our school.

352
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:21,466
[SPEAKER_07]: really needs as we look for this position.

353
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:28,391
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not to say the Building and Ground Director is outdated, but just want to make this a more contemporary piece.

354
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:37,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at FLSA, which is the Fair Labor Standards Act, if I'm correct, and 260 days with flexible hours of supervision of various shifts.

355
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,552
[SPEAKER_07]: reports to the assistant superintendent for enrichment, innovation and operations.

356
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Job description has been reviewed and approved.

357
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:52,195
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, I'm not going to read everything verbatim.

358
00:56:52,835 --> 00:57:10,784
[SPEAKER_07]: The next part I do want to really go through, though, and make sure in summary that the facilities director is responsible as a management level position for eight schools across seven buildings comprising approximately 1.2 million square feet of academic science lab, athletic and performing arts space.

359
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:16,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's responsible for maintaining the best possible conditions for all staff and students.

360
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:22,570
[SPEAKER_07]: These spaces and their condition are critical to the academic and extracurricular success of our state admission.

361
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:31,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to be very clear about that, is that as I work through these job descriptions, they aren't standing alone as managing space.

362
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:33,579
[SPEAKER_07]: They're standing in concert

363
00:57:33,962 --> 00:57:47,750
[SPEAKER_07]: with making sure that our academic and extracurricular environment has what it needs so that we can produce the best out it the best stated outcomes for our students and be a flagship district for the Commonwealth.

364
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:55,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So the facilities director is directly responsible for the following staff members are maintenance staff and administrative assistant.

365
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:02,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And Assistant Facilities Director, which is listed as tentative right now, simply because the other has not been approved.

366
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Facilities Director is responsible for the indirect supervision of the following staff members, and that's our custodial crew.

367
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:15,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are under the direct supervision in the Assistant Facilities Director position.

368
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:35,079
[SPEAKER_07]: The facilities director is responsible for developing both short and long-term practices for preventative, corrective, and predictive maintenance, and the facilities director needs to identify innovative ways in which the department can improve functionality and will utilize existing district systems and strong organizational skills to assign work to staff members.

369
00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:51,595
[SPEAKER_07]: qualifications in researching this, a minimum of possessing a bachelor's degree from an accredited four-year college or university in one of the following fields, facilities management, civil engineering, construction management, or a closely related field.

370
00:58:52,016 --> 00:59:00,700
[SPEAKER_07]: However, in working with our owners project managers and other engineering firms, well specifically B2Q on the HVAC process,

371
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:15,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Master's degree would definitely be preferred as we move forward with complex building systems, especially thinking about the potential of an updated or new Medford High School that will come through a feasibility study.

372
00:59:16,337 --> 00:59:19,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior experience working with MSBA would be preferred.

373
00:59:19,078 --> 00:59:26,321
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not just for the immediate situation, but for statements of interest moving forward in years in the future.

374
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:54,703
[SPEAKER_07]: a minimum of five years related experience with two years supervising staff, experience analyzing problems, budgeting, developing action plans, knowledge of practices related to fiscal management, and to make sure that we have a working knowledge of OSHA, EPA requirements, as well as the Massachusetts Building Codes, and an ability to work collaboratively, to be on call.

375
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:56,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham was able to offer

376
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:15,302
[SPEAKER_07]: a comment on that, um, and to be able to really make sure that they are available as situations present themselves, which in 1.2 million square feet of office space, I'm sorry of academic and extracurricular spaces happens frequently.

377
01:00:16,643 --> 01:00:16,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

378
01:00:17,832 --> 01:00:26,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And the essential functions are to oversee and direct the daily operations of the facilities department, lead departmental personnel in collaboration with principals.

379
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:42,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, bringing it back to that academic focus and include the providing annual professional development and training where members establish a vision of, um, vision for the department that provides functionality in existing facilities.

380
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:52,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Manage annual service contract processes, which we're really looking at preventative maintenance in this area, but also cleaning contracts.

381
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:56,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Review and approve all invoices upon verification that the work has been completed.

382
01:00:57,648 --> 01:01:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Develop and execute an annual departmental budget.

383
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Review plan specifications permitting cost estimates for district projects.

384
01:01:06,112 --> 01:01:09,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Confirm all district systems are adequately and properly maintained.

385
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:12,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And so providing examples here.

386
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:20,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Ensure district landscaping facilities are well maintained, presentable and available to students, athletes and residents in an environmentally conscious manner.

387
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:26,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Build and administer an equipment and vehicle plan that includes acquisition, maintenance and replacement.

388
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:45,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Mackenzie and establish a weather mitigation plan to really look at the we put it forward a heat protocol to this committee to make sure that that is inclusive of snow and advice to the superintendent of schools as needed.

389
01:01:46,047 --> 01:02:13,009
[SPEAKER_07]: maintain strong working relationships with city department heads and vendors, participate in the collective bargaining process, and administer all contracts involving facilities department staff, assist in the, that is, believe it or not, that staff represents three separate bargaining units, assist in the negotiation and implementation of district facility leases with renters of all our facilities, engage with students, staff, school committee, board, and general public,

390
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:24,946
[SPEAKER_07]: in a manner that is professionally engaging and responsive to the suggestions in these that are presented, and to create an energy management plan that reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

391
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:30,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the physical requirements are pro forma around lifting 50 pounds,

392
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:40,762
[SPEAKER_07]: available to move freely within schools, offices and all district spaces, ability to flex hours to support the needs of the district as situations arise.

393
01:02:40,902 --> 01:03:00,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And then additional requirements, attend school committee meetings when requested, manages the AHERA plan, which is our asbestos maintenance plan, integrated pest management, elaborating on district safety plan, and all permits for work through the Medford Building Inspector, and perform additional duties as assigned by the assistant superintendent.

394
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

395
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:12,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions or comments or amendments or adjustments or motions?

396
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

397
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:21,744
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I think we should have a new rule that you should have to have a baby or a toddler on your lap for any meeting where we discuss something like this.

398
01:03:23,027 --> 01:03:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty dry.

399
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:37,963
[SPEAKER_09]: But in all seriousness, in keeping with what Vice Chair Graham mentioned, I've been working on policy formats and all this other stuff, and I just realized that we probably should have a similar kind of

400
01:03:39,204 --> 01:03:45,689
[SPEAKER_09]: section on job descriptions so that we know in the future when the job description was approved or amended.

401
01:03:46,689 --> 01:04:00,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't feel like I have anything to actually add to it, but if the committee is fine, I will just draft something to be added to those that would be very similar to our policy format that we've been using.

402
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:05,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't need to be a motion unless somebody just thinks that's a bad idea for some reason.

403
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

404
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:13,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, so I did.

405
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:25,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop a couple of changes into the document that you saw in red line, but the 1 I wanted to call out was this the bullet under.

406
01:04:28,293 --> 01:04:34,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Under 1st, section qualifications, or it should be available in an on call manner 24 hours per day.

407
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:34,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I.

408
01:04:38,715 --> 01:04:41,657
[SPEAKER_03]: My fear is that nobody will want this job.

409
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So my suggestion is that we instead say be available to promptly address planned and unplanned needs across school property.

410
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:56,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to pop that in the chat if everyone is okay with that.

411
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's probably slightly better language.

412
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:07,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I'm just looking to see if there were any other, um, questions or comments.

413
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:15,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I had, I did have a comment also under essential functions where we say, um, manage the annual service contract process.

414
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:28,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know that we are trying to implement service contract, like preventative maintenance service contracts that will be managed by this team, but we also have a contract cleaning service and my suggestion, um,

415
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:43,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for Dr. Cushing to separate those two things out so they are different line items because they're completely different kinds of work, in my opinion.

416
01:05:44,165 --> 01:05:53,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Managing a contract cleaner, I know there's a contracting piece of that, but that's about day-to-day, daily, nightly performance.

417
01:05:54,852 --> 01:06:02,155
[SPEAKER_03]: of the contract cleaner versus like the monthly pest control folks or, or whatever those other, um, maintenance contracts will be.

418
01:06:04,076 --> 01:06:05,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So those would be my two suggestions.

419
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I'd be happy to make a motion to approve as amended unless there are other questions.

420
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:12,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

421
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:14,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

422
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:20,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really see any, uh, distinctions at the moment that I would change, although I would.

423
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:34,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, with respect to vice chair Graham push a little bit back on the on call manner, because as someone who has served in on call capacities before, I feel like being pretty blunt about the demand is almost better to, like, have it outright.

424
01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:39,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I understand the appeal and trying to make sure that it's phrased in a way.

425
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,663
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, I think something about, you know, just general on call support.

426
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:49,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, maybe, maybe don't say 24 hours a day, because that I mean, it's kind of just implied with the phrase on call support.

427
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:49,708
[SPEAKER_08]: But

428
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:57,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I think being very, very blunt with that maybe, in my opinion, I think is a better course.

429
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you like to sever that amendment?

430
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:10,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if we could sever that amendment, that'd be great.

431
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:20,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean, I'm also I'm also open to amending the amendment and just saying, to just be available in an on call support manner throughout the year.

432
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:24,271
[SPEAKER_08]: as opposed to in an on-call manner, 24 hours a day throughout the year.

433
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Amber Graham, thoughts?

434
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in the middle maybe might work.

435
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're sort of splitting hairs here.

436
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:47,029
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a management level position and people applying for these kinds of positions understand that they are expected to be available.

437
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if we said be available

438
01:07:50,432 --> 01:07:54,633
[SPEAKER_03]: for on-call support and to promptly address planned and unplanned needs.

439
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I just am trying to get away from 24 hours a day, seven days a week language.

440
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the part that, like, if I was reading that as an applicant, what I would be worried about is how many people work for this place?

441
01:08:06,997 --> 01:08:09,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I going to be called to do every last little thing that goes wrong?

442
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:14,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a lot of variability in there.

443
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like maybe if we merge the two together, we'll get to the spirit of that.

444
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:21,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, that works for me.

445
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what I'm trying to imply.

446
01:08:23,485 --> 01:08:30,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I was just held up on using the on-call support language and keeping that consistent.

447
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, no, that works for me.

448
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:33,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It works for you.

449
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:34,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting it in the chat.

450
01:08:36,935 --> 01:08:42,259
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, motion for approval of my memogram as amended and then adjusted with another amendment.

451
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:46,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Reinfeld has her hand up again.

452
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:47,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, gosh, yeah.

453
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld, sorry.

454
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It does blend in with your background.

455
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:54,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll switch to the default yellow instead of my accurate skin tone.

456
01:08:56,617 --> 01:09:02,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you clarify what the role is in terms of special projects?

457
01:09:02,984 --> 01:09:12,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's mention of maintaining the capital plan and relationships with vendors, but when we approved the assistance

458
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities director as part of the override allocation.

459
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:32,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the motivation for that was we knew that the district was going to be entering into a number of special projects, not just the new high school, but with the capital plan that we have approved as a committee, we know there are going to be select projects.

460
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned HVAC, but we know that's not the only one.

461
01:09:35,164 --> 01:09:37,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there are things coming up and

462
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:55,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, maybe it's a bullet point just on special projects, but I wasn't sure exactly is it the facilities manager, is it the assistant facilities manager who's going to be serving as the liaison to the vendor, the OPM, the project manager.

463
01:09:56,245 --> 01:10:14,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if that is an explicit responsibility of being the point of contact or the team lead within the district for these new construction projects, these big maintenance projects, not just ongoing maintenance, I think that needs to be called out more clearly in one or both of the job descriptions.

464
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:17,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wasn't quite sure which one that was landing on.

465
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thoughts, thank you.

466
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld, so is that a motion to amend

467
01:10:26,015 --> 01:10:28,856
[SPEAKER_04]: into which job description should a bullet point?

468
01:10:30,377 --> 01:10:32,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely in the new one, I would believe.

469
01:10:32,037 --> 01:10:35,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Or both.

470
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, are they both?

471
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:44,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it at the discretion of the facilities director to delegate that to an assistant facilities person?

472
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:46,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was a vision.

473
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:48,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

474
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:52,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see that reflected in one or both of these descriptions.

475
01:10:54,174 --> 01:10:55,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I agree.

476
01:10:55,646 --> 01:10:56,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

477
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:19,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the facilities director is our liaison for MSBA today, and I would expect that that would continue to be true, particularly because the facilities director in this, like, two-prong process, the facilities director has responsibility over the maintenance staff directly versus the custodial staff will sit with the assistant director.

478
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:26,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think, like, that special projects piece belongs in the facilities director, and I would also say

479
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:49,206
[SPEAKER_03]: just as a matter of like good form for job descriptions, it would also say other job-related responsibilities as assigned so that it's clear that this is not like a finite list of what could happen in the job as time goes on.

480
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:52,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would be happy to add those two amendments.

481
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:55,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

482
01:11:57,664 --> 01:12:02,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval as amended by, is there a motion for approval?

483
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:04,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

484
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham, as amended, seconded by?

485
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

486
01:12:09,054 --> 01:12:09,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Intoppa.

487
01:12:12,858 --> 01:12:13,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

488
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley.

489
01:12:18,703 --> 01:12:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

490
01:12:20,164 --> 01:12:20,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

491
01:12:21,225 --> 01:12:21,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

492
01:12:22,206 --> 01:12:22,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Intoppa.

493
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:23,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

494
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:24,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olipate.

495
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:25,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

496
01:12:26,314 --> 01:12:26,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld.

497
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:27,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

498
01:12:28,254 --> 01:12:28,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rossell.

499
01:12:28,755 --> 01:12:28,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

500
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:29,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

501
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

502
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

503
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:34,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes as amended.

504
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:42,382
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's no other amendments to either job description, I'll go on to number three.

505
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:53,045
[SPEAKER_02]: vocational presentation to adjust for MSBA, Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent, and Mr. Chad Fallon, director, principal of Medford Vocational Technical High School.

506
01:12:53,785 --> 01:12:54,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

507
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to interject.

508
01:12:58,426 --> 01:13:01,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we, were just both approved or was just one?

509
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:03,587
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I just wanted to follow up on that.

510
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was, I was just going to be my responsibility director.

511
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let's back up, sorry.

512
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:13,428
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, my apologies.

513
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:21,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so is there a motion for approval or any questions or amendments to the assistant facilities director position?

514
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:23,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

515
01:13:24,774 --> 01:13:28,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a couple of suggestions on this one as well.

516
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:39,382
[SPEAKER_03]: In the section, sorry, I'm just looking for it.

517
01:13:51,526 --> 01:14:07,494
[SPEAKER_03]: In the essential functions section, there's a bullet about halfway down this is assist in the construction of weather mitigation plans, including snow and ice operations that account for equipment personnel training and materials.

518
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:10,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the word.

519
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be assist in the development of a weather mitigation plan.

520
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:23,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would also suggest that there be another sentence added to that that says, like.

521
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:25,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about.

522
01:14:26,957 --> 01:14:34,040
[SPEAKER_03]: enacting the weather mitigation plans as appropriate, like, when needed, right?

523
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:39,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 1 thing to have an overarching plan that says this is how we're going to handle these events.

524
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:45,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when events happen, we have to actually do the thing that we put in the plan.

525
01:14:45,704 --> 01:14:47,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just clarify that.

526
01:14:57,287 --> 01:15:09,811
[SPEAKER_03]: The other change is the same language about the 24-7 language, which Dr. Cushing may have already gotten.

527
01:15:13,912 --> 01:15:14,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

528
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:15,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

529
01:15:15,892 --> 01:15:21,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

530
01:15:33,684 --> 01:15:37,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to make a motion to approve unless my colleagues have other questions.

531
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:40,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval.

532
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld.

533
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:46,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this another other duties as assigned needed here?

534
01:15:47,947 --> 01:15:48,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

535
01:15:48,568 --> 01:15:53,829
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that this is going to grow or evolve, maybe not.

536
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Just I do have that under additional requirements.

537
01:15:57,906 --> 01:16:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps it would be best if we merge additional requirements just in, but it is perform additional duties as assigned by the facilities director.

538
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:14,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I did in this was I took the direct reporting responsibility away from my current title and moved it to be nested under the facilities director.

539
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:22,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And then assist with collective bargaining and administer all contracts involving the facilities department staff.

540
01:16:23,088 --> 01:16:26,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really just the custodians versus?

541
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:31,171
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be.

542
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: If this person is responsible for the custodians and not other management, I'm not sure it's appropriate to be administering contracts not related to custodial.

543
01:16:47,517 --> 01:16:48,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You tell me how that works.

544
01:16:49,478 --> 01:17:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this would be more of a team approach for all the collective bargaining and would want to make sure that the person, whoever is the successful candidate would have the opportunity to observe and grow and contribute to.

545
01:17:02,507 --> 01:17:10,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's assist with collective bargaining and administration of all contracts of rather than the administer verb.

546
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:11,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is.

547
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:22,169
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit semantic, but this person is not responsible for fully to administer it, to assist and administer.

548
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They're assisting with the bargaining and administration.

549
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

550
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:36,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Just if I... Dr. Cushing, did you just... Yes.

551
01:17:36,775 --> 01:17:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are you all set?

552
01:17:38,016 --> 01:17:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you're working on it.

553
01:17:39,616 --> 01:17:41,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're gonna go to member Rousseau, then member Graham.

554
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:44,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

555
01:17:45,015 --> 01:17:52,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to implore my dear colleagues to have written up language when you want to change stuff.

556
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:55,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard to write amendments to a full document.

557
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't write the whole document over into the minutes.

558
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:00,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that it's

559
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:03,551
[SPEAKER_09]: how this is, I do this too myself.

560
01:18:03,651 --> 01:18:10,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not scolding anyone, but trying to figure out how to write this so that it can actually become part of the minutes is a very big challenge.

561
01:18:11,035 --> 01:18:13,497
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you have thoughts on a sentence?

562
01:18:14,037 --> 01:18:15,478
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the new sentence look like?

563
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:17,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be greatly appreciated.

564
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:18,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

565
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Rizzo.

566
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:21,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

567
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to make a motion to approve if there are no other comments.

568
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve by Member Graham as amended, seconded by?

569
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

570
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:38,621

01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:45,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:18:46,483 --> 01:18:47,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Intoppa?

577
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:48,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade?

579
01:18:50,124 --> 01:18:50,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

580
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:52,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

581
01:18:52,905 --> 01:18:53,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

582
01:18:53,845 --> 01:18:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

583
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:54,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

584
01:18:54,706 --> 01:18:55,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

585
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:56,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

586
01:18:56,206 --> 01:18:57,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

587
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:58,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper passes.

588
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:03,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

589
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:11,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Under continued business, we have second meeting member Graham.

590
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,593
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do number three.

591
01:19:14,014 --> 01:19:14,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we missed a question.

592
01:19:15,654 --> 01:19:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Vocational presentation to adjust for MSBA.

593
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:22,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of schools.

594
01:19:23,411 --> 01:19:25,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Chad Fallon, that's right.

595
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:25,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

596
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long week.

597
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:30,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Director of Medford Vocational Technical High School.

598
01:19:31,118 --> 01:19:31,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I already read that.

599
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:32,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

600
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the committee once again.

601
01:19:35,922 --> 01:19:41,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we wanted to do was take a moment here today to simply update you.

602
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:44,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Much of this slide deck will not be presented tonight.

603
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:59,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to take a moment to have Director Fallon speak on this slide and the next slide as we also discuss the approvals that were made and voted into record on May 20th of 2024.

604
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:17,124
[SPEAKER_07]: for expanding the CTE programs at Medford High School and asking and requesting of the committee, and I'll get into it later, but a vote to actually reduce that from five programs to four based on conversations we've had.

605
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:22,206
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this time I'd like to hand it over for these next two slides for Director Fallon.

606
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:25,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

607
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:26,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to provide an update.

608
01:20:26,858 --> 01:20:31,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time we met about MSBA, we didn't have the 24-25 school year placement data.

609
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do now.

610
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:35,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give a quick update.

611
01:20:35,162 --> 01:20:38,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a much better place as far as a wait list goes than we were in previous years.

612
01:20:38,923 --> 01:20:45,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is due in part to the additional teaching staff in three of our programs due to the override.

613
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:49,628
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to increase seats by about five to six students in each of those programs.

614
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:53,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a total of 18 students right now that are on a wait list.

615
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:58,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Those 18 students haven't received any choice of our CareerTech programs.

616
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:04,312
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several students that are on waitlists for additional programs or maybe students that didn't get their first and second choice.

617
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,833
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, the waitlist stands at 18.

618
01:21:07,573 --> 01:21:22,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we look at new programs in the future for the new building, we do believe that we're going to really be able to close this gap and not have any students on a waitlist so that every student at least gets a program of their choice, whether it be their first, second or third.

619
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,682
[SPEAKER_01]: For this year, we had 271 students complete the CTE exploratory.

620
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:32,183
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 of them were placed.

621
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,264
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the difference from last year to this year.

622
01:21:35,065 --> 01:21:40,788
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, 18 have been waitlisted and 53 of those students chose a traditional high school pathway.

623
01:21:42,008 --> 01:21:46,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, we're going to be going to a model that all freshmen

624
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:55,640
[SPEAKER_01]: will be able to participate in Freshman Exploratory, which will include an art rotation, a music rotation, and a technology rotation.

625
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also going to build in a freshman seminar rotation into that plan.

626
01:22:03,262 --> 01:22:04,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Director Fallon.

627
01:22:04,643 --> 01:22:13,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So our current program, as the committee is well aware, is 15 Massachusetts Byron Elementary and Secondary Education, Chapter 74, Approved Career and Technical Education.

628
01:22:14,473 --> 01:22:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: vocational programs.

629
01:22:15,994 --> 01:22:22,998
[SPEAKER_07]: We are trying to make sure that everyone moves away from, you know, VOC and really thinks about career technical education or CTE.

630
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:29,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And five programs currently approved by the Medford School Committee referencing that May 20th vote that I mentioned earlier.

631
01:22:30,462 --> 01:22:37,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So the approved new programming that can launch in the current facility and does not require new space.

632
01:22:37,946 --> 01:22:44,109
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, our IT networking that we will look to go through the DESE application submission next school year.

633
01:22:45,003 --> 01:23:08,393
[SPEAKER_07]: um and the uh launch the exploratory in 26 and 27 and then criminal justice which is a which is a narrow title for a very expansive field um but looking for destiny destiny application submission more than likely in all honesty for us to start this work next year as well um i want to make sure that everything is tied tightly

634
01:23:09,073 --> 01:23:18,719
[SPEAKER_07]: to the MSBA feasibility process, and we don't miss a window because a program has not been approved by DESE.

635
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:24,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So criminal justice, hopefully to launch the exploratory in the 27-28 school year.

636
01:23:27,124 --> 01:23:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: as you see there.

637
01:23:28,405 --> 01:23:31,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Proven new programming that the committee approved last year.

638
01:23:31,767 --> 01:23:36,751
[SPEAKER_07]: However, this is really connected to the MSBA process and would require new space.

639
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:43,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have the space available at this time to open these shops or to run these exploratories.

640
01:23:44,216 --> 01:23:47,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And so those would be dental assisting and plumbing.

641
01:23:49,015 --> 01:23:56,865
[SPEAKER_07]: and looking at DESE application work to commence next year as well, hopefully again to align with that feasibility work.

642
01:23:57,605 --> 01:24:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: What we are here tonight really, though, to ask for is the approval of one of the approved new programs, and that's veterinary science.

643
01:24:06,392 --> 01:24:11,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a conversation, and as you see here, school committee approved May 2024.

644
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: We, as MPS leadership, are seeking to remove it at this time based on further conversations and investigation.

645
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:23,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Director Fallon, feel free to jump in at any point.

646
01:24:23,753 --> 01:24:31,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But as part of our eligibility phase, we met with DESE regarding proposed expansion plans for Chapter 74 programs.

647
01:24:31,657 --> 01:24:35,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And DESE highlighted the significant commitments to launch this program.

648
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:43,643
[SPEAKER_07]: District and school leadership is again seeking a vote of the school committee to remove veterinary science from our Chapter 74 submission form.

649
01:24:44,364 --> 01:24:50,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And Director Fallon, would you like to speak about the rationale for removal as is bulleted on the screen?

650
01:24:52,803 --> 01:25:04,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So in speaking with other schools, and as Dr. Cushing said, speaking with the Department of Education directly, there is more to this program than just the day-to-day operations.

651
01:25:04,686 --> 01:25:07,186
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a significant upkeep requirement.

652
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:11,327
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have 24-hour care for the animals that you have in your care.

653
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:13,208
[SPEAKER_01]: There's additional certifications.

654
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:21,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost feel like the agricultural schools really do a good job at this because they have the space and they have

655
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:32,612
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to do this, we just are thinking that based on the information we received and all of these factors, probably is not the best move for Medford at this time.

656
01:25:37,357 --> 01:25:45,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the remainder of the slide deck has been basically maintained from May 2024 for new programs and updating.

657
01:25:45,963 --> 01:25:57,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not see the need, unless the committee feels it is necessary, to go through that presentation, the remainder of the presentation at this time, as what we're seeking is the removal of veterinary science.

658
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:05,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham?

659
01:26:11,036 --> 01:26:12,877
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're on mute.

660
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:23,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I just wanted to thank Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing and Dr. Glusi for hopping on the phone with Jesse.

661
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:32,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty standard part of the MSBA process where, because we had chapter 74 programs, and we were talking about expansion.

662
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:43,736
[SPEAKER_03]: MSBA passes our paperwork essentially over to DESE and then it's pretty standard part of the process where they meet and say, what are you thinking?

663
01:26:43,856 --> 01:26:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening?

664
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:45,377
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens next?

665
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:46,177
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of thing.

666
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:47,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where this conversation happened.

667
01:26:48,018 --> 01:26:51,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a pretty routine part of the process.

668
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:55,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We will need to take a vote tonight so that I can pass that back to MSBA.

669
01:26:56,763 --> 01:27:01,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Chapter 74 form can be updated, which Dr. Cushing and I will handle.

670
01:27:03,007 --> 01:27:08,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to say, like, I think this is exactly what the process is supposed to do.

671
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to say, like, explore, think about the things that you want to know more about.

672
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:17,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you sort of triangulate it and fine-tune.

673
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a sister who is a vet, and I was like, oh, veterinary science sounds like a thing that could happen without lots and lots of animals at this stage, like in these early stages.

674
01:27:32,191 --> 01:27:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we talked to Desi, they were like, no, no, you need to have animals.

675
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, OK, that's really not where we're at right now.

676
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:54,242
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, the process was very smooth, DESI was very collaborative, they were excited about the other expansions that we talked about and I have a motion when people are done with their questions.

677
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you member Graham.

678
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

679
01:28:00,717 --> 01:28:05,300
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, what is their specific language that program through that in the last minute.

680
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did, I did.

681
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:09,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will put it in the chat.

682
01:28:09,543 --> 01:28:12,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not the right language.

683
01:28:13,806 --> 01:28:14,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

684
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:19,249
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is to

685
01:28:20,743 --> 01:28:33,147
[SPEAKER_03]: remove veterinary science from exploration and adjust the expansion timelines for dental assisting criminal justice, protective services, plumbing, HVAC and information systems per the presentation.

686
01:28:33,987 --> 01:28:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just put that in the chat.

687
01:28:38,009 --> 01:28:47,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's, so basically because we sent this initial presentation to MSBA, we will have to make, send them the update and be able to clarify for them what changes happened.

688
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:48,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And this motion will do that.

689
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:51,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you, Member Graham.

690
01:28:51,821 --> 01:28:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally bummed about the veterinary program.

691
01:28:55,384 --> 01:28:56,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been great for our students.

692
01:28:56,986 --> 01:29:02,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's always a wait list for Essex Tech, but completely understand that it's unfeasible.

693
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we learned that now before we got anybody's hopes up.

694
01:29:06,754 --> 01:29:10,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by... I'll second that.

695
01:29:11,898 --> 01:29:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, roll call, please.

696
01:29:15,081 --> 01:29:15,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley.

697
01:29:16,922 --> 01:29:17,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

698
01:29:18,184 --> 01:29:18,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

699
01:29:20,138 --> 01:29:20,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

700
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:20,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

701
01:29:20,539 --> 01:29:20,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

702
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:21,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

703
01:29:38,477 --> 01:29:41,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any presentations of the public, but we do have continued business.

704
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:47,032
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our second reading of the Medford High School graduation and competency determination requirements.

705
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:51,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galusi, our intern superintendent.

706
01:29:54,735 --> 01:29:55,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, good evening.

707
01:29:55,895 --> 01:30:17,884
[SPEAKER_12]: As previously presented during the last school committee meeting, we put forward a proposed language to update the IKF policy regarding the requirements for high school graduation and the state and legal needs to have a competency determination measure.

708
01:30:18,424 --> 01:30:23,507
[SPEAKER_12]: as a result of the passing of ballot question number two.

709
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:29,209
[SPEAKER_12]: So here with just a few tweaks, but is the second reading for that policy.

710
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:39,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I do kind of yield to the committee if you would like me to read this again or how I should proceed.

711
01:30:40,655 --> 01:30:42,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we waive the second reading on motion?

712
01:30:44,777 --> 01:30:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to waive the second reading by member Branley.

713
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:49,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

714
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I can read it.

715
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

716
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:00,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham doesn't want to hear my voice for that long.

717
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of policies to read tonight, so.

718
01:31:03,612 --> 01:31:06,713

[SPEAKER_02]: It's a second reading.

01:32:20,996 --> 01:32:23,177
[SPEAKER_02]: First reading was on 12-2, 2024.

761
01:32:23,617 --> 01:32:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: ADFW water wellness policy.

762
01:32:26,259 --> 01:32:32,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Public Schools is committed to the health and safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and community partners.

763
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, the Medford Public Schools commits to providing safe drinkable water for consumption district-wide.

764
01:32:37,757 --> 01:32:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to waive the full reading?

765
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:42,299
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of numbers.

766
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:42,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

767
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to waive the full reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by?

768
01:32:46,701 --> 01:32:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

769
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

01:32:54,865 --> 01:32:56,065
[SPEAKER_02]: She did.

774
01:32:59,066 --> 01:32:59,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Bradley.

775
01:33:00,707 --> 01:33:02,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the change on this was,

776
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:06,093
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing the waiving the reading roll call right now.

777
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:06,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

778
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,074

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

782
01:33:12,335 --> 01:33:13,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ntukapa?

783
01:33:13,515 --> 01:33:13,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

784
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:15,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade?

785
01:33:15,676 --> 01:33:15,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

786
01:33:16,977 --> 01:33:17,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

787
01:33:18,017 --> 01:33:18,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

788
01:33:19,457 --> 01:33:20,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, yes.

789
01:33:20,618 --> 01:33:21,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mayor Langocourt?

790
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:23,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

791
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:24,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

792
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:26,840
[SPEAKER_02]: The reading was waived.

793
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want drinkable water.

794
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We've recently learned, if I may, from the chair that changing out the faucets, and Dr. Cushing can further elaborate, but the good news is that changing out the faucets did alleviate a lot of our problems.

795
01:33:45,004 --> 01:33:48,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is very good news and we will continue working through that.

796
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:56,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we got that update from Paul Riggie, our city side facilities director that's helping the schools.

797
01:33:57,964 --> 01:34:03,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion for approval, if Dr. Cushing doesn't want anything, for the second reading of this policy?

798
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:06,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I motion to approve.

799
01:34:06,695 --> 01:34:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade, seconded by?

800
01:34:09,299 --> 01:34:11,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just interject one thing, actually, on this?

801
01:34:12,483 --> 01:34:34,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that from the water presentation that we had earlier this year by members of DEP, and I apologize, mixing up acronyms, I believe they were reducing it from 15 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion, if I remember correctly, which narrows the field.

802
01:34:40,117 --> 01:34:40,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

803
01:34:43,715 --> 01:34:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Member Intoppa.

804
01:34:46,076 --> 01:34:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

805
01:34:46,536 --> 01:34:53,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I believe that was the talk that we had back in December when this is originally put that it would be bringing down from 10 to 15.

806
01:34:54,498 --> 01:35:00,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also know Member Reinfeld had a comment, and this may be her comment about that number being changed.

807
01:35:00,339 --> 01:35:10,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm open to amending and would encourage an amendment, actually motion to amend, to go from where it states lead results to go from

808
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:22,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime 15 is mentioned to go to 10 parts per billion, because it looks like looking at Google and you know, whatever comes up, like according to mass.gov, it's still 15 parts per billion.

809
01:35:22,653 --> 01:35:28,354
[SPEAKER_08]: But if that's in progress, and we can be progressive about it and get ahead of the game, so we don't have to revisit this and then say it's actually 10.

810
01:35:28,914 --> 01:35:30,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more than happy to amend the motion.

811
01:35:30,354 --> 01:35:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way it actually reads as 10 instead of 15.

812
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:42,682
[SPEAKER_02]: motion for approval by Member Olapade but amended by Member Intoppa.

813
01:35:44,382 --> 01:35:45,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

814
01:35:50,165 --> 01:35:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I can second.

815
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:52,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley.

816
01:35:53,626 --> 01:35:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

817
01:35:55,767 --> 01:35:56,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley.

818
01:35:57,448 --> 01:35:57,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

819
01:35:57,628 --> 01:35:58,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I am.

820
01:35:59,069 --> 01:35:59,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm not muted.

821
01:35:59,969 --> 01:36:01,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

822
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:01,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

823
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

824
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:04,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Intoppa.

825
01:36:05,117 --> 01:36:05,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

826
01:36:06,198 --> 01:36:06,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade.

827
01:36:08,259 --> 01:36:08,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

828
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:09,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld.

829
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:10,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

830
01:36:11,861 --> 01:36:12,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rosetti.

831
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:12,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

832
01:36:12,761 --> 01:36:13,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lengelker.

833
01:36:14,162 --> 01:36:14,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

834
01:36:14,422 --> 01:36:15,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

835
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Second reading is passed.

836
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:25,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Under new business, we have 2025-07 offered by Member Olapade and Member Reinfeld.

837
01:36:25,828 --> 01:36:30,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolution in support of MPS's LGBTQIA plus community.

838
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:33,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford School Committee affirms the Medford Public Schools commitment

839
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:39,876
[SPEAKER_02]: to protecting the safety, dignity, and educational rights of our queer and gender non-conforming community members.

840
01:36:40,517 --> 01:36:56,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We recognize and celebrate the unique qualities and potential that each of these individuals brings to our community and reject any efforts to erase, denigrate, or weaponize their identities as a direct affront to the values and practices of member public schools.

841
01:36:56,988 --> 01:37:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We remain committed to upholding the non-discrimination principles and protocols outlined in Mass General Laws, Chapter 76, Section 5, and Chapter 662, Medford Public Schools policies AC, ACA1, ACE, ACA-E, and JB, and all federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

842
01:37:21,552 --> 01:37:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: We also affirm students' and employees' right to privacy in accordance with the above

843
01:37:26,832 --> 01:37:28,613
[SPEAKER_02]: in other relevant state and federal laws.

844
01:37:28,953 --> 01:37:54,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved, the Metropolitan Public Schools shall continue all activities and initiatives to ensure a healthy and welcoming school environment for our queer, questioning, and gender nonconforming community members in and beyond the classroom, included but not limited to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual students, teachers, and staff, including but not limited to transgender, nonbinary, genderfluid, and intersex students, teachers, and staff.

845
01:37:58,356 --> 01:37:58,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor.

846
01:37:59,056 --> 01:38:00,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I can speak on this.

847
01:38:01,078 --> 01:38:01,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

848
01:38:01,638 --> 01:38:05,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks to my colleagues for considering these resolutions, right?

849
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Our job is of course to set policy and this resolution isn't setting policy.

850
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simply affirming the existing policy and directs the superintendent to continue existing practices.

851
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to talk very, very, as briefly as I can about why this is on the agenda, particularly since it echoes the guidance that Dr. Galusi has already sent to district staff.

852
01:38:26,933 --> 01:38:32,736
[SPEAKER_04]: and a statement that the Acting Commissioner of Education for Massachusetts put out a few weeks ago.

853
01:38:33,496 --> 01:38:50,684
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on the agenda in partly in response to concerns from students, teachers, some students' families wondering whether things like our GSAs and respectful pronoun use and language in academic and administrative forms and protection from bullying and harassment are going away

854
01:38:51,224 --> 01:38:54,527
[SPEAKER_04]: in light of the political climate, just want to say, no, they're not.

855
01:38:55,187 --> 01:39:07,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But also this is on the agenda because there is a pattern in history and in communities more broadly of using marginalized populations as a test balloon for trampling of individual rights.

856
01:39:07,856 --> 01:39:18,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't need to dwell on that, but I think this is why I, or really we felt that this was important to draw a line now and state this publicly.

857
01:39:19,725 --> 01:39:31,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also just wanted to note that we did separate out sexual orientation from gender identity because there are different risks, vulnerabilities, really, that come with those different identities.

858
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's worth acknowledging.

859
01:39:34,793 --> 01:39:36,094
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, this is about

860
01:39:36,848 --> 01:39:42,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Belonging right learning does not happen unless people feel safe and safety requires a sense of belonging.

861
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I, I think we do have a few students on the call.

862
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:52,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there may be some people watching on YouTube and just to say, we celebrate you.

863
01:39:52,805 --> 01:39:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate you.

864
01:39:54,847 --> 01:39:57,230
[SPEAKER_04]: and everyone belongs in the Medford public schools.

865
01:39:58,090 --> 01:40:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of language changes I would like to put questioning back into that first sentence.

866
01:40:04,477 --> 01:40:09,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And we missed a couple of the policies around harassment and retaliation.

867
01:40:10,823 --> 01:40:16,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so just to add those to the list of MPS policies, but these exist, these laws have not changed.

868
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:25,521
[SPEAKER_04]: We welcome our queer and gender nonconforming students and staff, families, and I think it's worth saying publicly here and now.

869
01:40:27,304 --> 01:40:29,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade, I don't know if you wanted to add to that.

870
01:40:30,388 --> 01:40:31,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you Member Reinfeld.

871
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade?

872
01:40:33,049 --> 01:40:33,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

873
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:35,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

874
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:36,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to echo what Member Reinfeld said.

875
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:44,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very much a similar decision as the one we made back in January in the 27th January meeting.

876
01:40:45,153 --> 01:40:46,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was 2025-2.

877
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:52,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a reaffirmation of an already standing set of expectations in our district.

878
01:40:52,915 --> 01:40:53,956
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not changing policy.

879
01:40:54,016 --> 01:41:00,178
[SPEAKER_06]: These things are already instituted, and we want to re-communicate that to the district and the greater community that we as an educational

880
01:41:01,378 --> 01:41:16,759
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, center want to reintegrate our commitment to our students and their families and the greater community that we want all people to feel comfortable and included no matter their, you know, regardless of their characteristic or their lived experience.

881
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:19,241
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that we all believe in, I think.

882
01:41:20,002 --> 01:41:24,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking as a generalization, I think there's a commitment here, especially from the federal government.

883
01:41:24,305 --> 01:41:32,572
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some pieces of rhetoric coming out of that government that are, I think, misaligned from what we as a district have committed to.

884
01:41:32,893 --> 01:41:34,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's why we want to put this forth.

885
01:41:34,374 --> 01:41:38,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, very much what I think Member Rodfield was trying to get at, and I'm in full agreement.

886
01:41:38,998 --> 01:41:40,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

887
01:41:43,241 --> 01:41:43,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Lucy?

888
01:41:45,271 --> 01:41:45,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

889
01:41:45,751 --> 01:41:56,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to be able to say thank you to Member Reinfeld and Member Olapade and also for mentioning the part about belonging.

890
01:41:56,180 --> 01:42:02,465
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a critical piece to our instructional vision for the Medford Public Schools District.

891
01:42:03,086 --> 01:42:09,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Member Reinfeld said, in order for students to learn, they have to feel safe.

892
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:10,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is

893
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:19,747
[SPEAKER_12]: at the core of our values and beliefs that students come to the door and they feel seen, heard, valued, and welcomed.

894
01:42:20,927 --> 01:42:24,208
[SPEAKER_12]: That also includes our staff.

895
01:42:25,549 --> 01:42:35,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to kind of just reiterate the positioning from Medford Public Schools and the support that we have with this policy.

896
01:42:37,753 --> 01:42:38,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Glusi.

897
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:50,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motion for approval by Member Reinfeld as amended in the two locations.

898
01:42:51,236 --> 01:42:51,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there were two?

899
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:52,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

900
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:53,637
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two.

901
01:42:53,657 --> 01:43:04,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to add the policy, additional policies under school policy, and then on the first paragraph, you wanted to add... I have the first paragraph.

902
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:05,701
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the second one?

903
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:07,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in the chat.

904
01:43:08,302 --> 01:43:10,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well then, I could always look at that.

905
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:16,278
[SPEAKER_04]: the ACAB policies and one of the JB policies.

906
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:19,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

907
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: This one has a language.

908
01:43:33,622 --> 01:43:33,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

909
01:43:33,982 --> 01:43:34,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

910
01:43:39,604 --> 01:43:40,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second this.

911
01:43:40,184 --> 01:43:41,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anybody else has.

912
01:43:45,228 --> 01:43:46,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, you're muted.

913
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:46,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

914
01:43:46,928 --> 01:43:47,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And then roll call, please.

915
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:51,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Bradley?

916
01:43:52,289 --> 01:43:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

917
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:54,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

918
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:54,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

919
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:56,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Tapa?

920
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

921
01:43:58,131 --> 01:43:58,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade?

922
01:43:59,331 --> 01:43:59,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

923
01:44:00,391 --> 01:44:01,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

924
01:44:01,571 --> 01:44:01,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

925
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:03,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, yes.

926
01:44:03,332 --> 01:44:03,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lango-Kern?

927
01:44:04,872 --> 01:44:05,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

928
01:44:05,512 --> 01:44:07,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

929
01:44:07,353 --> 01:44:08,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes as amended.

930
01:44:11,193 --> 01:44:13,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Member Olapade and Member Reinfeld

931
01:44:15,904 --> 01:44:27,115
[SPEAKER_02]: 2025-08, whereas federal and state level actions outside of Massachusetts have recently sought to limit educational practices, restrict local control, and suppress diverse perspectives in public schools across the nation.

932
01:44:27,656 --> 01:44:38,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford School Committee believes that education should empower students with the knowledge, critical thinking skills, and cultural awareness necessary to thrive in a diverse society and to contribute meaningfully to their communities.

933
01:44:39,455 --> 01:44:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas the Medford School Committee recognizes that a high quality education must respect and celebrate the abilities, needs, and potential of all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic status, religion, or language background.

934
01:44:55,778 --> 01:45:06,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, be it resolved, the Medford School Committee reaffirms its unwavering commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as foundational principles that inform all aspects of district policy, curriculum development,

935
01:45:07,575 --> 01:45:08,796
[SPEAKER_02]: and educational practice.

936
01:45:09,356 --> 01:45:29,133
[SPEAKER_02]: We have further resolved the Medford School Committee fully supports the district's use of robust and inclusive educational resources that accurately reflect and affirm the diverse lived experiences of our students and families, provide historically and culturally responsive curricula that honor the contributions and histories of all people, including historically marginalized communities.

937
01:45:30,042 --> 01:45:37,108
[SPEAKER_02]: equip students with the knowledge, skills, and global awareness necessary to engage in respectful dialogue, civic engagement, and lifelong learning.

938
01:45:38,029 --> 01:45:49,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved, the Medford School Committee strongly opposes any efforts to restrict or eliminate essential academic content, including history, art, science, literature, and health education on the basis of political ideology,

939
01:45:51,752 --> 01:45:54,753
[SPEAKER_02]: that seek to erase diverse voices and lived experiences.

940
01:45:55,633 --> 01:46:10,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved, the Medford School Committee unequivocally opposes the removal of resources, support systems, or accommodations for neurodiverse learners and students with disabilities, recognizing that access to an equitable and inclusive education is a fundamental right for all students.

941
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:19,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved, the Medford School Committee extends this commitment beyond the classroom, ensuring that extracurricular activities, afterschool programming,

942
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:26,767
[SPEAKER_02]: and school-sponsored initiatives remain inclusive and accessible to all students fostering leadership, creativity, and personal growth.

943
01:46:27,468 --> 01:46:32,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved, the Medford School Committee will not tolerate bullying, harassment, or intimidation.

944
01:46:33,027 --> 01:46:43,011
[SPEAKER_02]: whether from within or outside the district, particularly when such actions seek to undermine students' rights to a fair, comprehensive, and affirming education in a safe and welcoming environment.

945
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:56,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it finally resolved that the Medford School Committee remains steadfast in its mission to cultivate a school system that is inclusive, equitable, and empowering for all students, staff, and families, and will continue to advocate for policies and practices that advance these values.

946
01:46:59,178 --> 01:47:00,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion for approval?

947
01:47:02,969 --> 01:47:03,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval.

948
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:08,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember in Tapa seconded by second member Bramley.

949
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, please.

950
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:12,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olapade, did you?

951
01:47:13,918 --> 01:47:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: have your hand up.

952
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:16,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Say a quick comment about this.

953
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

954
01:47:17,241 --> 01:47:18,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

955
01:47:18,442 --> 01:47:22,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So this again is very much just reaffirm our commitment as a district to this.

956
01:47:22,585 --> 01:47:33,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there has been an increasing set of rhetoric and I would argue even weaponization of diversity, equity, inclusion efforts coming out of the federal government.

957
01:47:33,274 --> 01:47:35,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this, in my opinion, should be

958
01:47:36,517 --> 01:47:39,941
[SPEAKER_06]: removed from a political position or ideology.

959
01:47:40,341 --> 01:47:53,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we as people and professionals in this work have a responsibility to our students and their families and the greater community to reaffirm our commitment that we understand that DEI efforts are not used to undermine

960
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:55,861
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity.

961
01:47:57,062 --> 01:48:06,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're hearing is that this is used, these systems and these initiatives are being used to separate people when in reality it's intended to include people, right?

962
01:48:06,311 --> 01:48:07,572
[SPEAKER_06]: We're using inclusive language.

963
01:48:08,212 --> 01:48:15,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And so sometimes I think people who are coming from a bad faith perspective argue that inclusivity is removing opportunity.

964
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just not the case.

965
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:33,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that that's why we, or myself at the very least, feel like this is a very much recommitment to that work because we understand that this is an opportunity for all students, regardless of lived experience or characteristic, that they have the equal opportunity to be involved in what we offer here at Medford Public Schools.

966
01:48:33,544 --> 01:48:34,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

967
01:48:38,765 --> 01:48:39,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Olapade.

968
01:48:39,805 --> 01:48:40,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld?

969
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:53,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to again echo what Member Olapade said, but to note that this comes a little bit out of an executive order from the end of January, from about a month ago about

970
01:48:56,021 --> 01:48:57,502
[SPEAKER_04]: ending radical indoctrination.

971
01:48:57,582 --> 01:48:59,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that is what we're doing.

972
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we are supporting the district's commitment to educational materials.

973
01:49:05,966 --> 01:49:16,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also coming out of the Texas and Becerra case, which if people are not familiar with this, this is speaking to remove section 504 compliance.

974
01:49:17,771 --> 01:49:23,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's important that people know that these are some of the things that are happening

975
01:49:24,466 --> 01:49:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: here, and then I just also wanted to note that the, again, the laws have not changed here executive orders are not laws.

976
01:49:33,299 --> 01:49:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: This court case is pending, but things like I've spent I spent a fair bit of time with the.

977
01:49:39,588 --> 01:49:57,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Harvard affirmative action case and while race as a lone determinant was determined, was the Supreme Court handed down a verdict that said that was not a basis, that decision does actually affirm that lived experience and how

978
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:08,801
[SPEAKER_04]: identity characteristics, including race, inform your educational experience and your opportunity is in fact a reasonable basis for making decisions about what

979
01:50:09,967 --> 01:50:13,130
[SPEAKER_04]: belongs in policies and classrooms.

980
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:30,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is worth noting that these are laws that are in place and that they do, as member Olapade said, seek to expand and maintain opportunity and ensure that people are able to reach their full potential and be reflected in the learning environment.

981
01:50:33,782 --> 01:50:34,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, both.

982
01:50:36,364 --> 01:50:39,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a motion and a second, so I'm going to ask Member Ruseau to call the roll, please.

983
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:44,831

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the affirmative.

998
01:51:01,163 --> 01:51:01,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero in the negative.

999
01:51:02,564 --> 01:51:03,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1000
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:06,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any everyone.

1001
01:51:07,043 --> 01:51:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1002
