9
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

10
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Mallain.

11
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:50,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

12
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:54,214

[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lasing.

15

[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lazzaro.

16
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:02,900
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears.

17
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:03,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

18
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:05,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilor Callahan is present.

19
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:07,910
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

20
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Action and discussion items 25189 offered by President Bears's Amendment to Chapter 2 Article 5 Division 2 Medford Standard Compensation Ordinance.

21
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:20,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed this at the end of last year.

22
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:29,392
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a proposal to put a standard compensation provision in our city's procurement ordinances.

23
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a procurement

24
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: issue where we had a union contractor, a contractor went on to bid and a bunch of our union custodial staff, contractor custodial staff were let go.

25
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:53,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We later learned that this was essentially a procurement issue and we have been working

26
00:08:53,958 --> 00:09:08,887
[SPEAKER_03]: with the labor union that represents these workers to update our ordinances to make sure that union contractors and their employees have a fair shot at any contract that we're seeing and that all of our contracted workers

27
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,951
[SPEAKER_03]: are receiving fair pay and benefits.

28
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:16,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We put this into committee last December.

29
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:28,482
[SPEAKER_03]: We were planning to talk about it a couple weeks ago at our committee of the whole, but we ended up having a very long meeting on the ambulance contract and a number of people who wanted to speak to the matter were not able to stay for the rest of the meeting.

30
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here to talk about it tonight.

31
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I did just forward two amendments around via email.

32
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them,

33
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:54,903
[SPEAKER_03]: was in the agenda packet and it adjusts the section around how long the rebidding would be required for existing contracts that no longer comply.

34
00:09:54,923 --> 00:10:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It adjusts that period of time to give a bit more time for the city to get those contracts rebid and get contracts that are in compliance.

35
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and then there's also an amendment to the definitions for the, where are we here?

36
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:27,642
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount under standard compensation, so it adjusts what standards we're using for compensation and benefits for the two qualified classes of employees.

37
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:39,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some representatives from 32BJ SEIU with us, including the executive vice president, Kevin Brown, who's here with us, and members of their policy team are with us on Zoom as well.

38
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:47,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to give them a chance to explain the ordinance a bit more, explain some of the adjustments that are proposed tonight,

39
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:57,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can hear from questions from Councilors, but I do want to open the floor to Councilors if they have any comments before we move to the presentation.

40
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:00,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lazzaro.

41
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:02,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

42
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you bringing this forward.

43
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is a really great solution to the issue that

44
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:16,466
[SPEAKER_11]: we faced in the city, it seemed like it was a negotiation issue.

45
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:20,607
[SPEAKER_11]: It seemed like it might have been a problem with cutting costs.

46
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:31,451
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seems like what it really was is we needed to just solidify a floor for the way that we are making sure we're taking care of the people that work for the city.

47
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:37,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a very standard thing that we should be ensuring that

48
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:53,972
[SPEAKER_11]: were not inadvertently bypassing union workers who have thought to be paid a living wage in the city.

49
00:11:54,132 --> 00:12:02,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate how carefully this was done, but I also, I'm very curious to hear more from the union representatives.

50
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And I haven't had a chance to review the,

51
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:11,159
[SPEAKER_11]: edits to the, that just came in.

52
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:19,622
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if President Bears can speak to that, how those changes will impact the total ordinance.

53
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, just I'll be brief and then I know there's some people who can explain it.

54
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:30,751
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit more in detail than I can, but essentially it just uses different standards.

55
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:45,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So previously we were looking at some state prevailing wage law, and now we're looking at the contracts in the city of Boston as a baseline, as well as Department of Labor, Federal Department of Labor, something called the Service Contract Act of 1965.

56
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just using a different standard for the,

57
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:58,186
[SPEAKER_03]: for how the wages, wage floors will be determined and benefits floors will be determined.

58
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:07,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the only other piece that's changing is how long the city and would have, the procurement department would have to rebid contracts that aren't in compliance with that.

59
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:10,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a short answer.

60
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,573
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

61
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:22,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do have representatives from 32BJ here with us, if they'd like to speak, and then I know there's some folks on Zoom as well.

62
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:24,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

63
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I push?

64
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.

65
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:28,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

66
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:34,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the opportunity to share with you tonight.

67
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:39,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Council President Bears and to all the council members.

68
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:55,007
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had 14 members who were basically fired last year when the contract at the schools went out for bid, and they awarded it to the lowest bidder, which is a company that paid minimum wage.

69
00:13:55,928 --> 00:14:10,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Our members made more than the minimum wage with some benefits, and the new company underbid them, and you were forced to award it to that company because they were the low bidder.

70
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:18,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So the prevailing wage ordinance that's before you would help to remedy that situation.

71
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:24,357
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is create a level playing field where all the contractors are bidding on the same wage and benefit levels.

72
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:32,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take the wage and benefits out of the bid process and companies are competing on their ability to manage a contract, their ability to buy

73
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:44,284
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, supplies and other things and how much they pay the managers of the company, but not of the basic workers, and which we think is a very important premise that you shouldn't do the race to the bottom.

74
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:49,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And because public contracting almost always required, not always, but

75
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:55,755
[SPEAKER_00]: very frequently requires lowest bidder, then you'll get a minimum wage contractor.

76
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:56,775
[SPEAKER_00]: So this avoids that.

77
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:09,720
[SPEAKER_00]: As the Council President very articulately just stated, when the bid goes out, they either use the greater of the Service Contract Act wage or the prevailing wage, which is paid

78
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:18,325
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 13,000 janitors in the metropolitan, well, the state of Massachusetts and, you know, for the most part, metropolitan Boston area.

79
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:25,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just takes the greater of those two for wages and benefits and implements it, and it's a level playing field.

80
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:32,417
[SPEAKER_00]: However many contractors bid, they bid, but they're not bidding to underbid based on how low you can pay the workers.

81
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:33,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that's great.

82
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:46,938
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have colleagues who are on the phone or on Zoom, I guess, who are much more articulate than me, who can explain a lot better the process.

83
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:47,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

84
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I will give folks a chance to turn on their video if they're on Zoom.

85
00:15:54,162 --> 00:16:00,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you want to raise your hand and you want to present, I will unmute you.

86
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I see David Miller.

87
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So David, I will unmute you first.

88
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:26,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so as Kevin was just explaining, we've done this in a number of cities as well as states to basically take labor costs out of competition and it leads to a more fair situation and process for the workers.

89
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:28,854
[SPEAKER_05]: under those contracts.

90
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:36,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, the way that this works, we can point to Cambridge and Boston as good examples.

91
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:54,336
[SPEAKER_05]: When a city department or agency wants to solicit a bid for janitorial services or security services, they will request a rate sheet from the Department of Labor Standards.

92
00:16:56,057 --> 00:17:02,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The DLS will provide those on request, even though city work isn't covered under the state prevailing wage law.

93
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that schedule will be included as an attachment to the bids.

94
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:15,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It spells out very clearly what the rates are for each year.

95
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:24,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And then bidders can submit a costing plan that reflects that.

96
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, do you want to jump in here?

97
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:34,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Rob.

98
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:44,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I can just speak to the amendments that were recently made to the wage standard.

99
00:17:45,433 --> 00:18:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, we had originally looked at the language that Cambridge had, which ties the wage standard to Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 149, Section 27H.

100
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:16,493
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of Medford's location, it would have actually ended up with the contracted workers at the school making less than they had been making previously.

101
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, 27H ties to

102
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:33,823
[SPEAKER_01]: the largest contract in Boston essentially anyways, so we thought it would be easier to just simplify the language and just tie it directly to that contract.

103
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both, and I appreciate your research on this.

104
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:45,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

105
00:18:54,849 --> 00:19:02,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, we do have our Procurement Director, Maxwell, and our Facilities Director, Paul Riggi, here.

106
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do see Paul's hand.

107
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Paul, I will go to you.

108
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:13,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, President Bears.

109
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:13,736
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

110
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:15,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

111
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here.

112
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a problem.

113
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:23,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a few comments and a few concerns.

114
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:30,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, I believe someone said that we awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.

115
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:33,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That is incorrect.

116
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:37,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not look at pricing when we bid the contract.

117
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We reviewed all companies equally.

118
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,878
[SPEAKER_07]: There were seven people that reviewed

119
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,430
[SPEAKER_07]: the bidders that were interviewed.

120
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:57,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the determination of the entire committee to go with a different company.

121
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not know the pricing.

122
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, one of the questions, did not ask the companies if they were union or non-unionized.

123
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,588
[SPEAKER_07]: To us, that was not

124
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:14,190
[SPEAKER_07]: point that we needed to make.

125
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,274
[SPEAKER_07]: What we wanted to know is that they could do the work that was required by the school department.

126
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:28,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Then after we came up with the top candidate, we looked at the pricing.

127
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,683
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only time we knew what the pricing was.

128
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:37,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you that the contract was not awarded to the lowest bidder.

129
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's number one.

130
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:54,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, all employees of that former company were offered the opportunity to work with the new contract holder.

131
00:20:57,074 --> 00:21:09,978
[SPEAKER_07]: They were allowed to interview for positions and allowed, and if they wanted to and were deemed worthy to hire, they were hired for positions with the new contractor.

132
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:14,954
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't our intention to put anyone out of work.

133
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:19,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking for the contractor to do the best job for the school department.

134
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:26,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, the city of Medford has no way of getting the prevailing wage rate.

135
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I tested this theory two weeks ago where I requested the prevailing wage for janitorial services.

136
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It was denied by the state.

137
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:40,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Reason being, we are not covered by prevailing wage.

138
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:47,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have no way of knowing what a prevailing wage is for janitorial services.

139
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:51,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Boston sets a wage.

140
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,435
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not use the prevailing wage.

141
00:21:54,535 --> 00:22:04,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Number four, if the wage the city of Medford sets is lower than what the contract holder pays, are we telling them to pay their employees less?

142
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:15,352
[SPEAKER_07]: That's certainly a question that the city council needs to take seriously.

143
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:21,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not ask the contract holder what they pay their employees.

144
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,934
[SPEAKER_07]: My expectation is that they follow the letter of the law.

145
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:30,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Employees are paid benefits that they're entitled to and get paid a fair wage.

146
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that every person that does

147
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,984
[SPEAKER_07]: a job and has a job should be paid a fair wage.

148
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:59,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have concerns that we have entered into a legal contract with a company and now the city of Medford wants to renegotiate that contract based on some misinformation.

149
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:10,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will let Fiona speak if she has any other information she wants to pass on.

150
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:12,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your time.

151
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:14,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

152
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:27,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Maxwell, if you'd like to, feel free to raise your hand or come on video.

153
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We can recognize you.

154
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,534
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, do we have any questions or comments from the council?

155
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:43,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lazzaro.

156
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:51,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this wouldn't be workable then if we can't access the standard rate of pay.

157
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand how, I'm confused.

158
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:56,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm confused.

159
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yeah, I don't know what that's all about.

160
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:01,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

161
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

162
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:13,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not originally going to dig into the past and the making of this decision.

163
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:20,128
[SPEAKER_02]: However, after those comments, I do have a quick question and really I'm hoping for a very short answer.

164
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:27,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like the committee that made the decision did not look at price and they did not look at whether the organizations were unionized.

165
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:34,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to have just in 30 seconds a short list of any categories of things they did look at because now I'm curious.

166
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:39,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I will recognize Procurement Manager Maxwell.

167
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:40,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

168
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've asked you to unmute.

169
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:56,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you did have your hand up.

170
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Paul Riggis put his hand up and I'll recognize him.

171
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Councilor Callahan.

172
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:15,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the questions.

173
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We looked at, we had some requirements that we asked all vendors to provide to us when they came to a meeting.

174
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: One was to give us a PowerPoint presentation of what their company could provide for the city of Medford.

175
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:41,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, the incumbent company did not provide us with that PowerPoint presentation.

176
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:44,735
[SPEAKER_07]: We then interviewed

177
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:54,626
[SPEAKER_07]: the companies and ask them very pointed questions about how they go about cleaning a building, the processes they use.

178
00:25:55,967 --> 00:26:02,675
[SPEAKER_07]: When the incumbent was asked about how many people they had working in a certain building, they couldn't answer my question.

179
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:14,814
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't provide a lot of information during the interview process, where the other companies were very forthcoming with information when we asked them.

180
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,535
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked them about cleaning styles.

181
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,877
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they handle their supplies?

182
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:25,540
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they handle if there's a snow day and getting buildings cleaned?

183
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,802
[SPEAKER_07]: How would they handle summer work?

184
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Our interview questions were very fact-based and based on

185
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:59,977
[SPEAKER_07]: cleaning processes, and how they go about working with the staff in the buildings, and how they report problems if they find problems, and how they have supervision of their staff, and how they provide that, and if they have a supervisor that inspects the work of the people that are in the buildings.

186
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:17,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So we never asked them during that entire process if they were unionized and the pricing was not, was in a sealed envelope and was not unsealed until we made our decision.

187
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:26,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So they came in, the proposals and the pricing came in in two separate envelopes.

188
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing we opened that the procurement office opened was the actual proposal with how many people they planned on each building, how many man hours per day, per week, per month, and those kinds of things.

189
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:48,070
[SPEAKER_07]: The pricing was left in another sealed envelope.

190
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:51,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

191
00:27:52,782 --> 00:27:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.

192
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:54,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very helpful and informative.

193
00:27:56,265 --> 00:28:00,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear where in the process this is.

194
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:06,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain how much legal review it's had, even informally, not necessarily even the...

195
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:21,630
[SPEAKER_02]: City legal review, and it does seem like, and I should have said this up front, that I fully appreciate, President Bears, your long relationship with unions and your experience there.

196
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:23,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that this is coming to the floor.

197
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:30,597
[SPEAKER_02]: really important, I think, to a lot of folks who live in Medford.

198
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:44,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people here in Medford are pro-union, myself included, and want to make sure that workers are supported and are able to work in a union-supportive workplace.

199
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:53,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am inclined to support generally this kind of legislation.

200
00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:07,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to hear a little bit more background about sort of what stage this is at, who has been consulted in it, and just a little bit of background.

201
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:08,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

202
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:08,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

203
00:29:14,908 --> 00:29:24,152
[SPEAKER_03]: What contractor's good, what contractor's bad, what company we're defending or not defending, and I think that's like missing the forest for the trees big time on this, right?

204
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:29,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what some contractor does.

205
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:32,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I want us to get the best services to the city.

206
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:37,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also want to do that while we uphold our basic values, right?

207
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:48,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is that we want workers to make a living wage, to have benefits, and we ideally would like those workers to be unionized, right?

208
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:49,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And this ordinance

209
00:29:52,405 --> 00:30:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: very clearly says that those are values that we care about here in Medford, that we want to set a floor so that anyone who bids for a contract with the City of Medford has to meet the same labor standards, that labor peace and supporting union workers is a value that we have.

210
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:14,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't know, I've never spoken to anyone from any contractor, right?

211
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never spoken to some company that says, oh, we're mad we didn't get this contract and that's why we're here.

212
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,424
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is that there were 14 union workers who worked for our schools cleaning them.

213
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:35,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And if their management wasn't doing the right thing by the schools, that's one thing.

214
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:38,450
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't mean that those workers

215
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:43,815
[SPEAKER_03]: have to either lose their union rights or lose their jobs to keep doing the work that they're doing.

216
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what this is about, first and foremost.

217
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:48,999
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we set a floor?

218
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confident that we can get the data that we need to get to understand what that wage floor is.

219
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy if contractors wanted to go above that floor.

220
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really good thing.

221
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,296
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we also all know how cost minimization and capitalism works and the fact that we've decided that.

222
00:31:09,895 --> 00:31:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: these kind of jobs should be private, and we should contract them, you know, that means we have to put protections in place around that, and that's really what this is about.

223
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:22,740
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of legal review, again, you know, I've worked with the team at 32BJ.

224
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:34,744
[SPEAKER_03]: There's very similar ordinances in place in neighboring communities to make sure that when contracts get bid, there's a wage floor, and that we try to make sure that the companies that we work with are union.

225
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are values that I have.

226
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are values that Medford has.

227
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where it is in the process.

228
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if there are questions, we have some experts right here who can tell how do we get the wage rates, right?

229
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's an unsolvable problem.

230
00:31:50,493 --> 00:32:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying that anyone, that the process for this, I'm not saying it was good, but obviously the rules were not in place to make sure that union workers didn't lose their jobs.

231
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:07,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really where it's coming from, from my end.

232
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:12,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I did see a hand from one of the policy team folks at 32BJ.

233
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:19,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to talk about how it's possible for cities to access the wage rates that we're talking about.

234
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:26,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would just be helpful information to make sure everybody knows how they can get the information they would need to set the floor for bidding.

235
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it was David or Rob, but feel free to wave.

236
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:37,117
Rob, go ahead.

237
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

238
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:58,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the new amendments, the wage rates will be easy to figure out because it's the greater of the contract covering the greatest number of janitorial workers in Boston, assuming that covers at least 500 workers.

239
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:02,048
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those contracts are publicly available.

240
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:07,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the SEA rate, which, again, is accessible

241
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:10,834
[SPEAKER_01]: through the federal government's website.

242
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:13,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

243
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to Vice President Lazzaro.

244
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:24,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It does seem to me that the wage rates are not that accessible.

245
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:35,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's possible that what may seem accessible to somebody who's very intimately involved with these numbers and with the way that they're accessed online

246
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:39,180
[SPEAKER_11]: just that might not be common practice for people that work for cities.

247
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:48,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So could we be more explicit in the way that it's worded in the ordinance or the way that it's communicated with city employees for the future?

248
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:53,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there something that we could edit for that or a guideline or something?

249
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if it's going to change, is there something else we could put in?

250
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:13,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if that was going to be, if this is going to be something that is in an ordinance and then is too difficult for our city staff to execute and it just doesn't happen, like, I feel like we have a problem in the city where

251
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:25,537
[SPEAKER_11]: We write ordinances in city council, they become law, and then they don't go into practice because they're not being enforced or executed at all.

252
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:34,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think it's useful to have an ordinance that people can't make come to pass.

253
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,142
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can hear from city staff about, like, if this is not something that they can do, then there's no point to it.

254
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we're talking about emailing links.

255
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:51,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that that's hard to do.

256
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:11,467
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's emailing links, that's one thing, but if it's in an ordinance and it's gonna be, if it will be changing, if there's some standard thing that will, if there's something that people can go back to over the course of years to see, if Boston sets their rates,

257
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, the hourly rate paid to workers and the relevant classification, right.

258
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it seems clear to me.

259
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:29,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know that if we're going to put this into our code of ordinances, that it's going to be carried out.

260
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:35,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm happy to recognize someone, but I just want to say, like,

261
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:38,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Cities are doing this, it's doable.

262
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:55,113
[SPEAKER_03]: If we need to contact another community that's doing this to understand how they access the information, I think that's eminently doable and I respect, I agree with your observation that we pass ordinances and then enforcement doesn't happen in many cases, but I don't think that's because the information isn't available.

263
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:00,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw Councilor Leming and then Councilor Callahan.

264
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:12,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just like to push back on the idea that we shouldn't put things into law because we don't think they'll be...

265
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:25,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to push back on the notion that we shouldn't put things into law just because we don't think that they'll be executed.

266
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:30,949
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're not being executed, then that's not our fault.

267
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:42,012
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the responsibility of the executive branch of city staff to enforce laws that are put on the books, and if they turn out to be

268
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:47,502
[SPEAKER_10]: unenforceable or illegal, then it's the judiciary who would strike that down.

269
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:54,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is, that's a thought I'd like to put out there.

270
00:36:59,215 --> 00:36:59,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

271
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:01,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another question.

272
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:16,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading through the standard hourly rate of pay, and it may be that this is just legalese, that it's a little more complicated than I understand, but it does appear that it is now the greatest of the following.

273
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:19,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, is this one of the ones that got updated, got changed?

274
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:20,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

275
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:21,773
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an update in your email.

276
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:27,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked and I apologize that I'm maybe not, it's just not right in front of my eyes.

277
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:29,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask my question?

278
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,121
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just tell me if this question is moot now because it changed.

279
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:36,484
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like it's the greatest of three things.

280
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:42,549
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is basically the Department of Labor Standards, rate of wages,

281
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:50,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is the hourly rate paid to workers in the relevant classification under a preceding building services contract, I assume in Medford.

282
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third one.

283
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:59,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is standard hourly rate of pay for covered janitorial services employees.

284
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:04,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this entire thing is both janitorial and security, but this is under janitorial.

285
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one is very specifically rate paid to workers in the relevant classification under active collective bargaining agreement covering the largest number of security guards.

286
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the language is amended.

287
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:20,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That language isn't, thank you?

288
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:23,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the hourly rate of wages, there's two options.

289
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: The hourly rate of wages required for work performed within the city of Boston under the collective bargaining agreement covering the largest number of hourly non-supervisory janitorial building service employees, provided the collective bargaining agreement covers no less than 500 employees.

290
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:48,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one is the hourly weight of wages for the relevant classification as established by the Secretary of Labor, United States Secretary of Labor pursuant to Chapter 67 of 41 U.S.C.

291
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:59,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Section 6701, which is set forth in the locality determined and issued by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for the area that includes the City of Medford.

292
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a federal standard and then there's a collective bargaining standard from the City of Boston.

293
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:10,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, and is it still framed as the greatest of two or three?

294
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:12,555
[SPEAKER_03]: The greater of the following two, yeah.

295
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Greater of the following two, great.

296
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will look up right now, see if I can find that in my email.

297
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:19,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize that I did not have that in front of me.

298
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:22,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Rich sent it out about 40 minutes ago.

299
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's the entire thing, right?

300
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:25,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

301
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I saw that one.

302
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:28,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was the one that I had in my hands.

303
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:34,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I just assume that it has been looked into this whole greater of that.

304
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:34,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

305
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no issue with this is maybe standard and from other cities.

306
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,186
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way that they do it in other cities as well.

307
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:40,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

308
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:41,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

309
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

310
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:42,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

311
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:43,370
Great.

312
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lazzaro.

313
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:46,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

314
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:57,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to be very clear that it was never my intention to say that because an ordinance may not be enforced that we should not pass ordinances.

315
00:39:57,363 --> 00:40:00,666
[SPEAKER_11]: My suggestion is that we should write our ordinances in a way

316
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: that it is as easy as possible for them to be enforced.

317
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:23,821
[SPEAKER_11]: If something is able to be honed and clarified, that we should do that now while we're writing the ordinance, not have to go back and help our city staff through enforcing and carrying out our ordinances.

318
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:28,625
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, we have a leaf blower ordinance.

319
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:44,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And one very dedicated resident who is basically single-handedly enforcing the leaf blower ordinance instead of city staff, who I would love to see doing that instead of him.

320
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:55,539
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is not ridiculous to have ordinances written by a city council and city staff carrying out the ordinances.

321
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, that's how cities operate.

322
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,619
[SPEAKER_11]: all over the Commonwealth, and I know we can do it.

323
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:01,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe in us.

324
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everybody, for your hard work.

325
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:08,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never mean to say that we shouldn't do ordinances.

326
00:41:08,787 --> 00:41:09,467
[SPEAKER_11]: That was not my point.

327
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:10,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

328
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:19,548
[SPEAKER_06]: For a councilor who famously hates ordinances, she's gotten a lot of them passed, so.

329
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:22,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

330
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Lazzaro's point is well taken.

331
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:41,861
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm hearing different, you know, points of feedback and advocacy here tonight, and I think what is really important is what the Council President reminded us, and not to miss the forest for the trees.

332
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:49,022
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we can relitigate what happened in the school case and, you know.

333
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:53,414
[SPEAKER_06]: The work that we do here a lot of it is perspective.

334
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It's looking into the future and saying what what can we do better?

335
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:59,839
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we fix now so that we do better in the future?

336
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:17,651
[SPEAKER_06]: and so that's why I Support this ordinance and I you know, I think we need to do better by our workers going forward I think all of us have said something to the fact over, you know last few years of Medford is a Union City we stand up for workers and

337
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,806
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, passing this ordinance is...

338
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,142
[SPEAKER_06]: living true to our values as a city and living true to what we've said.

339
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:34,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear the kind of concerns from the city administration about putting this into effect.

340
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:41,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it is really important to underscore again that other municipalities have an ordinance like this.

341
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:43,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not unique.

342
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't be the trailblazer on this issue.

343
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:48,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be essentially,

344
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: just joining the wave of municipalities that are standing up for their workers.

345
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:56,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when it comes to enforcement,

346
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:05,183
[SPEAKER_06]: We have many municipalities we can learn from, that we can draw from, that we can talk to in terms of implementation.

347
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:11,968
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about legality, you know, I'm sure those cities have had their city solicitors.

348
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you'd look up.

349
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:22,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make a motion to hire Justin today.

350
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:34,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, they've had legal, you know, their city's council review their ordinances as well.

351
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:41,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it comes to that question of legality, I'm just not as worried about it right now because, again, other cities have done it.

352
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:43,997
[SPEAKER_06]: They've reviewed it as well.

353
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:45,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know,

354
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:52,779
[SPEAKER_06]: This falls purely within the police powers of the municipality, it seems, you know, completely fine by me.

355
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And with regards to the kind of, you know, the legal aspect of what we usually have to consider with ordinances.

356
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

357
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to our Procurement Director, Fiona Maxwell.

358
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:14,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, good evening, everybody.

359
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to chime in.

360
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:27,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here making all kinds of notes and I'm going to apologize for circling back around.

361
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to circle back around to the beginning of the meeting and some other participants comments as well as some other

362
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:44,308
[SPEAKER_04]: comments made about the procurement process.

363
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:50,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And I might reiterate some of Paul's points that he shared.

364
00:44:52,990 --> 00:45:08,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So overall, the ordinance, the proposed ordinance, my initial discussion wanted to be more around the ordinance itself and

365
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:23,197
[SPEAKER_04]: what it entails and more of a, it warrants more time for consideration from a procurement perspective.

366
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:39,728
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of sections that I could take the time to go through each, but I think it would be a very lengthy conversation and it would need to be an interactive conversation.

367
00:45:40,943 --> 00:45:55,609
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as each of the sections that are outlined in the ordinance, and especially when it comes to the responsibility and the maintaining and the monitoring and the enforcing of the Procurement Department.

368
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:07,874
[SPEAKER_04]: With this original project, this janitorial cleaning services that we've been doing for almost 10 plus years that I've been here,

369
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:23,651
[SPEAKER_04]: The process under the statute of 30B was not an invitation for bid, which was what I believe Kevin, David, and Rob explained.

370
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:31,193
[SPEAKER_04]: The procurement department or the city and the school department took under a request for proposal procurement method.

371
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:37,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And under the statute, a procurement officer can determine that this is the best route for this kind of

372
00:46:38,503 --> 00:46:39,664
[SPEAKER_04]: these kind of services.

373
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:49,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that means is we put together a request for proposal that takes a lot of time to put together a lot of input from city and school staff.

374
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And it outlines many, many things.

375
00:46:54,812 --> 00:47:06,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It outlines the scope of work, what's included, it outlines an evaluation criteria, it might outline deliverables, and it provides vendors an opportunity to

376
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:37,454
[SPEAKER_04]: put together a proposal, a technical proposal that the city reviews, the committee reviews, and has evaluation criteria and metrics and scores that the technical proposal receives in and after a lengthy process, and whether that includes interviews, and in this case it did, with city school

377
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:53,216
[SPEAKER_04]: staff, with city and school staff, interviews with each of the vendors, then what we do are under the process, under procurement process and RFP, then the prices are opened.

378
00:47:54,116 --> 00:47:55,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Prices are reviewed.

379
00:47:56,377 --> 00:47:59,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do just want to

380
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:08,706
[SPEAKER_04]: reiterate that what Paul said the award was not based on the lowest bidder.

381
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:25,752
[SPEAKER_04]: The award is based on the most reasonable responsible vendor providing the service the city needs based and then based on a price.

382
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:29,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure everybody understands and

383
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a difference, there's a big difference.

384
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about the procurement process and the procurement issues, I just want to make sure that everybody understands that I'm not sure what the procurement issues were.

385
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:56,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my opinion, the procurement department took

386
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: and went through a procurement process under the statute, the law, and awarded based on a number of things.

387
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not award to the lowest bidder.

388
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:16,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a completely different process.

389
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess why we're all here is we're understanding that the reason, or as a result,

390
00:49:27,537 --> 00:49:31,360
[SPEAKER_04]: proposed compensation ordinance is before us.

391
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:40,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not had a lot of time to review this ordinance.

392
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a very high level review on my end, especially just after learning about this being on the agenda late Friday.

393
00:49:54,347 --> 00:50:05,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anything, I think there's some great questions and I think Councilor Lanzaro brings up a really good point.

394
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where I really would like to have more dialogue.

395
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it warrants more of a conversation.

396
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:20,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure if this is the perfect forum for that or how that works, but

397
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:36,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I do want to see, you know, I do want to see the city be able to adopt an ordinance or I'm in support of working with the city council to, to adopt an ordinance, you know, um, for all, all of the right reasons.

398
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:43,741
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have several questions about specific sections of this ordinance.

399
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:48,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a better detailed.

400
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding and especially when it comes to the termination sections of current contracts that we have.

401
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,358
[SPEAKER_04]: There are termination clauses.

402
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,340
[SPEAKER_04]: There are terminations for convenience.

403
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: There are clauses there are there are.

404
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: There's language that needs to be reviewed.

405
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's language that's been executed.

406
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:13,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Contractors have been executed.

407
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:15,154
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to be reviewed.

408
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:28,285
[SPEAKER_04]: for each of the sections to limit any exposure to the city for future or potential claims.

409
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just executing a contract.

410
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna make sure that that's really recognized in this ordinance and also the enforce section.

411
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,171
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many sections in the enforceable

412
00:51:45,516 --> 00:52:02,824
[SPEAKER_04]: section that mentions procurement and some of the requirements of procurement, some of the duties and the requirements, and in some cases even some legal actions, some subpoenas.

413
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, in my experience, the Attorney General's Fair Labor Division is the enforcer.

414
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:11,869
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the

415
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: they're the holder, they're the branch of these fair labor standards.

416
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:36,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I think it was maybe Rob or David, maybe Rob, you mentioned, Paul mentioned not being able to, requesting prevailing wages is a simple task.

417
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the procurement function and I,

418
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:44,899
[SPEAKER_04]: have confidence in my staff, myself, that we're able to do that.

419
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:51,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not something that we need to be trained on.

420
00:52:51,085 --> 00:53:02,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But what needs to be understood is the prevailing wage, the Department of Labor Standards has these rates set.

421
00:53:03,736 --> 00:53:03,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And

422
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:14,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And under procurement, we're required to request those rates for specific jobs that are projects or services that require those.

423
00:53:17,855 --> 00:53:27,902
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Labor Standards does not recognize that janitorial services for municipalities, schools, cities, and towns applies.

424
00:53:28,262 --> 00:53:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand what the ordinance is ultimately trying to do, but

425
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of my first question, like, where are these labor standards?

426
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:47,361
[SPEAKER_04]: How are these labor standards being computed?

427
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are these labor standards?

428
00:53:49,462 --> 00:53:52,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, Rob, you said something about SEA?

429
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,746
[SPEAKER_04]: SEA rates or Boston's?

430
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:00,596
[SPEAKER_04]: contract?

431
00:54:00,856 --> 00:54:05,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we looking to look at Boston and look at their contract rates they're paying their janitorial?

432
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:28,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a state building or is it like I guess these are all questions that I have that have come up and they're also questions that I've already that I have that this compensation ordinance proposal really requires a lot more legal

433
00:54:30,463 --> 00:54:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: which I'm not an expert in, but procurement policy, I consider myself familiar and maybe more of an expert.

434
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:55,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like the opportunity to talk further about some of those procurement policies.

435
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go through the whole ordinance if that's what you want, and we can take a look at each of the sections and talk about some of the questions I have.

436
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:21,816
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not sure if this is the exact forum to do that.

437
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:42,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I would request that we have some more time as a group or maybe procurement has an opportunity to have some input with the proposed ordinance.

438
00:55:45,669 --> 00:55:46,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Fiona.

439
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your comment and I just want to note

440
00:55:51,402 --> 00:55:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this was put on the agenda six weeks ago.

441
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:59,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan made an amendment to get that to the administration for review to be provided.

442
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have written review and comments, I mean, that would be much appreciated.

443
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:09,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like given the level of comments that you have on this, that would be the best way to go about it.

444
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:20,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I can also put you in touch with some folks from 32BJ, some folks from some of the other cities where they do this to your questions specifically on how this would be computed.

445
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:32,393
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is the, there's a law called the, excuse me, my computer just froze, but I want to get it right, which is the,

446
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: A Service Contract Act of 1965, the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and Employment Standards Division puts out information on that every year, talking about the rates.

447
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:54,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, another option was looking at collective bargaining agreements for the city of Boston to look at rates.

448
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were the two options presented here.

449
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:01,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really just want to note, and I hear your questions.

450
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:02,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you have detailed comments.

451
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We did ask the mayor and the chief of staff and the administration to send this to you six weeks ago.

452
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that didn't happen, that is

453
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:15,435
[SPEAKER_03]: that is unfortunate.

454
00:57:16,236 --> 00:57:19,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is really where we're coming from on this.

455
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:26,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you have the questions and written comments that you've put down, you can feel free to forward those to us right away.

456
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:29,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally would be happy to put you in touch with

457
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob or David or folks from communities like Somerville or Cambridge or other cities, their procurement departments, you know, they have very similar ordinances in place.

458
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:46,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it is a way that we can get you the information and answers to the questions that you're asking.

459
00:57:47,684 --> 00:57:48,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lazzaro.

460
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

461
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:58,512
[SPEAKER_11]: It's I appreciate a lot of what you were saying, Director Maxwell, and I think that

462
00:58:01,089 --> 00:58:04,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Ideally, these Committee of the Whole meetings are to delve into just one issue.

463
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,890
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a whole hour at least.

464
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,591
[SPEAKER_11]: On other nights, we could have even longer if it's the only meeting that's scheduled.

465
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is right before a regular meeting at 7, so we are sort of crunched for time.

466
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:19,673
[SPEAKER_11]: But the goal here is just for us to talk about this ordinance.

467
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:25,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can go super in-depth, and it seems like we'll have to push off the rest of the conversation to another time.

468
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:29,956
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can, the thinking is that we'll be able to go through and think through,

469
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:33,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a really good point.

470
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a really good point.

471
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:50,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing about the ordinances, even about, like, did it go to the lowest bidder?

472
00:58:50,158 --> 00:59:10,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, and we were never part of the negotiation process, so the assumption for us is probably that, oh, like, you know, maybe the employees in this new contract had received lower wages, and that's why we heard from so many staff that were let go or that did not want to work for the new company because their contracts would be for less money, and that's what they told us.

473
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:13,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So our assumption was that it was a lower bid.

474
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:19,320
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we don't know this information, but the point of this ordinance is not to say that you can't take the lowest bid.

475
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:25,368
[SPEAKER_11]: The point is just to say there's a standard rate of pay.

476
00:59:26,425 --> 00:59:31,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's something that's happening in other cities, so it can be done.

477
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:33,868
[SPEAKER_11]: We just have to figure out how to make sure it can happen.

478
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:42,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we're hoping to have these conversations now and make sure it's doable for everybody in the city.

479
00:59:44,092 --> 00:59:51,815
[SPEAKER_11]: And that it makes sense for our employees, our city staff, and that the legislation makes sense.

480
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:56,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate what you were saying.

481
00:59:57,125 --> 01:00:10,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I would motion to maybe table this and have another committee of the whole in the future when the after the procurement office can send us comments and questions really just as.

482
01:00:11,263 --> 01:00:15,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Many comments and questions as possible with as many specific requests as possible.

483
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:20,130
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be something that they would be asking for for us to incorporate into this if necessary.

484
01:00:20,531 --> 01:00:23,593
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean that's also complicated with open meeting law.

485
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:28,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that allowed to happen outside of the meeting or can they just send to the clerk?

486
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:43,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to connect Fiona directly with the folks that we have who are experts who can provide information or, you know, we could talk to our school committee member, Master Boney, who knows all the finance and procurement people in Somerville.

487
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:45,333
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an incredible resource for this sort of thing, yeah.

488
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:49,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I think there's a lot of options there, but I think, of course, that then,

489
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:51,303
[SPEAKER_03]: A written memo could be sent to us.

490
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:52,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But right.

491
01:00:52,684 --> 01:00:52,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

492
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:53,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are all options.

493
01:00:54,245 --> 01:01:04,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Love to get the feedback so that we know what proposals are being offered by city staff to address the concerns so that we can make sure this works for everybody.

494
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,769
[SPEAKER_11]: But we need to know what the concerns are.

495
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not going to be like no we can't do this at all.

496
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this will never be something that will be considered.

497
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:13,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

498
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:15,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

499
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:18,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

500
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:19,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to make a motion.

501
01:01:20,128 --> 01:01:36,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to, first of all, just describe that we have in the past with other ordinances, like our three road and control ordinances, the sponsor of those ordinances did work directly with our staff to, you know, see what their concerns were.

502
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:42,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is just a faster way to go that does not run us into OML.

503
01:01:46,575 --> 01:02:03,760
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor of this particular bill is amenable, and I think that was already just suggested, to putting together whatever meetings are necessary for the procurement department to get questions answered, be able to say any concerns, workshop this.

504
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:11,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I would move that we keep it in committee for one more session and also have some legal review.

505
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have dueling motions.

506
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:20,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see Fiona's hand is still up and Paul's hand.

507
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:23,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Fiona, I'll go back to you and then we can go to Paul.

508
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:28,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

509
01:02:30,565 --> 01:02:32,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, I just had a major cough.

510
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:34,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

511
01:02:34,237 --> 01:02:39,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the conversation and the motions.

512
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:45,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to be clear that I understand President Bears.

513
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:57,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about a timeline and so I just want to make sure I'm clear on the direction moving forward.

514
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:57,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this

515
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:14,617
[SPEAKER_04]: a discussion that, or would you like me to send you comments that I have under each of the sections, or is it a dialogue or conversation that I would have with you?

516
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:18,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We will connect.

517
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:26,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put you in touch with some people who can answer the questions better than I could, but I will connect with you after the meeting to do that.

518
01:03:27,813 --> 01:03:55,874
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, because, again, I would like to suggest that we look more closely at, if it's Boston, Cambridge, or Somerville, what their ordinances, what their language is, and especially how their procurement department sort of monitors and forces and works through them.

519
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:57,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

520
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to do that.

521
01:03:59,201 --> 01:03:59,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

522
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:00,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

523
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:00,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

524
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:02,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

525
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:05,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to our facilities manager.

526
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:10,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Bayers.

527
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:12,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Two comments.

528
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:19,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the act you mentioned is what prevailing wage has turned into.

529
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was the original prevailing wage act.

530
01:04:23,562 --> 01:04:30,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, the city of Boston, if I remember correctly, they create their wage themselves.

531
01:04:30,946 --> 01:04:35,548
[SPEAKER_07]: They have an entire office that monitors it, updates it every year.

532
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:40,771
[SPEAKER_07]: They also require all their vendors to submit weekly certified payroll.

533
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,331
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they track it.

534
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:48,094
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not use any outside organization to develop this wage.

535
01:04:48,554 --> 01:04:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it all in-house.

536
01:04:52,276 --> 01:04:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

537
01:04:53,617 --> 01:04:53,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

538
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:01,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President.

539
01:05:01,885 --> 01:05:03,285
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be extremely brief.

540
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:04,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Just three points.

541
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,869
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's not correct that the workers were offered jobs.

542
01:05:10,529 --> 01:05:12,010
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the workers were offered jobs.

543
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:17,872
[SPEAKER_00]: They came before you earlier last year, previously in last year, to say that they were not offered jobs.

544
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:28,089
[SPEAKER_00]: charges filed before the National Labor Relations Board, where an investigation has taken place, and we're waiting for a decision from the NLRB.

545
01:05:28,129 --> 01:05:29,931
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been moving very slowly these days.

546
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:36,776
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that these workers were not offered jobs by Partners Facility Services, that's one.

547
01:05:37,637 --> 01:05:41,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, in terms of the information, the Consul President laid it out very well.

548
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:49,866
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also happy to provide that information directly to the city, our research and policy department.

549
01:05:50,606 --> 01:05:55,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Many jurisdictions all over the East Coast ask for the information directly from us.

550
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide the SCA rates, the Service Contract Act rates.

551
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:06,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to speak just for a second about why the SCA was created.

552
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:15,994
[SPEAKER_00]: The service contract 60 years ago was created as an effort so that the public sector does not undermine the private sector.

553
01:06:17,235 --> 01:06:26,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So we negotiate with 60 contractors every three or four years a master agreement that sets the rates for the industry for janitors and for security officers.

554
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:34,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that rate is set, we don't, all the private owners are agreeing to pay that for their services.

555
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:48,539
[SPEAKER_00]: But SCA did, Service Contract Act, S-C-A, not S-E-A, S-C-A, will say, okay, we want to base it upon whatever the private sector has agreed to pay so that the public sector doesn't undermine the private sector.

556
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why the law was created.

557
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, that's exactly what this law would do.

558
01:06:54,802 --> 01:07:03,708
[SPEAKER_00]: is make sure that the public sector is not undermining what the private sector has already agreed to pay to the janitors, to the security officers.

559
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:08,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It's level playing field based upon the private sector, not the public sector.

560
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:25,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And thirdly, whatever questions that the Procurement Department and the Facilities Department have, our Policy Department would be more than happy to respond in writing to answer any of those issues that they've raised as well as what they've raised tonight.

561
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:27,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

562
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:30,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that.

563
01:07:30,986 --> 01:07:37,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the thing that frustrates me is, once again, we put this on the agenda in December.

564
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:42,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been six weeks.

565
01:07:43,366 --> 01:07:48,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like the message didn't get to the people it needed to get to, that this was something that they needed to look at.

566
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:54,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like there's frustration from our city staff about the amount of time they've had to review it.

567
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have questions at this point.

568
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:57,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've pushed this back.

569
01:07:57,691 --> 01:08:00,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a meeting on the calendar two weeks ago.

570
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on that, or I guess three weeks ago now.

571
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:05,354
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on that agenda.

572
01:08:06,354 --> 01:08:07,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So the information has been available.

573
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:20,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to wonder, and I'm just getting really frustrated with the idea, and it goes to your point, Councilor Lazzaro, from earlier, which is we put things forward to be considered.

574
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very clear thing, right?

575
01:08:23,038 --> 01:08:26,960
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that if you're a janitor or security contractor with the city,

576
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,521
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have a wage floor.

577
01:08:28,841 --> 01:08:31,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't be undermining private sector wages.

578
01:08:31,203 --> 01:08:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't have a race to the bottom.

579
01:08:32,784 --> 01:08:39,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And we support and want people to be in unions because unions protect workers and help provide living wages.

580
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to harken back to something I said, which is that I want to be a city of yes.

581
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,976
[SPEAKER_03]: A city that says, how do we get to yes?

582
01:08:52,136 --> 01:08:53,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are values that we have.

583
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:54,338
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the law that we need to write?

584
01:08:55,458 --> 01:09:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: This ordinance as proposed is an ordinance that is enforceable and in force in communities two miles down the road based on essentially a principle from the law from 60 years ago.

585
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:09,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that means that it's hard to get to yes.

586
01:09:09,706 --> 01:09:17,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think it's a lot harder to get to yes when six weeks after an ordinance has been presented, the person who needs to implement it is hearing about it three days before the meeting.

587
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just really have deep frustrations with the administration of our city

588
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:32,067
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to be honest, to Councilor Callahan's point, I don't work for the mayor, right?

589
01:09:32,147 --> 01:09:36,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I shouldn't have to do, we don't have a city solicitor.

590
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:43,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it is not the responsibility of this policymaking body to enforce the loss, to make it work.

591
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:54,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And if our staff need more time and more resources or need to find out about things earlier so that they can have all the preparation they need and ask the questions, the resources are right here, the resources are in the room.

592
01:09:55,418 --> 01:09:58,779
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have people who are doing this across the country who can provide answers.

593
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm happy to make those connections at this point.

594
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:10,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't question our city staff's reasonable questions and wanting answers to those questions.

595
01:10:10,642 --> 01:10:16,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But this body took a vote six weeks ago to have our administration work on those answers.

596
01:10:16,763 --> 01:10:23,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like the people who needed to provide those answers were not made aware that they needed to do that work.

597
01:10:24,502 --> 01:10:33,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And that lack of coordination I think has led to a lot of problems over the last year where this council is just trying to get its job done.

598
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:36,989
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to pass the policies that we agree on based on the values that we have.

599
01:10:37,749 --> 01:10:44,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's procedural stonewalling that happens.

600
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:49,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's just because the right people aren't getting the information that they need in a timely manner, you know,

601
01:10:50,327 --> 01:10:54,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that's intentional or unintentional, either way, the result is the same.

602
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:59,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to work with you, Fiona, get the information across.

603
01:11:00,774 --> 01:11:05,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, it's just very frustrating.

604
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I put this on in December because this was something we wanted to look at.

605
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We sent it to Committee of the Whole.

606
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: We scheduled that meeting in January.

607
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:15,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have to delay it another two weeks.

608
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:16,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been a lot of time here.

609
01:11:21,707 --> 01:11:33,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very frustrating that we keep ending up at this point because the people who need to get the information, for somehow there's something in the way of this council, this council's work.

610
01:11:34,516 --> 01:11:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very frustrating.

611
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

612
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:54,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Council President, I know we joked earlier, but you said it again, and this is before you said it, it was something that was really poignant, was the fact that something that, why we laughed is because I really pushed this for many, many years, and it is the lack of a city solicitor.

613
01:11:57,696 --> 01:12:07,823
[SPEAKER_08]: We were very fortunate to work with great city solicitors like Mark Rumley and Kim Scanlon, and just recently Kevin Foley, and I like, I asked my colleagues, as we put,

614
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:14,132
[SPEAKER_08]: an agenda item like this, how many times, Mr. President, would you have already talked to the city solicitor?

615
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:17,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would then trigger what?

616
01:12:17,773 --> 01:12:29,697
[SPEAKER_08]: That city solicitor working with the departments in the building to say, hey, the council has brought up an issue that we need to focus on and work out and get the process rolling.

617
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:31,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, this is where we are.

618
01:12:32,218 --> 01:12:36,740
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that down the line, I'll be filing a resolution to, again, visit

619
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:42,436
[SPEAKER_08]: and not just visit but push forward the hiring of a city solicitor.

620
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:47,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And forget about the assistant city solicitor that we requested for the council.

621
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:48,638
[SPEAKER_08]: That we know will never happen.

622
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,439
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, there's a lot of variables because of this situation.

623
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:55,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, because of the way it's being presented.

624
01:12:56,595 --> 01:13:13,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem that we have from our city partners with our procurement officer who has nothing to blame here, truly not understanding, again, it's a slap in the face of the lack of communication that we're having throughout this community.

625
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:21,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it leaves questions because it's so open-ended, just like our ambulance contract, just like other contracts.

626
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:29,511
[SPEAKER_08]: just like our issues with the Teamsters and all the lawsuits that have been filed against the city administration.

627
01:13:30,251 --> 01:13:34,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Could this be more, could it be deep-rooted more in the lack of support of unions?

628
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:35,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

629
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:49,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's many questions that, because that this is the way that we have to handle situations and work as a city council, that leaves things open-ended for residents to then question, then drives what?

630
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:54,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Something we all hate and we've all talked about is divide, right?

631
01:13:55,395 --> 01:14:10,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've been trying so hard, especially since we've turned over for the new year, that working together, that we have no divisions here, that we're working for a common goal and making sure that we do the best we can for our residents.

632
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,401
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we don't have the commitment from our administration,

633
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:16,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's pretty sad.

634
01:14:16,895 --> 01:14:23,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for the effort, Mr. President, and I hope that this does go forward.

635
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:32,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the bottom line here is that seems to be forgotten sometimes because we're seeing it with all contract issues, right?

636
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:36,428
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing it with everything that's been an issue is what?

637
01:14:36,888 --> 01:14:37,929
[SPEAKER_08]: We're affecting real people.

638
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there are real people still out of work right now that are struggling.

639
01:14:44,389 --> 01:14:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And there isn't support there because we have nothing in place.

640
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:58,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could find a mechanism in place that other communities are using to support our workers here in the city of Medford, I think it's something we should all be focusing on.

641
01:14:59,039 --> 01:14:59,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Mr. President.

642
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

643
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Either of you, where do you want to, do you just want to refer this to the next committee of the whole?

644
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:11,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to

645
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:17,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I can withdraw my motion and go with Councilor Callahan's motion.

646
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:20,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second Councilor Callahan's motion.

647
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:24,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I would respectfully request that the motion be that we keep the paper in committee.

648
01:15:25,815 --> 01:15:31,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to work with Director Maxwell, Councilor Callahan.

649
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:35,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the motion, right?

650
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:35,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it in committee.

651
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I said keep it in committee.

652
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:37,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

653
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: While you have the opportunity to discuss with people, but also send to legal with the other half of my.

654
01:15:42,862 --> 01:15:43,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

655
01:15:43,062 --> 01:15:44,602
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the motion from six weeks ago, right?

656
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:47,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we request that it go to legal six weeks ago?

657
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:49,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It was requested to go to legal on December 16th.

658
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:50,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And did it go to legal?

659
01:15:51,244 --> 01:15:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sent to the administration.

660
01:15:52,565 --> 01:15:53,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't received a reply.

661
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:55,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

662
01:15:55,757 --> 01:15:58,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could re-request to go to legal or I could not.

663
01:15:58,359 --> 01:15:59,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already requested.

664
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:01,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okie dokie.

665
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:03,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a representative from the mayor's office here.

666
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:04,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

667
01:16:04,884 --> 01:16:08,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be in the committee report as it was in the records from the 16th.

668
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

669
01:16:09,688 --> 01:16:11,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Then keep it in committee.

670
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:12,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

671
01:16:14,212 --> 01:16:18,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, like... Keep it in committee and adjourn because I know we're late already for our next meeting.

672
01:16:18,716 --> 01:16:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

673
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:20,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really want to say that, like,

674
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:25,736
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't stop doing our jobs because the mayor doesn't hire a city solicitor.

675
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:30,499
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to pass laws to execute the policies we were elected to execute.

676
01:16:31,099 --> 01:16:40,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And my personal feeling on that is, especially when we have a law or a policy that another city right down the road is executing well,

677
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:43,330
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we can approve.

678
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:51,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we weren't coasting and drafting on the work of other communities because we don't have our act together.

679
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:55,194
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we need to have this policy in place.

680
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:56,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just my two cents.

681
01:16:58,015 --> 01:17:04,558
