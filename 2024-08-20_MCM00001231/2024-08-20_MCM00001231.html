    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=0.091">You</a>  know, I'd like to jump into the meeting and get going, because it looks like it's a full load. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=9.517">I</a>  looked at them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=10.298">I</a>  counted them up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=11.118">There</a>  are 32 cases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=13.98">We</a>  have 29 one-day requests and three, you know, one change of manager, change of officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=25.047">I</a>  think we should get cracking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=26.267">So</a>  let's jump into it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=29.288">And</a>  I see, Gary, you put two hours for a Zoom allotment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=35.39">So</a>  if anybody's not on, they can always catch up as we move along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=39.991">So</a>  is that all right, Bobby? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=41.932">Ben,</a>  you ready? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=43.232">Ready.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=43.532">OK,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=46.033">So,</a>  as always, we need to do some housekeeping items first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=52.018">We</a>  need to take a look at the minutes from the last meeting, just kind of review them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=57.341">And</a>  I'd need a motion to accept the minutes into the record, the legal record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=69.63">I</a>  was able to go over them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=72.152">They</a>  all look good to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=76.194">Yeah,</a>  there's no issues there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=77.975">How</a>  about yourself, Ben?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=79.657">Yeah,</a>  I was able to review them as well, and they look good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=84.4">And</a>  I would make a motion to approve them, if that's all right, if that's agreeable to you, Bob.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=91.045">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=92.346">I,</a>  too, agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=93.347">I</a>  reviewed them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=94.268">They're</a>  spot on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=95.849">Very</a>  nice, Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=96.91">Great</a>  work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=98.691">So,</a>  Bobby, are you going to second the motion? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=102.154">Yep,</a>  I'll second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=103.795">All</a>  right, very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=104.818">All</a>  in favor of accepting the minutes, say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=108.989">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=109.491">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=109.992">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=111.336">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=112.127">So</a>  we got that out of the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=115.529">As</a>  I was saying, for everybody that's attending, there is a full load. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=121.392">As</a>  I was saying, there are 32 cases, 29 are one-day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=127.195">What</a>  I'd like to do is I'd like to bat out of order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=130.997">I</a>  do this occasionally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=132.057">I</a>  guess it's chairman's prerogative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=134.679">But</a>  I want to take care of the 1359 associates, Simmeliner and Wegmans first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=141.662">And</a>  then we can tackle the 29 one-day requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=146.003">Ben,</a>  Bobby, you think that's wise to get those out of the way first?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=152.224">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=153.945">Yeah,</a>  that's fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=154.765">All</a>  right, cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=156.485">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=157.165">So</a>  let's jump into the 1359 associates first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=164.567">Who</a>  do we have on the Zoom representing 1359 associates?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=172.003">My</a>  name is Chris Watson. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=173.385">I'm</a>  the president of the 1359 Associates.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=175.608">Thank</a>  you, Chris.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=177.651">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=179.013">Chris,</a>  do you mind?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=181.837">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, Jack.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=184.42">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm here as well as the manager that will be taking place.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=188.281">Okay,</a>  and so I see the amendment for the change of manager application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=194.606">Can</a>  you see we, you know, we, with all these forms and documents, we always check for completeness. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=201.973">The</a>  3 commissioners were not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=204.695">so</a>  we don't, you know, if we see something in there that gets by us, but we're really looking for completeness. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=210.317">But</a>  also, if you don't mind, if you could tell us a little about the change of manager, I believe it's John Malcolm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=218.681">Could</a>  you give us a little background or history on Mr. Malcolm?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=226.445">Yeah,</a>  I've been a bartender off and on for the 30, 40 years now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=230.267">I</a>  worked in a bunch of different establishments throughout Somerville and Boston. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=234.475">I</a>  was a member of the 1359 for many years, stepped away to raise my children. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=239.637">I</a>  came back as a member and a worker a little over a year ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=244.278">And</a>  at that point, John Frazier, the bar manager, was ready to step down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=248.339">He's</a>  getting on in years, and it was a lot for him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=250.96">So</a>  Chris had asked me if I'd like to step in and take the position, and I happily agreed to do so.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=257.037">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=259.778">You</a>  know, I'm kind of scrolling through, I see the Cory check, I see your record of birth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=268.343">I</a>  don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=270.744">Bobby,</a>  Ben, anything of concern for this change of manager request?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=282.27">My</a>  experience, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=285.079">Sorry</a>  about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=286.24">No,</a>  no, go ahead, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=288.482">I</a>  just said, bartending experience?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=294.608">Yeah,</a>  I started bartending back in 1987 at a bar in Somerville and I stayed basically in Somerville for most of my bartending career and I spent a little bit of time at Faneuil Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=306.986">Oh,</a>  that's really that's really I've been away from the business for a good 6 or 8 years as far as working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=314.151">Yeah,</a>  but I've been with 3059 for a little over a year now.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=317.614">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=318.094">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=318.255">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=320.056">That's</a>  that's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=320.857">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=322.238">Jack.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=322.538">That's</a>  Verizon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=323.639">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=324.099">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=325.14">If</a>  I'm reading this correctly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=327.321">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=327.742">I</a>  retired from Verizon about 3 years ago.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=330.944">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=331.605">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=334.618">Bobby,</a>  anything on your mind, any questions, concerns? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=338.482">I've</a>  looked, I see the application, I see the Corey check, I see the entity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=344.527">Anything</a>  come to mind that we've kind of missed or overlooked?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=349.351">No,</a>  everything looks good to me, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=352.254">I</a>  don't have an issue with this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=455.527">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=456.287">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=461.13">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=461.951">Let's</a>  tackle Semolina.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=465.473">Hi,</a>  good afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=467.114">I'm</a>  attorney Mara Sheehan working with Semolina Kitchen, CJ Inc. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=472.816">And</a>  we're here because there was a hearing February 21st and the ABCC came back with an RNA letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=483.099">So</a>  it had a couple of items that we have corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=487.781">So</a>  the first one was there is no more pledge of stock in the transaction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=492.842">It's</a>  a pure promissory note. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=495.263">And</a>  that's exactly what they wanted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=498.144">The</a>  name of the new stockholder director was corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=505.527">It's</a>  Bruno de Oliveira Barbosa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=508.067">A</a>  few places it was off there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=511.529">We</a>  have corrected the formatting as well as the query request, the entity vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=519.1">And</a>  on the last item, working with Rose Egan at ABCC, there was an option to add a director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=528.264">So</a>  Bruno de Oliveira is also petitioning to add as a director and shareholder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=535.608">So</a>  I think the packet is complete and I would request that you recommend this favorably to the ABCC.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=543.817">Yeah,</a>  attorney, I thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=546.358">You</a>  checked off all the boxes there, and you have C, exhibits 2A, 2C. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=553.08">I</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=553.54">You</a>  made it very simple to follow all the way through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=559.281">Just</a>  about the change in director, Bobby Bend, is that something that can be piggybacked off the top of this, or do you think they have to come back for a change of director?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=580.879">May</a>  I add that I submitted a revised application and ABCC indicated that this was acceptable because he had been part of the petition for transfer of stock February 21st and so they felt comfortable with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=598.79">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=599.81">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=601.431">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=602.752">We</a>  can do the both at once, right?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=605.794">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I think I think that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=608.036">We</a>  get the change of director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=609.517">We</a>  could make it just conditioned upon maybe sees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=613.061">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=613.702">You</a>  know, when they when they review the final package.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=616.444">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=616.765">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=618.346">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=619.367">And</a>  can we just clarify that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=620.589">So</a>  that's a change of director on top of the sale.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=625.816">Yes,</a>  the issuance of stock, a transfer of stock, purchase of stock, and all of the stock documents are included within the packet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=634.423">And</a>  that was previously approved by you, not ABCC yet.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=639.708">Yeah,</a>  we just, there is some formatting questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=646.133">But</a>  yeah, it looks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=648.155">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=649.015">Looks</a>  good to me now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=650.577">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=652.678">Very</a>  good, then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=654.039">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=655.117">Yeah,</a>  I don't see any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=656.918">We</a>  need to take a vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=661.139">Let</a>  me just kind of look through.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=664.42">Before</a>  we do, Mr. Chairman, I just had a question on the change of director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=670.783">It</a>  didn't appear to be on the original one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=675.064">Did</a>  we get an edited copy with the change of director checked off on that box with us? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=685.601">Yes,</a>  you did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=687.382">You</a>  did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=687.742">You</a>  sent an edited one to Daria? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=690.063">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=690.643">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=692.064">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=692.504">Yeah,</a>  because I didn't, for some reason, I didn't see it in here.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=699.267">I'm</a>  seeing through the three versions of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=703.31">It</a>  was revised three times, so I'm wondering if- Okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=706.691">Director,</a>  exhibit seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=708.132">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=708.732">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=709.653">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=710.353">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=711.474">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=711.714">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=714.068">Bobby,</a>  Ben, you wanna make a motion?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=719.973">Bobby,</a>  do you wanna do this one?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=722.114">Yeah,</a>  I can do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=724.476">I'll</a>  make a motion to accept the changes in the edits of the previous change of manager and change of, I believe it was interest, stock interest, transfer of stock <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=744.449">And</a>  for the Semolina license, trying to get a location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=752.674">I</a>  don't have everything in front of me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=762.34">572</a>  Boston Ave, Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=764.841">It</a>  was for the issuance slash transfer stock, new stockholder, and change of director.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=778.068">Everything</a>  else looks fine to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=779.629">All</a>  of the stuff that the ABCC investigator was requesting, I spent a lot of time going over it, going into all the stuff that she was looking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=791.773">I</a>  was able to find everything and everything had been done by the attorney, so I don't have a problem with this at all.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=797.696">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=799.636">Good</a>  work, Councilor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=800.797">Okay,</a>  and I'll second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=804.317">by</a>  Commissioner Delfano. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=806.738">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=808.058">All</a>  in favor of moving the Semolina request forward to ABCC, say aye.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=836.295">Let's</a>  jump into the third one, Wegmans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=841.058">Who</a>  do we have? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=842.839">Attorney</a>  Devlin, are you there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=844.5">Who's</a>  representing Wegmans? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=846.261">Good</a>  afternoon, Chairman Elizabeth Pisano from Upton, Connell, and Devlin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=850.284">I'm</a>  calling in for Attorney Devlin this afternoon.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=853.126">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=854.467">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=858.619">Can</a>  you give us an overview? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=860.86">I</a>  see that Danny Wegman and Colleen Wegman, I see they're moving around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=865.883">I</a>  see there's a strong core now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=873.988">Wegman's</a>  there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=875.108">But</a>  give us an overview of what's transpiring, please, if you don't mind, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=879.771">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=880.511">So</a>  Wegman's is just changing their officers at the corporate level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=885.614">Steven</a>  Arsiel is retired and he's being removed and replaced by Aaron Hines as a secretary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=894.238">Matthew</a>  Daylor is going to be added as a director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=897.439">And</a>  Nicole Wegman has also been added as a senior VP and director of the parent company. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=906.903">So</a>  there are a couple of changes in the corporate structure, but there are no changes to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=914.587">to</a>  the restaurant space or the package store area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=918.771">Everything</a>  is going to remain exactly the same, operations exactly the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=922.415">It's</a>  just a corporate change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=926.179">Thank</a>  you for that Councilor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=928.942">Also</a>  just one thing to know, we realized that we were missing one page of the ABCC application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=938.439">Matthew</a>  Daler was inadvertently left off of section six of the proposed officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=944.445">So</a>  if you don't mind, I'm just going to send you an amended page that you can just remove and replace before you send it to the ABCC.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=953.927">Hey,</a>  not only that, but, you know, I noticed that the Corey applications and then we're supposed to provide proof of citizenship. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=966.375">And</a>  I think I think we were missing some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=972.215">I</a>  believe we were missing, like if we match up the proof of citizenship with the Corey records, they don't match up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=979.562">I</a>  think we're, we might be two or three short. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=982.605">Is</a>  that what you're referring to, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=984.987">No,</a>  the ABCC only requires a majority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=988.39">So</a>  you don't need to show everyone's proof of US citizenship, just only the amount that shows the majority.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=995.523">Okay,</a>  so the proof of citizenship doesn't have to match up with the CORI applications? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1002.449">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1003.35">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1003.75">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1004.971">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1006.512">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1006.993">That</a>  was the only thing that jumped out at me when I reviewed the package. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1010.515">I</a>  just wasn't sure whether those two... Again, we're not lawyers, but our job is to make sure the package is complete. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1019.183">So</a>  when it gets to ABCC, they don't go, what are they, morons down there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1024.947">No,</a>  but that's why I'm going to send you an amended page just for you to replace. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1030.85">We</a>  made one mistake and need to just add somebody in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1034.011">He's</a>  in the description. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1034.971">You</a>  have his query of all of his information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1037.252">His</a>  name was just left off of page two.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1040.894">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1041.294">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1041.594">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1041.914">It</a>  sounds like you're way ahead of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1043.475">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1044.856">I</a>  didn't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1045.996">Bobby,</a>  Ben, anything come to mind?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1050.918">I</a>  have a simple question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1052.699">There's</a>  these two packages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1055.143">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1057.125">And</a>  what is the difference on it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1061.168">I'm</a>  just trying to make sure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1062.569">So</a>  one of them is for, there's two separate licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1065.372">One</a>  of them is for the on-premise license and the other one is for the on-premise package store license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1070.276">So</a>  they're just two different ones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1071.557">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1072.117">You</a>  have to change both.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1073.758">No,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1074.339">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1076.761">That's</a>  why there's these two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1078.082">They</a>  look so similar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1079.443">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1079.743">I</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1080.104">They</a>  look the exact same.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1081.465">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1081.905">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1082.506">That</a>  makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1089.95">The</a>  only thing that I saw with these were the certificate of compliance for the Department of Unemployment Assistance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1100.796">They're</a>  both expired and they're only good for like 30 days when you get these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1105.178">So</a>  if you can possibly just grab an updated one for both the licenses, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1114.817">that's</a>  required, I'm just looking at one of them here, one of the licenses, but if you can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1121.596">I</a>  don't have a problem okaying this with the expired DUA thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1125.359">It's</a>  just that once you get it, just send a copy so we can update our records. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1129.563">Yep,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1130.263">The</a>  ABCC typically takes them up to 90 days, even though the expiration date isn't 30, they usually accept it within 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1138.511">But</a>  we have requested this from our client just in case ABCC doesn't get to it, you know, before June to review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1145.036">So</a>  as soon as we get updated ones, we're happy to send it to your board.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1148.759">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1153.632">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1155.434">Bobby,</a>  Ben, you want to make a motion to move this forward?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1161.019">Yeah,</a>  I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1161.9">I</a>  can make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1167.956">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1168.917">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1169.977">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1170.617">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1170.998">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1171.238">After</a>  reviewing both of those applications, um, I'll make a motion to approve the application for the change of officer or the package store and the second application for the change of officer for the restaurant at Wegmans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1194.55">Um,</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1196.731">Wigman's,</a>  Massachusetts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1199.613">3850</a>  Misty Valley Parkway.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1201.655">Yeah,</a>  3850 Misty Valley Parkway.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1205.278">And</a>  I second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1208.16">Thank</a>  you, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1208.881">Thank</a>  you, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1210.022">All</a>  in favor, accept in the change of officers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1214.366">Motion,</a>  say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1216.687">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1217.548">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1218.829">Council,</a>  you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1220.37">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1220.911">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1222.412">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1223.033">Take</a>  care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1223.513">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1224.194">Have</a>  a good one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1225.375">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1230.977">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1234.298">I</a>  think they're, if I added correctly, there are 29 one-day license requests.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1242.86">I</a>  don't think I see that many. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1244.18">Unless</a>  I missed some of them.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1247.061">No,</a>  I think Alan is counting like how many we got from Medford Brewing and how many we got from Winter Hill Brewing.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1254.162">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1259.266">Well,</a>  maybe I'm just counting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1261.267">Insurance.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1263.009">Insurance.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1263.929">Oh,</a>  that too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1264.509">Yes,</a>  yes, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1266.15">Yeah,</a>  seven and seven from what I can see.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1269.012">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1269.673">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1270.413">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1271.554">So,</a>  I guess let's jump to the one-day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1277.878">Do</a>  we have... Mr. Bailey, are you on with us?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1283.501">I'm</a>  here, Robert Holdredge, representing Winter Hill Brewing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1287.117">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1288.958">So</a>  if you don't mind, just kind of give us an overview. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1291.92">We're</a>  very familiar with the entity and you guys run a nice shop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1296.743">You</a>  have your tip certified bartenders. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1300.405">You</a>  guys run a great operation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1302.867">Just</a>  kind of give us an overview of what's happening and what the requests are for, if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1309.151">So</a>  I think there was seven dates he requested. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1311.552">Do</a>  you want me to list them all?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1315.201">Yeah,</a>  so we can just kind of get them on to public record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1318.082">I</a>  know it's not sure if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1320.543">So</a>  June 6, June 27, July 25, August 1, August 15, and October 3 and 17.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1339.251">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1340.973">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1342.054">And</a>  so, yeah, like 4 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1345.276">I</a>  mean, generally we wrap up a little earlier than 8 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1348.259">as</a>  business dictates, but, you know, we have two TIPS certified employees, wristbanding everyone, IDing everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1357.247">I</a>  think this is our third or fourth year doing this, so.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1363.933">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1364.854">Tell</a>  me, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1366.78">You</a>  know, I was going through the insurance policy, and I don't know if I'm missing something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1373.528">It</a>  looked like you had policy dates, but it looked like August 15th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1382.038">was</a>  missing from one of the master policies, or is there another policy I'm not aware of? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1389.741">I</a>  see all the dates, you know, the 26th, the 25th, July 20th, but I don't see something for August 15th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1397.145">Am</a>  I just missing it?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1399.086">No,</a>  you was missing, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1401.347">I</a>  found the same thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1403.067">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1404.788">Okay,</a>  I'll have to get my partner on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1407.509">He</a>  kind of handles all the insurance stuff, but I'll make note of that.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1412.076">Yeah,</a>  it's an easy fix. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1414.397">Like</a>  I said, we're very familiar with the operation where we see that the event's going to be down at the condom shell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1420.458">But</a>  I guess we could make this, I'm just kind of thinking out loud, if we could just approve this with the condition that the insurance gets, the event on August 15th get added to the insurance coverage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1437.701">Sure,</a>  yeah, we'll get right on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1439.762">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1440.76">Then,</a>  Bobby, do you want to make a motion?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1445.464">We</a>  got one other issue that I can spot too, Mr. Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1449.406">I</a>  didn't notice it till just now when this gentleman reviewed the dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1455.991">The</a>  6-27 date is on page two of his documentation with the layout of the condon shell along with the other dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1469.586">The</a>  actual application is for 6-25. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1473.607">I'm</a>  just wondering what the correct date is, 6-25 or 6-27. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1476.728">Our</a>  paperwork says 6-25.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1479.789">Well,</a>  6-25 is a Tuesday, so it has to be 6-27, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1485.991">The</a>  farmers market's on Thursdays.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1489.592">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1490.272">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1492.173">OK,</a>  so we can correct that and make it 6-27. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1497.215">That</a>  is the correct date.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1499.502">Okay,</a>  that yeah, so I think you just you update the policy, because it's also 625 on the policy, so you just update the policy with all the correct dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1512.088">Okay,</a>  okay well with the additional date, and then you can correct that date.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1516.69">Yeah,</a>  so the 27th has got to be in there, and then August 15th has got to be in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1522.592">Okay,</a>  I'll have them fix that today.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1525.954">And</a>  Gary, you can, if you wouldn't mind, you just update our copy of the one day license, just change it to the 27. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1533.576">So</a>  we know for our records.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1536.056">Yes,</a>  we'll do.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1537.717">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1543.098">As</a>  always, great job by you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1545.699">The</a>  pictures, the layout, everything's perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1549.32">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1550.52">Thanks</a>  for having us again.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1552.174">So</a>  let's make a motion to move forward with the, what is it, seven? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1558.676">One,</a>  two, three, seven of them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1559.997">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1561.757">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1562.697">Where</a>  it is correct is on that packet, you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1565.378">That's</a>  a nice packet you gave us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1567.999">That's</a>  actually, all the dates are right there, I think.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1570.82">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1571.86">So</a>  that's what I was looking at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1574.621">I</a>  didn't catch that they were off on the other one.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1577.883">No,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1578.943">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1581.184">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1582.284">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1585.904">But</a>  yeah, I can make a motion or Bob. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1590.745">I'll</a>  make the motion if you like.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1594.046">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve the seven one day licenses with a contingent upon a correction from a <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1606.39">with</a>  the new insurance coverage page, inserting the date for August 15th, 2024, which is missing, and also correcting the date on the insurance coverage page from June 25th to June 27th, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1622.116">And</a>  the dates we are approving are June 6th, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1633.062">June</a>  27th, July 25th, August 1st, August 15th, October 3rd, October 17th for a beer garden at the Condon show for the Winter Hill Growing Company.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1652.292">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1654.894">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1655.674">Thank</a>  you for the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1656.575">Thank</a>  you for the second, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1658.195">All</a>  in favor of moving forward with a one-day license request for Winter Hill, say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1663.965">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1664.666">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1666.066">You're</a>  all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1667.067">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1668.328">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1669.769">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1670.829">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1671.21">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1672.31">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1675.872">That's</a>  it here at the Bear Garden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1678.794">Want</a>  to do Medford Pride Day? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1680.695">We'll</a>  jump to that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1684.818">That</a>  Medford Brewery. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1685.878">Let</a>  me see here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1687.86">How</a>  many are Medford Brewery? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1690.381">There's</a>  seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1694.051">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1696.993">Next</a>  seven, OK.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1698.854">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1699.835">So</a>  actually, before we do start, I actually have another quick question for you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1706.86">We</a>  are doing a, we did it last year, where we're sponsoring the Dave McGill for a Run Medford run. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1718.828">And</a>  so we're sponsoring their beer garden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1721.952">and</a>  I haven't included it on one of the permit applications, because my memory is a bit fuddled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1727.595">As</a>  it's not a paid thing, we're basically just donating this product through them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1732.638">Do</a>  I need to get a one-day permit for that as well?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1741.403">Are</a>  you going to be charging for the bid?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1745.465">No,</a>  it's all a giveaway.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1751.933">Well,</a>  it's open to the public and it's a paid admission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1758.514">Is</a>  there a paid admission to run the race? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1761.075">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1764.675">And</a>  is it on public property?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1768.676">I</a>  think, and I may be wrong because I move it around, I think they might be ending it at City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1775.037">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1777.478">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1777.938">And</a>  is this a non-profit as well? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1782.353">Uh,</a>  I, those are the questions that might make a difference if it's an idea.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1790.557">Sorry,</a>  I don't mean to interrupt, but I believe they are nonprofit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1793.398">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1794.958">I</a>  think Dave said something to me last year stating that they're nonprofit.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1801.081">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to throw this stuff in and I can get you the CLI and stuff anyway, just for good measure, but I don't have it on me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1808.224">It</a>  was just a,</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1810.965">Yeah,</a>  I guess I'd like to err on the cautious side and say, yeah, you'll have to request one day just to cover ourselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1819.148">I</a>  guess, Bobby, maybe this is something we can look into so we'll be ready for it next year when you pose the question again.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1825.77">I</a>  mean, basically, other than insurance, there'd probably be no cost to Nick other than the product they're donating, obviously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1840.321">and</a>  the money that you'd be putting out for insurance, everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1844.883">I</a>  mean, there's no charge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1846.323">They're</a>  not charging for the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1848.604">So</a>  I don't really think there's an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1852.806">We</a>  can issue a one-day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1854.786">There's</a>  no charge where it's a nonprofit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1857.047">So</a>  it's kind of like, why not get it?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1859.868">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1860.869">CYA,</a>  and we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1862.95">Right,</a>  because it's out in public.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1866.711">Yeah,</a>  just in case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1868.051">Just</a>  in case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1870.756">My</a>  gut is that you would get it because whether you're donating or charging it, to us it's like if we're looking out for the liquor consumption around the city, I think it's the exact same kind of thing for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1883.934">We</a>  would just as well have it.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1888.643">Okay,</a>  can I make your second slightly dodgy request, which feel free to say no, stop it, Nick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1896.424">Can</a>  I add that to my list and then send you all the paperwork tomorrow so I don't have to bother you again so soon with a few of my things? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1909.367">I</a>  mean, if that's not cool, there's no worries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1912.047">I</a>  can just put them to another agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1913.628">For</a>  just that one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1916.382">Oh,</a>  it's not until September the 27th, 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1919.523">We</a>  got plenty of time.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1923.465">Yeah,</a>  we got plenty of time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1924.885">We'll</a>  be back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1925.526">I</a>  mean, we take, you know, traditionally or historically, we take the summer off, but we'll be back in September, definitely.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1935.17">Yeah,</a>  you can submit it September, whatever the third Wednesday is in September, up until then, you know?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1941.352">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1941.852">Yeah,</a>  no, it wasn't just to lighten loads somewhere, but yeah, I can do that.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1946.628">Also,</a>  just kind of why we do have another meeting in June.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1951.37">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1951.63">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1952.311">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1953.011">July</a>  and August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1954.532">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1955.472">July</a>  and August will take off.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1957.253">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1990.281">I've</a>  been a good boy this week, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1994.903">He's</a>  all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1998.204">It's</a>  a small world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=1999.705">Yeah,</a>  it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2000.565">It's</a>  a small city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2002.646">Oh,</a>  yes, it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2006.332">OK,</a>  so I think that the tweets added in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2013.298">And</a>  I think we're good now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2017.001">Any</a>  other questions, concerns from anyone on this?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2020.925">We</a>  just have four for the show. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2022.826">If</a>  you want, maybe we can look over the four or approve the four all at once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2028.111">And</a>  then the other three are different locations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2030.993">So</a>  we might have to do them one at a time.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2034.656">Yeah,</a>  that's the concert, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2037.617">Those</a>  were the dates for the concert?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2039.798">Yes,</a>  yeah, the Farmers Market concert. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2041.539">So</a>  same place as usual, same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2043.8">We'll</a>  do the signs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2045.401">And</a>  yes, and the same thing actually with, I think I put one in for the, it's the same sort of thing for the pizza festival. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2055.146">Is</a>  that, did I include that one?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2057.267">Yeah,</a>  the Italian, yes, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2059.928">I</a>  think we, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2063.374">which,</a>  as far as I know, that's also being put on pretty much by the Farmer's Market gang, so we'll go in the same spot for that as well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2070.958">All</a>  right, is that the Italian Festival June 2nd you're referring to, Nick?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2076.962">No,</a>  that's different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2077.822">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2078.863">No,</a>  I think it might be different, actually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2080.844">It's</a>  different, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2081.945">OK,</a>  I'm mixing them up.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2083.366">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2084.086">My</a>  bad.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2084.726">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2086.227">Yeah,</a>  I haven't managed to corner that one yet.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2093.205">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2094.206">Yeah,</a>  no, that one's different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2095.847">Yeah,</a>  that's coming up later today.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2103.812">Okay,</a>  so we're going to add the concert ones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2108.495">What</a>  is it, September 12th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2109.936">Well,</a>  June 20th, July 18th, and September 12th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2116.52">Those</a>  are the three for the concert dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2119.892">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2121.673">September</a>  12th, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2123.294">And</a>  there's a jazz festival too, right?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2125.274">824,</a>  same location?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2133.338">And</a>  we can kind of throw those all on the same one, if you like, Mr. Chairman, that they're all on the same location.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2140.101">Yeah,</a>  it's all the same location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2141.502">It's</a>  all the same vendor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2143.402">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2172.649">Good,</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2241.692">Yeah,</a>  we got three more for Nick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=2243.673">We</a>  already did the seven for winter health.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3204.937">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3206.858">Thank</a>  you, Dan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3207.938">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3214.357">I</a>  remember it last year, I brought my son by there and it was fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3219.221">It</a>  was inside and it was where the Y is, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3224.566">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3225.107">We</a>  made the best of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3226.488">We</a>  still had some food vendors that roughed it out outside and it worked out well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3232.874">There's</a>  a lot of people though, so outside will be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3237.298">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3238.58">I,</a>  I see the 1 day license request diary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3242.184">Is</a>  there something I'm missing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3243.526">Do</a>  we have the insurance for it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3246.089">Or</a>  do we have a little diagram or a layout of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3249.333">Of</a>  where the events taking place didn't have any have those 2 items been submitted.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3254.639">So,</a>  the, the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3258.006">The</a>  layout I submitted to diary a little earlier, uh, right before the meeting, actually, uh, it's the same layout that we used last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3264.889">We're</a>  going to be right adjacent to the show. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3267.25">There's</a>  going to be a cordoned off area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3269.191">Um,</a>  you know, roped off clearly roped off area for the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3275.293">Um,</a>  and it is not to leave that area obviously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3278.134">Um,</a>  and as far as the insurance rider, I'm waiting literally for an email right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3285.117">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3287.482">from</a>  my insurance, from our insurance company, with the coverage, which I also can get to Daria, which she can forward it to you, I'd say within the hour.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3298.289">Terrific.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3299.069">Terrific,</a>  Dan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3299.749">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3301.49">This</a>  drawing is the back of the pizza box one from last year.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3306.794">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3307.134">I</a>  remember that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3310.736">It's</a>  pretty good, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3313.217">It</a>  was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3315.955">You</a>  got the straight line in the box. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3317.856">You</a>  can follow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3319.397">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3322.459">Maybe</a>  next year when we can see a little better after this successful year, I can actually, you know what, I have to create one for, for the food vendors anyways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3331.664">So</a>  I'm actually, I'll, I'll get a Google earth one and get that out to you before the, you know, within a week or before the event.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3339.188">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3340.068">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3344.684">I</a>  have one question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3347.686">You</a>  folks realize that this is wine and malt only, not all alcohol, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3353.51">Only</a>  because in order to have an all alcohol, you have to be a nonprofit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3359.134">And</a>  it's not a nonprofit event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3363.076">So</a>  it's just going to be wine and malt.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3371.602">And</a>  then Sage, you're with the Ford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3374.301">Yes,</a>  I am.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3375.342">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3375.722">And</a>  so you guys are doing this event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3377.463">You</a>  guys are providing the tip certified bartender and everything.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3381.687">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3382.467">I</a>  am tip certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3383.368">I</a>  will be present doing all that good stuff.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3387.191">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3389.933">And</a>  are you guys setting up the section where the alcohol is going to be distributed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3399.144">Yeah,</a>  correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3399.905">We're</a>  going to have it sectioned off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3401.366">So</a>  and we'll have signs put up no alcohol outside these premises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3404.708">So</a>  they'll stay within that section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3406.27">So</a>  no alcohol will leave that area.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3409.472">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3412.735">Yeah,</a>  you know, really what it is, you still want people wandering off, you know, like with a drink in their hand, just so it stays contained.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3419.28">So</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3420.421">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3424.884">I</a>  think we, we picked up the little nuances in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3429.828">Anything</a>  else, Bobby, Ben, anything else jump out at you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3434.212">No,</a>  everything looks great to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3436.614">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3437.475">Daniel,</a>  you're aware of the nonprofit versus the corporation rules, correct?</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3444.701">Yes,</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3445.482">I</a>  just want to make sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3447.323">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3554.61">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3554.831">So</a>  we have one more from Alvaro for Alta Cuba. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3559.755">I</a>  sent it, I think, 1220-ish. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3561.716">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3565.92">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3567.762">So</a>  as you guys got the email that I forwarded from the mayor, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3575.468">stating</a>  pretty much KP law told us that it's up to the city how we want to approach a lot of dining with liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3583.368">And</a>  the mayor is, of course, in support of outdoor dining room liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3589.632">So</a>  it's up to us on how we want to handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3592.494">That's</a>  why I was trying to get you guys' input before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3595.677">And</a>  Alvaro has been asking me about it for some time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3598.699">So</a>  I wanted to get him on to just get it done for him if we just want to continue to do with the way we've done it for the past couple of years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3609.073">So</a>  yeah, because we also have Oasis that has reached out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3613.674">But</a>  I did call Oasis, but I didn't hear back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3619.416">And</a>  I'm not in the office today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3620.696">So</a>  maybe he did call me back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3622.096">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3625.897">Well,</a>  my only concern is as long as it's a dedicated area, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3633.221">As</a>  long as it's a dedicated space to serve, I think I would be fine with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3641.246">I'm</a>  happy that the mayor is all for it to keep the city moving and the city being vibrant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3648.931">Anything,</a>  Bobby, Ben, anything jump out at you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3652.213">Any</a>  concerns or additions to making sure the serving area is sectioned off?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3664.677">There's</a>  no drawing of it, right?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3671.881">Alvaro?</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3674.982">I</a>  can't hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3679.224">You're</a>  on mute, Alvaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3683.846">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3685.027">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3686.828">Well,</a>  I sent the print how it will be set up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3691.743">And</a>  it's basically what we use the same way as what we did in the notch previous years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3697.026">And</a>  then in two years in a row, we were able to get alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3700.307">In</a>  this case, we're asking also part of the drawing is to have some on the sidewalk because it's a wider sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3708.672">But</a>  that's pretty much all on the outdoor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3711.213">So</a>  I don't know if there is anything that needs to be required to keep the people more enclosed.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3724.299">Yeah,</a>  yeah, did you actually send it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3726.239">So</a>  no, I mean, I was thinking about it, because you have to knock and that's a notch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3730.1">And</a>  then that's all good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3732.841">I</a>  mean, really, I'm just speaking for myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3735.021">I</a>  have no problem with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3736.961">Obviously,</a>  you're doing a great job at that restaurant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3739.722">It's</a>  a very successful restaurant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3741.562">So</a>  I have no problem with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3745.203">But</a>  assuming all the other boards in the city, OK, I'm sure you have to sort of submit some kind of plan to them.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3753.05">Yes,</a>  that is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3754.271">So</a>  everybody still has to go through outdoor dining commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3760.852">And</a>  part of it, so PDS is a part of it, building, fire, engineering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3768.6">So</a>  everybody does work together still. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3771.302">It's</a>  just we're waiting on the alcohol part. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3774.686">And</a>  as you guys know, they just approved it May, like the first week of May, the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3781.793">So</a>  we don't.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3785.056">We.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3785.807">We've</a>  been approved, and I have the permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3789.79">But</a>  if we don't get approved for people can drink outside, it makes no sense for us financially to actually do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3799.056">So</a>  that's what we're waiting in order to actually build and do what we want to do in front of the place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3805.74">But</a>  until then, we're just going to be pending.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3810.083">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3811.09">Yeah,</a>  no, I get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3813.171">Actually,</a>  I was going to say, I think of the great American Bear Hall where there was nothing there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3820.256">There</a>  was nothing there, but we said, OK, as long as the conditions that the city puts down, I think we'd be fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3830.863">So</a>  in this case, Navarre, you're saying that the city's already looked at your plans and they're fine with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3839.788">I</a>  kind of echo Ben's sentiment that I'm fine with the two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3844.089">Anything</a>  to keep the city vibrant as long as we're minimizing the risk to the owner and the city, I'm good with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3853.871">How</a>  about you, Bobby?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3854.732">Yeah,</a>  I did some research on this and I really dug into those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3866.109">emails</a>  that Daria sent us about the new ABCC rules and the governor signing that this is going to be up to the local licensing authority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3881.438">It</a>  made it an act making appropriations for fiscal year 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3884.98">And</a>  what it is is <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3890.582">Basically</a>  in a nutshell, it's the same exact thing as we've been doing since COVID in 2020. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3898.124">The</a>  city has got its own rules that the licensee has to abide by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3907.387">The</a>  only difference is the ABCC come up with a new form, which I'm trying to put my hands on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3915.809">It's</a>  a licensing authority certification form <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3920.49">One</a>  pager, and any licensee in the city can fill this out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3925.932">It's</a>  no charge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3928.333">They've</a>  added an additional box to the top with all the boxes, change of office, ownership, interest, change of manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3934.756">They</a>  put outdoor only alteration of premise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3939.078">That</a>  needs to be checked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3941.719">And</a>  you need to put the licensee's information in with a complete description of the license premise, inside and outside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3951.723">And</a>  as soon as they do that, we approve it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3957.086">And</a>  as long as they're abiding by the outdoor dining commission regulations, we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3966.731">They</a>  can have outdoor alcohol just like they've had the past three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3972.514">Only</a>  the ABCC doesn't get involved in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3976.216">It's</a>  strictly turned over to us now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3978.99">The</a>  only thing Daria has to do is once these forms are filled out, they have, she has to send it through the portal to the ABCC to inform them of who is doing alcohol outdoors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3992.752">And</a>  this is going to continue from this point forward every year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=3997.273">Um,</a>  you know, every year you'll just have to fill out this form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4001.694">It's</a>  the licensing authority certification form and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4008.356">That's</a>  giving our approval to allow you to sell alcohol outdoors as long as you're complying with the Outdoor Dining Commission rules. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4020.062">There's</a>  probably going to be an easy way to do it or a hard way to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4024.144">The</a>  hard way to do it would have you fill out these forms and bring it before us to approve each and every one of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4032.668">The</a>  easy way to do it, and I was going to suggest to my fellow commissioners, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4037.315">is</a>  that we had just adopt the ABCC and governor's new ruling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4044.541">And</a>  basically all that does is we can make it citywide that when Daria receives one of these forms, she can grant the outdoor dining license as long as the licensee has complied with the outdoor dining commission rules. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4064.468">So</a>  each one doesn't have to come to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4067.17">We're</a>  just gonna approve it on a blanket type approval that anybody that fills out this form is good to go as long as they're complying with the Outdoor Dining Commission rules. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4078.179">That's</a>  the way I think it'd be the easiest.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4080.701">That</a>  sounds much easier.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4083.543">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4084.484">It's</a>  like adopting a new law or whatever, you know, it's just, because obviously, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4090.298">These,</a>  they can't, everybody can't get all their forms in and then have to wait until the end of our meeting in June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4098.642">It's</a>  just gonna be too crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4101.143">It</a>  wouldn't be able to work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4103.424">So</a>  if we just say, anybody that wants it or inquires about it, or wants to do alcohol outside, fill out the licensing authority certification form, and you got it, as long as you're compliant.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4116.375">So</a>  I don't know how you guys feel about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4119.076">Yeah,</a>  no, I think it's efficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4122.556">It's</a>  clean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4123.157">I</a>  like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4125.277">I</a>  like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4126.857">It's</a>  smart.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4128.298">Dario,</a>  does that work for you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4130.298">I</a>  mean, would that also make it a little more streamlined for you as well?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4136.0">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4137.26">And</a>  you're talking about that form that I usually fill out, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4140.901">The</a>  local licensing decree?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4143.277">It</a>  was the form that was attached to those documents from the ABCC regarding the outdoor dining and the cocktails to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4154.323">That's</a>  the one that they want you to return a copy to them once it's completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4162.308">It's</a>  basically, it has one, two, three boxes along besides all the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4170.248">things</a>  on the top that you change your license type, change it, transfer a license, whatever you want to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4175.79">But</a>  it's got to be outdoor only alteration of premise has got to be checked off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4181.032">The</a>  applicant's information, it's just their licensee, DBA, street address, manager, type, class, and category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4189.215">And</a>  then they've got to put a complete description of the premise indoor and outdoor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4194.578">The</a>  box below it <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4196.117">It</a>  says local licensing authority information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4200.08">Advertised,</a>  yes or no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4201.541">They</a>  don't have to advertise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4202.921">So</a>  it's just a no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4204.042">Just</a>  check off the box, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4205.643">About</a>  as notified, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4207.424">Because</a>  they already have their alcohol license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4211.707">And</a>  then date approved by the LLA, if all their paperwork is in order and they present this application to you, that's the date it's approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4223.335">Because</a>  it's, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4226.979">We're</a>  approving all of these as long as they're in compliance with the outdoor diving commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4232.4">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4234.101">How</a>  long it would take that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4235.201">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4237.922">Because</a>  how long it will take this process? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4241.783">I</a>  called the ABCC prior and then we couldn't get an answer from them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4245.463">The</a>  explanation they gave me is once they go into the authorities, it will be like basically the previous years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4253.027">And</a>  on the previous year, I remember I never submitted any, once I have an approval of the inside of the space, now I have to do a description of the inside and outside, even though that I'm only doing alteration of the outside because I never had it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4269.176">It's</a>  just to see how, on the timeframe, how long it would take me to actually do this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4276.624">Well,</a>  let me ask you a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4278.926">Are</a>  you approved for the outdoor dining commission already?</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4284.069">Do</a>  you have compliance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4286.771">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4287.131">I</a>  just say that I have a permit already in place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4290.594">The</a>  only thing is that we don't do the build out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4293.076">It's</a>  because if we are not OK to sell alcohol, it makes no sense for us financially to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4301.041">So</a>  that's the only reason we haven't done it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4303.543">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4304.023">No,</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4305.945">And</a>  if the commission approves, Mr. Chairman, he can come to city hall today and pick up his form, fill it out, and he's good to go tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4317.833">Three</a>  more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4320.455">Avaro,</a>  get that form filled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4324.177">My</a>  thought is, since you've already meet the criteria for the city, we're OK with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4330.021">Just</a>  complete that form, get it back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4333.243">And</a>  I think you're good to go, unless I'm missing something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4337.046">Bobby,</a>  Ben, am I missing something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4339.709">He's</a>  already been approved by the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4341.35">Yeah,</a>  the city's OK with it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4343.392">Yeah,</a>  we're good with it.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4345.253">So</a>  just an FYI, the mayor just said it's up to the Liquor Commission on how we want to handle it, if we want to do a bonus notification or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4354.921">So</a>  just passing it along, just a messenger.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4361.175">Yeah,</a>  I mean, if there's no need for a butters notification, why put the licensee for that?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4366.298">Yeah,</a>  and that's that's what I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4368.139">So</a>  we did that before we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4370.801">Well,</a>  we have to do it when there's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4374.209">When</a>  there's an official alteration of premises, right, we do have to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4377.811">When</a>  Medford Brewing had to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4379.712">But</a>  just my two cents in, you guys don't need my input, but just my chain of thought on this is that we're only doing this from April 1st to October 1st, I believe, is the season of outdoor dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4394.819">So</a>  it's not, you know, where you do it at all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4399.856">I</a>  just don't know if we should be doing this case by case because some places, Alvaro's place is not in residential, it's just business area, but some are more in residential area, so I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4415.224">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4416.525">My</a>  thought on that, Daria, is it wasn't required for the past four years since COVID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4422.728">So</a>  according to the ABCC, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4427.043">And</a>  in the email from the governor's office, it's to follow the 2022 rule, I believe it says, that was put out from the governor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4439.375">On</a>  April 7, 2022, the ABCC approved guidelines for outdoor alcoholic beverage service areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4447.843">And</a>  that's what we've been following. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4450.621">And</a>  it doesn't require a notification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4453.423">You're</a>  100% right if they're doing an alteration of premises, absolutely it needs it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4459.108">But</a>  for this, no, it doesn't need it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4461.91">So</a>  that's why in those boxes, advertise, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4465.914">About</a>  a notify, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4469.317">And</a>  then, you know, we're good to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4472.119">I</a>  mean, he can come today and pick up this form from you <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4476.536">or</a>  you can email it to him, he can fill it out and bring it to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4479.117">As</a>  soon as he brings it to you, there's no charge, he's good to go.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4483.238">Yeah,</a>  I can send it to Omar because I'm not, I'm out till Monday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4488.18">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4489.8">I</a>  mean, if you want, I can email him one, do you want to, well, that's right, you know, I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4494.762">Yeah,</a>  email would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4497.603">I</a>  can email it to you, fill it out and email it back to Daria and you're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4504.625">Yeah,</a>  he'll be all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4506.46">And</a>  then if she's got to fill out a little something when she gets back from vacation, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4511.742">You</a>  know, we can do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4512.622">That</a>  is as long as it's okay with my fellow commissioners.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4517.083">I</a>  like to, like I said, it's clean, it's smart, it's efficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4523.165">You're</a>  right, Bobby, we're kind of following the rules from COVID 2020 going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4528.667">So</a>  I'm good with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4531.488">Just</a>  as long as he completes that form and gets it back to us so we have it for record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4536.692">I</a>  think we should be fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4538.954">Yeah,</a>  and you know, you feel bad for these fellows too because they've already lost a month and a half. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4544.939">This</a>  is usually April first, you know, and I don't know whether the governor dragged their feet on it or what happened, but you know, all these restaurants in the whole state lost a month, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4557.409">Yeah,</a>  so.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4558.35">Just</a>  let them do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4559.951">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4561.212">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4563.189">Yeah,</a>  so time is of the essence, Alvaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4566.01">Get</a>  that form, get it back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4568.45">And</a>  like I said, best of luck.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4571.511">Alvaro,</a>  do you want to give me your email address and I'll send it to you?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4574.972">I'm</a>  sending it to him, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4576.413">I'm</a>  doing it.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4576.913">Oh,</a>  you are? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4577.693">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4577.953">I</a>  didn't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4578.753">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4578.913">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4579.053">Well,</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4582.834">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4585.275">You're</a>  welcome, Alvaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4586.335">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4587.996">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4590.897">Daria,</a>  anything else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4592.615">Do</a>  we have to put this in a form of a motion, the way we're handling it, or no?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4597.536">I</a>  think so, just to have it there in minutes and officially that you guys discussed this and this is the way you want to handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4606.397">I</a>  think that would be a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4608.038">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4609.998">That</a>  way it's on record that we discussed it and we voted on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4613.619">So</a>  Bobby, if you don't mind making that, I know you explained it very well, if you mind giving us a little narrative again and we can vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4622.856">Yeah,</a>  I'll make the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4625.838">I'll</a>  make the motion from this point forward, May 15, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4631.542">We</a>  are to follow the guidelines of the ABCC for outdoor only alteration of premise licenses on an annual basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4648.165">from,</a>  Daria, I think you said April 1st to October 31st.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4652.829">I</a>  believe, yeah, I can check the dates with the outdoor dining people.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4660.175">Yep,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4662.537">For</a>  those dates, pending the licensee is in full compliance with the Outdoor Dining Commission, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4676.993">and</a>  a licensing authority certification form has been completed and turned in to the local licensing authority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4687.979">There</a>  will be automatic approval if that is the case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4693.542">I</a>  think I didn't leave anything out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4694.863">I</a>  think I got it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4695.724">Can</a>  we reference to CUBA here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4699.866">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4700.966">Can</a>  we reference to CUBA specifically though?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4704.625">It's</a>  for any licensee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4706.826">This</a>  is just in general. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4708.187">Any</a>  licensee.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4712.83">Then</a>  if he submits that, then we can OK it then.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4716.592">Is</a>  that what you're saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4720.535">As</a>  soon as we receive this license application, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4725.587">then</a>  he's good to go.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4727.488">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4728.449">So</a>  that's what that's OK.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4729.63">So,</a>  yeah, we're getting the motion and then we'll vote on the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4733.532">And</a>  now it's the record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4735.113">And</a>  then he'll get the stuff to us later on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4737.414">So</a>  I'll second that motion that Bob said.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4744.399">OK,</a>  one further thing, you think that we should put some language in there that upon proof of outdoor dining commission <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4754.906">compliance,</a>  this license will be granted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4760.128">Because</a>  anybody can come to us and say, yeah, remote that they said I could do it now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4764.73">You</a>  know, I'll just give you this farm and I'll start selling the liquor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4767.631">Well,</a>  we don't know if he's been officially approved because <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4772.323">We</a>  have to see some paperwork from somebody.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4776.868">It's</a>  a two-part verification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4778.59">We</a>  need the form, and then we need the outdoor dining commission to approve this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4785.497">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4785.737">They</a>  must have some kind of certificate or something.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4789.261">To</a>  that effect, that it's a two-part process?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4793.367">Yeah,</a>  because I think, um, as I remember from last year, the final signature comes from, it comes back to us from Planned Development Sustainability and that the mayor signed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4803.432">So</a>  I believe that I need to see that too before we issue the license.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4810.535">I'm</a>  sorry, go ahead, Dana.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4813.497">No,</a>  no, no, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4814.878">I</a>  was just going to say I can work with Planned Development Sustainability so they can let me know whenever <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4822.656">or</a>  let's say AltaCoopa is approved, then I can automatically say, look, okay, once you fill this form out, you will be approved because you'll work by the commission.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4833.505">I</a>  just want to get the motion and get our interpretation of the process on record before any requests come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4843.014">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4843.874">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4847.277">So</a>  we're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4848.879">We</a>  second that we approved it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4850.732">Yeah,</a>  all in favor of accepting the motion, say aye.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4854.614">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4855.674">Good,</a>  good, good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4857.355">Thank</a>  you, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4857.975">Thank</a>  you, Bobby, for putting that in writing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4862.457">Now,</a>  Daria, is there anything more or are we caught up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4866.759">We're</a>  caught up, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4869.617">OK,</a>  we we all know about the new alcohol, outdoor dining, alcohol to go, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4875.602">We're</a>  all good with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4876.903">And</a>  basically it's it's right in the email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4880.986">So,</a>  you know, there's nothing new on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4884.589">And</a>  there was a question brought up on liquor, liqueur and cordial licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4890.875">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4892.335">Basically,</a>  you know, I did a little digging into that too, as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4897.138">And</a>  it's basically if it's an existing beer and wine that wants to get a liqueur and cordial as well, they have to do a change of category on the licensing authority certification form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4912.868">And</a>  the only thing I'm not sure of is where they're only required with malt and wine to have <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4922.344">19</a>  seating capacity, I would assume that rule carries even with liqueur and cordials, because it's not a distilled spirit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4932.529">I</a>  mean, I even looked up the definition of a distilled spirit, and liqueur or cordial is basically something that's blended with a distilled spirit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4943.694">So</a>  they can't sell vodka or gin or rum or bourbon, but they can sell <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4949.464">you</a>  know, like B&B or Galliano or whatever, other cordial, Cointreau or Grand Marnier, whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4957.988">I,</a>  you know, so I, myself personally, if someone should bring this forward to us and they've already got the beer and wine, yeah, it's 19 seating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4969.394">If</a>  it's a brand new license that wants beer, wine and cordials, yeah, it's 19 seating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4975.657">That's</a>  the way I feel about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4978.489">I</a>  don't know how you guys feel about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4981.372">You</a>  know, beer and wine, they only needed 19 for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4984.536">So</a>  if you want beer, wine, and cordial, which is another category, it should still apply, in my opinion, to the 19 seating.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4996.835">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=4998.935">You</a>  know, this sounds vaguely familiar that we discussed this a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5005.196">And</a>  I think it came out that your opinion, Bobby, I think was the same one as our prior chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5013.938">As</a>  long as they had malt and wine and whatever the minimum seating was at that time, he was okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5021.519">And</a>  I think where the precedent's already been there, I think we should stick with it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5026.762">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I think, I agree, I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5030.065">But</a>  somebody that has an existing license, they have to do a change of category.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5035.669">Change</a>  of category, sure.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5037.11">Yeah,</a>  if not, just apply for a new bearing line with cordials.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5041.013">With</a>  cordials, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5042.154">Other</a>  than that, I think that's the only other thing I had.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5046.677">Yeah,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5049.419">How</a>  do you feel on it, Ben? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5051.381">Yeah,</a>  I was just thinking,</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5057.063">The</a>  definite, the, sorry, what are the cordial definition is technically? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5061.947">Oh</a>  yeah, let me show you what it is.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5064.309">I</a>  got it here, I wrote it down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5066.491">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5068.693">Like</a>  it's just a type of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5070.994">Yeah,</a>  it's in chapter 138, section one definition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5075.558">Like</a>  a fruity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5078.0">It's</a>  a liquor or cordial. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5081.129">All</a>  alcoholic beverages manufactured or produced by mixing or redistilling neutral spirits, brandy, gin, or other distilled spirits with or over fruits, flowers, plants, cured juices, therefrom or other natural flavoring materials or with extracts derived from infusions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5103.76">percolations</a>  or maceration of such materials and containing no less than two and one half percent of sugar by weight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5112.167">Yeah,</a>  that's a liquor.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5113.488">So</a>  our opinion was it's like wine, sort of like a wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5118.792">No,</a>  it's like a sweet, yeah, weed alcoholic beverage.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5123.136">It's</a>  higher in proof than a wine.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5126.908">Not</a>  like a hard, whiskey, a bourbon, a rye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5132.591">Yeah,</a>  that's what I started keeping in mind or whatever with one of the craft beer, a craft beer that has a higher alcohol content. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5140.534">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5141.355">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5142.115">But</a>  you can't sell a distilled spirit, which is just a gin or a vodka or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5147.478">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5147.718">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5149.078">It's</a>  got to be something like, I imagine that, well, I've attempted to make lemon cello myself, and it's basically alcohol with sugar and lemon rind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5160.083">You</a>  don't use the actual lemon juice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5163.645">But</a>  those are exactly what I read. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5166.246">You</a>  know, there's the sugar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5168.387">It's</a>  got an abundant amount of sugar in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5171.714">And</a>  it's got the flavoring of the rind of the lemon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5174.955">So,</a>  you know, it falls into the category of liqueur and cordial because it's mixed with either vodka or straight alcohol and water, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5188.02">So,</a>  I mean, that's kind of where it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5190.461">It's</a>  a fine line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5192.441">There's</a>  some cordials out there that are, you know, 80 proof. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5197.303">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5197.583">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5200.162">All</a>  right, it was just a definition thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5202.604">No,</a>  I mean, I'm in agreement with what you both say about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5207.908">I</a>  really am in agreement with that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5211.51">And</a>  being kind of a guy looking for something to do every once in a while, I did a little revision, a very slight revision on the one day license application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5223.098">It</a>  just made it a little more user friendly and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5227.945">I</a>  had a chat with Gary about the fees, because it seems like there's no set way of paying for these licenses, and there's no way of really keeping track of who paid, who didn't pay, or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5242.069">So</a>  part of the application is, you know, in Method License Commission, one-day liquor license requirements, one through eight, you know, it says we can, or one through seven, we can add in the number eight, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5256.896">It</a>  says fee, dollar sign, payables, the city of Medford, pay due on day of application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5263.822">So</a>  they apply for the license, attach a check for $60. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5268.666">We</a>  don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5270.708">And</a>  then it says, number nine, the next one, licensee must notify license commission if event is canceled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5280.055">Because</a>  I guess a couple of times events have been canceled and you don't get your money back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5286.283">I</a>  don't think, but you should have a credit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5289.864">You</a>  know, Allen has seven or eight one day licenses a year and the other rain, they couldn't have it, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5296.745">They</a>  had to cancel it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5297.766">Okay,</a>  well, we'll just credit you a $60 payment or whatever, you know, just trying to keep track of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5303.627">And</a>  at the very top, the date of event, the license, I just put right below it, rain date, if any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5310.209">So</a>  that way there, you're giving the person the opportunity to have a legitimate rain date <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5316.13">And</a>  this license is still good for that date if the original date wasn't used.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5322.631">Can</a>  we kind of table that and let's talk about that at the end of the June meeting and buy it, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5330.658">I</a>  like tweaks, why not put it right there in writing so everyone sees what's expected or what they can expect.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5338.464">Yeah,</a>  and I can email it to you guys so they can look it over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5342.107">I'll</a>  email you guys and pull it apart, pick it apart, see what you think is good, not good, whatever.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5347.512">I</a>  mean, it seems reasonable.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5349.736">Yeah,</a>  I mean, it's just, you know, anything we can do to lighten the load for Daria would be good too, you know, because she's got enough to do that she doesn't have to go chasing people for money.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5360.682">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5363.563">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5365.144">All</a>  right, so if we're, Daria, we're all set, then I'll make a motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5371.347">It's</a>  2.31, according to my time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5375.429">Can</a>  we get a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5378.7">A</a>  second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5379.581">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5380.082">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5380.442">Bobby.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5380.923">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5381.323">Well,</a>  good to see everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5382.625">I</a>  thank you all for your help and your participation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5386.73">And</a>  like I said, we'll we'll revisit what you are referring to Bobby at the June meeting and then we're we're off July and August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-05-15-24&start=5395.4">Good.</a> </p>
