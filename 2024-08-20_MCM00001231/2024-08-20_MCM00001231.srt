1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:08,717
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'd like to jump into the meeting and get going, because it looks like it's a full load.

2
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:10,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at them.

3
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I counted them up.

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,739
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 32 cases.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,746
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 29 one-day requests and three, you know, one change of manager, change of officer.

6
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:26,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should get cracking.

7
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:29,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's jump into it.

8
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:35,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see, Gary, you put two hours for a Zoom allotment.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody's not on, they can always catch up as we move along.

10
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that all right, Bobby?

11
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:42,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben, you ready?

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:43,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready.

13
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:44,273
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, good.

14
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:51,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as always, we need to do some housekeeping items first.

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:56,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take a look at the minutes from the last meeting, just kind of review them.

16
00:00:57,341 --> 00:01:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd need a motion to accept the minutes into the record, the legal record.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to go over them.

18
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,573
[SPEAKER_03]: They all look good to me.

19
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's no issues there.

20
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:18,836
[SPEAKER_03]: How about yourself, Ben?

21
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:23,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was able to review them as well, and they look good.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would make a motion to approve them, if that's all right, if that's agreeable to you, Bob.

23
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

24
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, agree.

25
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:33,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I reviewed them.

26
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,429
[SPEAKER_04]: They're spot on.

27
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice, Daria.

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work.

29
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Bobby, are you going to second the motion?

30
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I'll second the motion.

31
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:44,457
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very good.

32
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:48,648
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of accepting the minutes, say aye.

33
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:49,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

34
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:49,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

35
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:50,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

36
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

37
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:53,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got that out of the way.

38
00:01:55,529 --> 00:02:00,391
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was saying, for everybody that's attending, there is a full load.

39
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:06,034
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was saying, there are 32 cases, 29 are one-day licenses.

40
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,716
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'd like to do is I'd like to bat out of order.

41
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this occasionally.

42
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:13,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's chairman's prerogative.

43
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:21,042
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to take care of the 1359 associates, Simmeliner and Wegmans first.

44
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can tackle the 29 one-day requests.

45
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:30,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben, Bobby, you think that's wise to get those out of the way first?

46
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:32,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

47
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's fine with me.

48
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,185
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.

49
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:36,725
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

50
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:42,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's jump into the 1359 associates first.

51
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:49,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do we have on the Zoom representing 1359 associates?

52
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,265
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Chris Watson.

53
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:55,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the president of the 1359 Associates.

54
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chris.

55
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:58,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

56
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, do you mind?

57
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I'm here as well as the manager that will be taking place.

59
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:13,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and so I see the amendment for the change of manager application.

60
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see we, you know, we, with all these forms and documents, we always check for completeness.

61
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,254
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3 commissioners were not.

62
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:30,217
[SPEAKER_04]: so we don't, you know, if we see something in there that gets by us, but we're really looking for completeness.

63
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:38,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, if you don't mind, if you could tell us a little about the change of manager, I believe it's John Malcolm.

64
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you give us a little background or history on Mr. Malcolm?

65
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:50,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I've been a bartender off and on for the 30, 40 years now.

66
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I worked in a bunch of different establishments throughout Somerville and Boston.

67
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:59,157
[SPEAKER_16]: I was a member of the 1359 for many years, stepped away to raise my children.

68
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:03,658
[SPEAKER_16]: I came back as a member and a worker a little over a year ago.

69
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:08,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And at that point, John Frazier, the bar manager, was ready to step down.

70
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,200
[SPEAKER_16]: He's getting on in years, and it was a lot for him.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So Chris had asked me if I'd like to step in and take the position, and I happily agreed to do so.

72
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, very good.

73
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:25,041
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm kind of scrolling through, I see the Cory check, I see your record of birth.

74
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any questions.

75
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, Ben, anything of concern for this change of manager request?

76
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,010
[SPEAKER_09]: My experience,

77
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about it.

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,101
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, go ahead, Ben.

79
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:52,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I just said, bartending experience?

80
00:04:54,608 --> 00:05:05,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I started bartending back in 1987 at a bar in Somerville and I stayed basically in Somerville for most of my bartending career and I spent a little bit of time at Faneuil Hall.

81
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:12,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's really that's really I've been away from the business for a good 6 or 8 years as far as working.

82
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:16,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I've been with 3059 for a little over a year now.

83
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:17,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

84
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:18,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

85
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:20,016
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

86
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:20,736
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's good.

87
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:21,297
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

88
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack.

89
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Verizon.

90
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

91
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,281
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm reading this correctly.

93
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:27,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

94
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:30,204
[SPEAKER_16]: I retired from Verizon about 3 years ago.

95
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

96
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:31,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

97
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, anything on your mind, any questions, concerns?

98
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:44,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked, I see the application, I see the Corey check, I see the entity.

99
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything come to mind that we've kind of missed or overlooked?

100
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: No, everything looks good to me, Mr. Chairman.

101
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an issue with this.

102
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:54,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

103
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I thought the same thing.

104
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,461
[SPEAKER_04]: The necessary paperwork are there.

105
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:13,306
[SPEAKER_04]: If one of two of you want to make a motion to accept and move forward the change of manager for 1359 Associates, I'm all ears.

106
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I can accept and make a motion for the change of manager at the 1359 Associates at 42 Alfred Street in Medford.

107
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:32,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Bobby.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ben.

[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

119
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,317
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all set.

120
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack, Chris, thank you very much.

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to make it as painless as possible.

122
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been awesome.

123
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:15,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

124
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:17,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

125
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:18,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

126
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Take your time, people.

127
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:20,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

128
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:21,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

129
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I close out?

130
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:29,763
[SPEAKER_16]: How do I close out?

131
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:33,205
[SPEAKER_16]: If you tap your screen, there should be a leave button up top.

132
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

133
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:35,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

134
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:35,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

135
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:40,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

136
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,911
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

137
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's tackle Semolina.

138
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.

139
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:52,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm attorney Mara Sheehan working with Semolina Kitchen, CJ Inc.

140
00:07:52,816 --> 00:08:02,519
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're here because there was a hearing February 21st and the ABCC came back with an RNA letter.

141
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,240
[SPEAKER_14]: So it had a couple of items that we have corrected.

142
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:12,622
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first one was there is no more pledge of stock in the transaction.

143
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,563
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a pure promissory note.

144
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:17,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly what they wanted.

145
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:25,467
[SPEAKER_14]: The name of the new stockholder director was corrected.

146
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:28,047
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Bruno de Oliveira Barbosa.

147
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,048
[SPEAKER_14]: A few places it was off there.

148
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:38,291
[SPEAKER_14]: We have corrected the formatting as well as the query request, the entity vote.

149
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:47,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the last item, working with Rose Egan at ABCC, there was an option to add a director.

150
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:55,568
[SPEAKER_14]: So Bruno de Oliveira is also petitioning to add as a director and shareholder.

151
00:08:55,608 --> 00:09:02,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the packet is complete and I would request that you recommend this favorably to the ABCC.

152
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, attorney, I thank you.

153
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:12,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You checked off all the boxes there, and you have C, exhibits 2A, 2C.

154
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you.

155
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You made it very simple to follow all the way through.

156
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Just about the change in director, Bobby Bend, is that something that can be piggybacked off the top of this, or do you think they have to come back for a change of director?

157
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:58,109
[SPEAKER_14]: May I add that I submitted a revised application and ABCC indicated that this was acceptable because he had been part of the petition for transfer of stock February 21st and so they felt comfortable with that.

158
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

159
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

160
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:02,011
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

161
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do the both at once, right?

162
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:08,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I think I think that's okay.

163
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the change of director.

164
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:12,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We could make it just conditioned upon maybe sees.

165
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:13,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

166
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when they when they review the final package.

167
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:16,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

168
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:17,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

169
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:18,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

170
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And can we just clarify that?

171
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a change of director on top of the sale.

172
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:34,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the issuance of stock, a transfer of stock, purchase of stock, and all of the stock documents are included within the packet.

173
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:39,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was previously approved by you, not ABCC yet.

174
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we just, there is some formatting questions.

175
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,074
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it looks.

176
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:48,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

177
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks good to me now.

178
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:50,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

179
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:53,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, then.

180
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

181
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't see any.

182
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:59,679
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take a vote.

183
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just kind of look through.

184
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we do, Mr. Chairman, I just had a question on the change of director.

185
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:14,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't appear to be on the original one.

186
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get an edited copy with the change of director checked off on that box with us?

187
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you did.

188
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:27,702
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

189
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You sent an edited one to Daria?

190
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:30,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

191
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:31,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

192
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

193
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I didn't, for some reason, I didn't see it in here.

194
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:43,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing through the three versions of it.

195
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It was revised three times, so I'm wondering if- Okay.

196
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Director, exhibit seven.

197
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:48,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

198
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:48,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

199
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:49,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

200
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:50,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

201
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:51,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

202
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

203
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, Ben, you wanna make a motion?

204
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, do you wanna do this one?

205
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can do it.

206
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:23,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to accept the changes in the edits of the previous change of manager and change of, I believe it was interest, stock interest, transfer of stock

207
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:32,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the Semolina license, trying to get a location.

208
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:42,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have everything in front of me.

209
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,801
[SPEAKER_03]: 572 Boston Ave, Medford.

210
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for the issuance slash transfer stock, new stockholder, and change of director.

211
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:55,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

212
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else looks fine to me.

213
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:11,733
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the stuff that the ABCC investigator was requesting, I spent a lot of time going over it, going into all the stuff that she was looking for.

214
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:16,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to find everything and everything had been done by the attorney, so I don't have a problem with this at all.

215
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, very good.

216
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:20,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Good work, Councilor.

217
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I'll second that motion.

218
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: by Commissioner Delfano.

219
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:27,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

220
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:35,161
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of moving the Semolina request forward to ABCC, say aye.

221
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:36,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

222
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:37,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

223
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Council, you're all set.

224
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:40,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

225
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:44,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for addressing those items on the RNA.

226
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it and best of luck.

227
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:49,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

228
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

229
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:51,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Mark.

230
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's jump into the third one, Wegmans.

231
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:02,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do we have?

232
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Attorney Devlin, are you there?

233
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's representing Wegmans?

234
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:10,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Good afternoon, Chairman Elizabeth Pisano from Upton, Connell, and Devlin.

235
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm calling in for Attorney Devlin this afternoon.

236
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

237
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:14,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

238
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:20,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us an overview?

239
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that Danny Wegman and Colleen Wegman, I see they're moving around.

240
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:32,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I see there's a strong core now.

241
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:34,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Wegman's there.

242
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But give us an overview of what's transpiring, please, if you don't mind, Councilor.

243
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:40,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

244
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:44,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So Wegman's is just changing their officers at the corporate level.

245
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:53,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Steven Arsiel is retired and he's being removed and replaced by Aaron Hines as a secretary.

246
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:57,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Matthew Daylor is going to be added as a director.

247
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:06,183
[SPEAKER_13]: And Nicole Wegman has also been added as a senior VP and director of the parent company.

248
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:13,266
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are a couple of changes in the corporate structure, but there are no changes to the

249
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:18,191
[SPEAKER_13]: to the restaurant space or the package store area.

250
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is going to remain exactly the same, operations exactly the same.

251
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,536
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a corporate change.

252
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that Councilor.

253
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:36,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Also just one thing to know, we realized that we were missing one page of the ABCC application.

254
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:44,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Matthew Daler was inadvertently left off of section six of the proposed officer.

255
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:52,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you don't mind, I'm just going to send you an amended page that you can just remove and replace before you send it to the ABCC.

256
00:15:53,927 --> 00:16:05,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, not only that, but, you know, I noticed that the Corey applications and then we're supposed to provide proof of citizenship.

257
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I think we were missing some.

258
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we were missing, like if we match up the proof of citizenship with the Corey records, they don't match up.

259
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're, we might be two or three short.

260
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're referring to, Councilor?

261
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:28,370
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the ABCC only requires a majority.

262
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,916
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't need to show everyone's proof of US citizenship, just only the amount that shows the majority.

263
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:41,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the proof of citizenship doesn't have to match up with the CORI applications?

264
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:42,889
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

265
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

266
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,170
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

267
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:45,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

268
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:46,952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

269
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:50,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the only thing that jumped out at me when I reviewed the package.

270
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:59,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wasn't sure whether those two... Again, we're not lawyers, but our job is to make sure the package is complete.

271
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:03,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it gets to ABCC, they don't go, what are they, morons down there?

272
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:10,329
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but that's why I'm going to send you an amended page just for you to replace.

273
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,851
[SPEAKER_13]: We made one mistake and need to just add somebody in there.

274
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:14,931
[SPEAKER_13]: He's in the description.

275
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,932
[SPEAKER_13]: You have his query of all of his information.

276
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:20,274
[SPEAKER_13]: His name was just left off of page two.

277
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

278
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:21,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

279
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:21,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

280
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're way ahead of us.

281
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:23,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

282
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:25,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have any questions.

283
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, Ben, anything come to mind?

284
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a simple question.

285
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,160
[SPEAKER_09]: There's these two packages.

286
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:35,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

287
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And what is the difference on it?

288
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to make sure.

289
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:45,251
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of them is for, there's two separate licenses.

290
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:50,236
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them is for the on-premise license and the other one is for the on-premise package store license.

291
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,537
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're just two different ones.

292
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:51,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

293
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,178
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to change both.

294
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:54,319
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're right.

295
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:54,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

296
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why there's these two.

297
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,343
[SPEAKER_09]: They look so similar.

298
00:17:59,443 --> 00:17:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

299
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:00,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

300
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:01,125
[SPEAKER_13]: They look the exact same.

301
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:01,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

302
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:02,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

303
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:03,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

304
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:19,435
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that I saw with these were the certificate of compliance for the Department of Unemployment Assistance.

305
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both expired and they're only good for like 30 days when you get these.

306
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:34,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can possibly just grab an updated one for both the licenses,

307
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:40,598
[SPEAKER_03]: that's required, I'm just looking at one of them here, one of the licenses, but if you can.

308
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem okaying this with the expired DUA thing.

309
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that once you get it, just send a copy so we can update our records.

310
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, definitely.

311
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:57,870
[SPEAKER_13]: The ABCC typically takes them up to 90 days, even though the expiration date isn't 30, they usually accept it within 90 days.

312
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:04,996
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have requested this from our client just in case ABCC doesn't get to it, you know, before June to review.

313
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,959
[SPEAKER_13]: So as soon as we get updated ones, we're happy to send it to your board.

314
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

315
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:14,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

316
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, Ben, you want to make a motion to move this forward?

317
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:21,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can.

318
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I can make a motion.

319
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:28,356
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

320
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:29,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

321
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:30,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

322
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:30,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

323
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:31,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

324
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:51,708
[SPEAKER_09]: After reviewing both of those applications, um, I'll make a motion to approve the application for the change of officer or the package store and the second application for the change of officer for the restaurant at Wegmans.

325
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:54,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

326
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Wigman's, Massachusetts.

327
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,375
[SPEAKER_07]: 3850 Misty Valley Parkway.

328
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 3850 Misty Valley Parkway.

329
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And I second that motion.

330
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ben.

331
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:09,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Bobby.

332
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor, accept in the change of officers.

333
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:15,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion, say aye.

334
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

335
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:17,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

336
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:20,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Council, you're all set.

337
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:20,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

338
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:21,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

339
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:22,772
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

340
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:23,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

341
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

342
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:24,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

343
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:25,755
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

344
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

345
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:41,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're, if I added correctly, there are 29 one-day license requests.

346
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I see that many.

347
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I missed some of them.

348
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:53,522
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think Alan is counting like how many we got from Medford Brewing and how many we got from Winter Hill Brewing.

349
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:54,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

350
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I'm just counting.

351
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Insurance.

352
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:03,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Insurance.

353
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that too.

354
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, yes, yep.

355
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, seven and seven from what I can see.

356
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:09,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

357
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:09,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

358
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:10,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

359
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:15,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess let's jump to the one-day licenses.

360
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:21,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have... Mr. Bailey, are you on with us?

361
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:26,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here, Robert Holdredge, representing Winter Hill Brewing.

362
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:28,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

363
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't mind, just kind of give us an overview.

364
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very familiar with the entity and you guys run a nice shop.

365
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your tip certified bartenders.

366
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys run a great operation.

367
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of give us an overview of what's happening and what the requests are for, if you don't mind.

368
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there was seven dates he requested.

369
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:53,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to list them all?

370
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:58,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we can just kind of get them on to public record.

371
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not sure if you don't mind.

372
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:05,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So June 6, June 27, July 25, August 1, August 15, and October 3 and 17.

373
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:19,952
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

374
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:21,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

375
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, like 4 to 8 p.m.

376
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:28,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, generally we wrap up a little earlier than 8 p.m.

377
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: as business dictates, but, you know, we have two TIPS certified employees, wristbanding everyone, IDing everyone.

378
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:41,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is our third or fourth year doing this, so.

379
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

380
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:45,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me,

381
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:53,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was going through the insurance policy, and I don't know if I'm missing something.

382
00:22:53,528 --> 00:23:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like you had policy dates, but it looked like August 15th.

383
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: was missing from one of the master policies, or is there another policy I'm not aware of?

384
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:16,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I see all the dates, you know, the 26th, the 25th, July 20th, but I don't see something for August 15th.

385
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I just missing it?

386
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,286
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you was missing, Mr. Chairman.

387
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the same thing.

388
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:23,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

389
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll have to get my partner on that.

390
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,411
[SPEAKER_05]: He kind of handles all the insurance stuff, but I'll make note of that.

391
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an easy fix.

392
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:39,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, we're very familiar with the operation where we see that the event's going to be down at the condom shell.

393
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:55,721
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess we could make this, I'm just kind of thinking out loud, if we could just approve this with the condition that the insurance gets, the event on August 15th get added to the insurance coverage.

394
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:58,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah, we'll get right on it.

395
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

396
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, Bobby, do you want to make a motion?

397
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:09,366
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one other issue that I can spot too, Mr. Commissioner.

398
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:15,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't notice it till just now when this gentleman reviewed the dates.

399
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:28,721
[SPEAKER_03]: The 6-27 date is on page two of his documentation with the layout of the condon shell along with the other dates.

400
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:33,267
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual application is for 6-25.

401
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering what the correct date is, 6-25 or 6-27.

402
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:39,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Our paperwork says 6-25.

403
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:45,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 6-25 is a Tuesday, so it has to be 6-27, right?

404
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,852
[SPEAKER_05]: The farmers market's on Thursdays.

405
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:50,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

406
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:50,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

407
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:56,614
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we can correct that and make it 6-27.

408
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the correct date.

409
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:09,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that yeah, so I think you just you update the policy, because it's also 625 on the policy, so you just update the policy with all the correct dates.

410
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:16,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay well with the additional date, and then you can correct that date.

411
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the 27th has got to be in there, and then August 15th has got to be in there.

412
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll have them fix that today.

413
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:33,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gary, you can, if you wouldn't mind, you just update our copy of the one day license, just change it to the 27.

414
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:35,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know for our records.

415
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:36,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we'll do.

416
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:38,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

417
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,219
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, great job by you guys.

418
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: The pictures, the layout, everything's perfect.

419
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

420
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having us again.

421
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:58,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's make a motion to move forward with the, what is it, seven?

422
00:25:58,676 --> 00:25:59,856
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three, seven of them?

423
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

424
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:02,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

425
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:05,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it is correct is on that packet, you guys.

426
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:06,899
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice packet you gave us.

427
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,860
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually, all the dates are right there, I think.

428
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

429
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I was looking at.

430
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't catch that they were off on the other one.

431
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:18,443
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're right.

432
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

433
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:20,604
2725.

434
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:22,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

435
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:22,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

436
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:29,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I can make a motion or Bob.

437
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:31,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion if you like.

438
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:44,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to approve the seven one day licenses with a contingent upon a correction from a

439
00:26:46,390 --> 00:27:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: with the new insurance coverage page, inserting the date for August 15th, 2024, which is missing, and also correcting the date on the insurance coverage page from June 25th to June 27th, 2024.

440
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:04,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dates we are approving are June 6th,

441
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:29,991
[SPEAKER_03]: June 27th, July 25th, August 1st, August 15th, October 3rd, October 17th for a beer garden at the Condon show for the Winter Hill Growing Company.

442
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

443
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:35,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

444
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:36,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the motion.

445
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:37,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the second, Ben.

446
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:42,798
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of moving forward with a one-day license request for Winter Hill, say aye.

447
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:44,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

448
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

449
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all set.

450
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:47,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

451
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:49,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

452
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:50,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

453
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:51,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

454
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

455
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

456
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it here at the Bear Garden.

457
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to do Medford Pride Day?

458
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:01,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll jump to that one.

459
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: That Medford Brewery.

460
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:07,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see here.

461
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,340
[SPEAKER_04]: How many are Medford Brewery?

462
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: There's seven.

463
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:15,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

464
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:18,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Next seven, OK.

465
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

466
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:24,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, before we do start, I actually have another quick question for you all.

467
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing a, we did it last year, where we're sponsoring the Dave McGill for a Run Medford run.

468
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're sponsoring their beer garden.

469
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:46,955
[SPEAKER_02]: and I haven't included it on one of the permit applications, because my memory is a bit fuddled.

470
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:52,058
[SPEAKER_02]: As it's not a paid thing, we're basically just donating this product through them.

471
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to get a one-day permit for that as well?

472
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:05,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be charging for the bid?

473
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:08,247
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all a giveaway.

474
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:18,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's open to the public and it's a paid admission.

475
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a paid admission to run the race?

476
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:21,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

477
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it on public property?

478
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:35,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, and I may be wrong because I move it around, I think they might be ending it at City Hall.

479
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:35,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

480
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:37,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

481
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:39,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And is this a non-profit as well?

482
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, those are the questions that might make a difference if it's an idea.

483
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:53,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but I believe they are nonprofit.

484
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:54,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

485
00:29:54,958 --> 00:30:00,481
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Dave said something to me last year stating that they're nonprofit.

486
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm happy to throw this stuff in and I can get you the CLI and stuff anyway, just for good measure, but I don't have it on me.

487
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a,

488
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:19,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess I'd like to err on the cautious side and say, yeah, you'll have to request one day just to cover ourselves.

489
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:25,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, Bobby, maybe this is something we can look into so we'll be ready for it next year when you pose the question again.

490
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, basically, other than insurance, there'd probably be no cost to Nick other than the product they're donating, obviously.

491
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:44,123
[SPEAKER_03]: and the money that you'd be putting out for insurance, everything else.

492
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no charge.

493
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,924
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not charging for the alcohol.

494
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:52,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really think there's an issue.

495
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:54,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We can issue a one-day license.

496
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,667
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no charge where it's a nonprofit.

497
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:59,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, why not get it?

498
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:00,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

499
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:02,910
[SPEAKER_03]: CYA, and we're good.

500
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because it's out in public.

501
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:07,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just in case.

502
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:08,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in case.

503
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:23,874
[SPEAKER_09]: My gut is that you would get it because whether you're donating or charging it, to us it's like if we're looking out for the liquor consumption around the city, I think it's the exact same kind of thing for us.

504
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:27,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We would just as well have it.

505
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:35,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can I make your second slightly dodgy request, which feel free to say no, stop it, Nick.

506
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I add that to my list and then send you all the paperwork tomorrow so I don't have to bother you again so soon with a few of my things?

507
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if that's not cool, there's no worries.

508
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just put them to another agenda.

509
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:54,908
[SPEAKER_02]: For just that one?

510
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not until September the 27th, 28th.

511
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:02,845
[SPEAKER_02]: We got plenty of time.

512
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we got plenty of time.

513
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:05,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

514
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:14,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we take, you know, traditionally or historically, we take the summer off, but we'll be back in September, definitely.

515
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can submit it September, whatever the third Wednesday is in September, up until then, you know?

516
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

517
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:25,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it wasn't just to lighten loads somewhere, but yeah, I can do that.

518
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, just kind of why we do have another meeting in June.

519
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

520
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

521
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

522
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: July and August.

523
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:35,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

524
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:36,693
[SPEAKER_18]: July and August will take off.

525
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:37,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

526
00:32:40,564 --> 00:33:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, just before I do, Carol, slightly entertaining for me was that, Bobbie, you weren't mentioned, but literally last week, Alan, I was chatting with Melinda, who was missing you from the bank, and Ben, Tom Dorsey was singing your praises to me the other day as well.

527
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:06,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a world of the small things.

528
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But no mention about you, Bobby.

529
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, mate.

530
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:14,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a good boy this week, I guess.

531
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:15,543
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all right.

532
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a small world.

533
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:20,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.

534
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a small city.

535
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, it is.

536
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:32,457
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I think that the tweets added in.

537
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:35,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're good now.

538
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions, concerns from anyone on this?

539
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have four for the show.

540
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:47,891
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, maybe we can look over the four or approve the four all at once.

541
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other three are different locations.

542
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might have to do them one at a time.

543
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:57,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the concert, correct?

544
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the dates for the concert?

545
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:01,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, the Farmers Market concert.

546
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So same place as usual, same thing.

547
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,641
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the signs.

548
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:15,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, and the same thing actually with, I think I put one in for the, it's the same sort of thing for the pizza festival.

549
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, did I include that one?

550
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Italian, yes, yes.

551
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we, yeah.

552
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:30,938
[SPEAKER_02]: which, as far as I know, that's also being put on pretty much by the Farmer's Market gang, so we'll go in the same spot for that as well.

553
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:35,561
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, is that the Italian Festival June 2nd you're referring to, Nick?

554
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's different.

555
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:38,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

556
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:40,764
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it might be different, actually.

557
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different, yeah.

558
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,265
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm mixing them up.

559
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:43,626
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

560
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:44,506
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

561
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:45,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

562
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't managed to corner that one yet.

563
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:53,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

564
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:55,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that one's different.

565
00:34:55,847 --> 00:35:00,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's coming up later today.

566
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:08,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we're going to add the concert ones.

567
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:09,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it, September 12th?

568
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, June 20th, July 18th, and September 12th.

569
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the three for the concert dates.

570
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

571
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:22,513
[SPEAKER_02]: September 12th, yes.

572
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a jazz festival too, right?

573
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:26,855
[SPEAKER_03]: 824, same location?

574
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:30,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, jazz festival, same location, which is on 824.

575
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:31,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

576
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can kind of throw those all on the same one, if you like, Mr. Chairman, that they're all on the same location.

577
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all the same location.

578
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:43,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the same vendor.

579
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:44,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

580
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

581
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:48,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm looking over it.

582
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:48,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks fine.

583
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you always do a good job, Nick.

584
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:54,838
[SPEAKER_03]: There's never any issues with your stuff.

585
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:59,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked you to get signs and cordon it off and you did all that.

586
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:03,483
[SPEAKER_03]: All your insurances is all up to date.

587
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got copies of everything for each event.

588
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So all looks good to me as well.

589
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

590
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So make a motion.

591
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

592
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:17,371
[SPEAKER_09]: The dates.

593
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:19,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll just do the common shell one first.

594
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that'll be easiest.

595
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:31,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll make a motion to approve the one day licenses for Medford Brewing Company.

596
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And the following dates, this is for the farmers market concerts.

597
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:45,674
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for June 20th, July 18th, September 12th.

598
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:47,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I missing a date?

599
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:49,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I guess 24th.

600
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for the Jazz Festival.

601
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:55,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

602
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And August 24th.

603
00:36:59,128 --> 00:36:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

604
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:00,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ben.

605
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that motion.

606
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:03,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

607
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:09,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So all in favor of approving the one day licenses for the concert series, say aye.

608
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:10,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

609
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

610
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, that's all set.

611
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to do the, did we do the seven, the other seven?

612
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we do that?

613
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting kind of confused here.

614
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got three more for Nick.

615
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We already did the seven for winter health.

616
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:27,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to, we have to do the other three.

617
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

618
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the community event that dug a park.

619
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:46,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like we got another community event that the members credit union in the square and another one for pride and method pride and city hall.

620
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,490
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

621
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:50,132
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

622
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:00,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good with you.

623
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:01,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the dates.

624
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the insurance.

625
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: We know the event.

626
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:05,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

627
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:06,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any questions on this.

628
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

629
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:13,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to do them separate with the different locations?

630
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang them on one at a time?

631
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:18,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Daria, that's all right with you.

632
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:19,715
[SPEAKER_04]: A little extra writing.

633
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:22,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, yeah.

634
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:23,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

635
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do, we'll take the three separately then.

636
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

637
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:32,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll, if you want, Ben, I'll lead off with the first one.

638
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

639
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:46,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one day license where you're going to, that the Method Growing Company is applying for, which is a community event at Duggar Park.

640
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's on the date of,

641
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:57,676
[SPEAKER_03]: June 22nd and June 23rd is a rain date.

642
00:38:58,396 --> 00:39:06,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we, if this is gonna be the same as last year, I believe we have a sketch on file for that.

643
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, the insurance we have.

644
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, I make a motion to grant this one day license.

645
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:19,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I got a picture as well on the folder.

646
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:23,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess you can email it all, but it'd be great.

647
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

648
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said to Daria, I'm not sure.

649
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent her so much stuff.

650
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed how she can keep up with it all.

651
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that right.

652
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

653
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

654
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:38,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: This is a different one.

00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,212
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Duggar Park community event.

660
00:39:53,833 --> 00:40:03,021
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor accepting the one day license for the event at Duggar Park, June 22nd with the rain date of June 23, say aye.

[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

664
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the confusion, everyone.

665
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

666
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:12,360
[SPEAKER_03]: We're overwhelmed today, I think.

667
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm all frazzled between the dog barking and everything else.

668
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:22,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So then the other one is the pride event.

669
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the last one?

670
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:26,329
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's two more.

671
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the next one would be the pride event, Ben.

672
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:32,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That's May 31st.

673
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:41,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I can make a motion to accept the one-day license for Medford Brewing for the pride event, which is from 4 to 7 p.m.

674
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,563
[SPEAKER_09]: on May 31st.

675
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll second the motion.

676
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:50,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the motion.

677
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:50,968

[SPEAKER_04]: That one's all set.

683
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last one.

684
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:18,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to grant the one day license for a community event to Medford Brewing Company on June 15th and rain date June 16th.

685
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:29,030
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is for community events at the 29 High Street, Members Plus Credit Union, Parapark.

00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, called Circle the Square, correct?

687
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:33,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

688
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't see it in here, the name of it, but yeah, I guess it's a community event.

689
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:39,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

690
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:40,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

691
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,718

[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

695
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:53,222
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of moving forward and accepting the one-day license for the June 15th community day, a.k.a.

[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

699
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:00,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All set.

700
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:03,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're okay with all of them now.

701
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:05,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

702
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll resend the West Medford Studios garden map thingy.

703
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same as last year, but I'll send it on to Dario as well later.

704
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:16,074
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

705
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

706
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

707
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nick.

708
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys.

709
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

710
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:22,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

711
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:30,678
[SPEAKER_04]: To the farmer's market, I think that we is house bear brewing in Stormalone cider.

712
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:31,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we

713
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,262
[SPEAKER_04]: we jumped away from when we were talking about the farmer's market.

714
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:39,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's address house beer brewing.

715
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:44,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do we have attending for house beer brewing?

716
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, it's me.

717
00:42:46,134 --> 00:42:48,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Karl Hirschfeld, one of the owners.

718
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:49,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

719
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:50,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

720
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:50,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.

721
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:56,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little about yourself.

722
00:42:56,665 --> 00:42:59,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little about House Beer Brewing LLC, please.

723
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:00,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

724
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:03,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing the Medford Farmers Market now since 2021.

725
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:06,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We make mead and cider.

726
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, the Medford Market's one of the better markets for us.

727
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:10,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say it's one of our top three.

728
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:12,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always enjoyable doing that.

729
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Venue down there is great at the Condon Shells.

730
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:18,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking forward to get back there again this year.

731
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:20,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

732
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:20,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

733
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:32,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we are all TIP certified and responsible servers, I'm kind of reading through the application.

734
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:39,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys do samples?

735
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do.

736
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:41,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

737
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it usually somebody, a woman who comes in, the other owner who represents?

738
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Beth, yeah.

739
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Beth usually sits in for these meetings.

740
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:49,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

741
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:55,314
[SPEAKER_09]: she's always been very informative.

742
00:43:55,814 --> 00:43:56,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

743
00:43:56,755 --> 00:43:57,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

744
00:43:57,296 --> 00:44:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I ask one question for the, for the chair, of course, you might guys, you, you folks sample as well as sell.

745
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:20,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we say sell, does that mean, um, for on premise consumption there at the market as well as

746
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:22,539
[SPEAKER_03]: to take product home?

747
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,020
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just for taking product home.

748
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:27,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for taking product home.

749
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:30,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a sample and then you buy a sealed container.

750
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:32,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

751
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:32,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

752
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I had thought, but I just wanted to double check.

753
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:36,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

754
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,049
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit difference in terms of how you go about things.

755
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:40,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

756
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:41,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

757
00:44:45,533 --> 00:44:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked over the application and I only found a minor

758
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,349
[SPEAKER_03]: A little minor glitch on page one.

759
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,511
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing before box number one is the year.

760
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:00,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It says 2023.

761
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should be 2024 for this season.

762
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:10,076
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys can, we can even correct that on our end just so we know.

763
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:13,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you guys can reprint the page.

764
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:14,538

00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see that.

779
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:58,325

[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it was, but I think that was the only one I found on this one.

[SPEAKER_04]: Shannon, are you with us?

00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:56,653
[SPEAKER_12]: So Shannon isn't here.

833
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:58,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Catherine Zonghetti.

834
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:02,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of the reps for Storm Along Cider and I'm the one that goes to the markets.

835
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:09,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little about what's going on, what you're doing.

836
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give us a good overview.

837
00:48:11,774 --> 00:48:12,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

838
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Shannon Edgar is the founder and owner.

839
00:48:14,774 --> 00:48:18,576
[SPEAKER_12]: He's very talented and makes wonderful hard cider.

840
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:23,017
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, we've been at the Medford Farmers Market for a few years now.

841
00:48:23,057 --> 00:48:24,077
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be our third.

842
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:26,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Carl was saying, we also love it.

843
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:33,020
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always a successful market and love the location and always

844
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:43,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonderful customers, so we are looking forward to, you know, sampling and selling at the farmers market again for the 2024 season.

845
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.

846
00:48:46,562 --> 00:48:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And same question, you know, they sample and if they like, they buy and then they go.

847
00:48:52,483 --> 00:48:52,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

848
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:54,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

849
00:48:56,364 --> 00:49:01,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I wonder if we should request that to be put in the, you know, in some of the narratives.

850
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:09,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a different, it would be a different license, right?

851
00:49:10,206 --> 00:49:10,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

852
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:11,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

853
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:12,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

854
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:15,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we give one day, because it would, this would turn into a beer fest.

855
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:20,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's like we give one days for, you know, the brewers.

856
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:24,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we give these guys different license to sell.

857
00:49:24,136 --> 00:49:24,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

858
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:25,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

859
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:29,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

860
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:31,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost an identical application.

861
00:49:31,778 --> 00:49:31,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

862
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:32,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

863
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:33,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

864
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually alternate with how spare brewing.

865
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be the opposite Thursdays.

866
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:40,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Same.

867
00:49:40,503 --> 00:49:42,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Same.

868
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:44,805
[SPEAKER_04]: 24, 24 rather than never mind.

869
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they had that one, right?

870
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any questions.

871
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: My fellow commissioners, anything?

872
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can make the motion if you like.

873
00:50:01,222 --> 00:50:04,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please.

874
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:25,575

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the second.

880

00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:48,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

882
00:50:48,986 --> 00:50:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

883
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Passes.

00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:17,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have everything covered.

895
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:19,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that Italian festival.

896
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:24,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, on June 2nd.

897
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,148
[SPEAKER_04]: By the board.

898
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:26,569
[SPEAKER_04]: June 6th.

899
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:29,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

900
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Seiji, are you with us?

901
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

902
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:38,251
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

903
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

904
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:40,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

905
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for waiting.

906
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:44,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming on.

907
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:45,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

908
00:51:45,872 --> 00:51:47,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little about the event.

909
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the same one that was held last year?

910
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:51,246
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is.

911
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:52,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

912
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so it's good overview of the event, please.

913
00:51:58,055 --> 00:52:00,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Danny, do you want to take that?

914
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:00,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

915
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:01,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

916
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:06,024
[SPEAKER_15]: So what the event is, is the Feast of the Republic.

917
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:06,365
[SPEAKER_15]: It's

918
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,562
[SPEAKER_15]: basically the 4th of July for Italy.

919
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:13,604
[SPEAKER_15]: It's when Italy became a republic after World War II.

920
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:21,971
[SPEAKER_15]: It is celebrated every year on June 2nd, or the weekend of June 2nd, whatever falls on a Sunday.

921
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:34,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Historically, the event was in Boston, and it was celebrated for many years in Waterfront Park, and a couple years ago,

922
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:44,683
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee had approached me and had asked me for my help, because I actually chair a much larger event, the Fisherman's Feast of Boston.

923
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:49,705
[SPEAKER_15]: And I told them I would help them, but they would have to move this event to my city.

924
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:59,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a resident of Medford, and we really didn't have any Italian festivals or anything promoting our Italian culture.

925
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:04,533
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I told them I would get involved and they jumped right in.

926
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,113
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the event last year.

927
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:13,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, it rained, but Medford Rec was nice enough to help us out and get us indoors.

928
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:18,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And the event was still very, very successful, even though it rained.

929
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:24,917
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're looking forward to being able to do it again this year, only doing it outside.

930
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:26,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

931
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:27,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dan.

932
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

933
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:39,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember it last year, I brought my son by there and it was fine.

934
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:43,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It was inside and it was where the Y is, right?

935
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:45,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

936
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,228
[SPEAKER_15]: We made the best of it.

937
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:52,634
[SPEAKER_15]: We still had some food vendors that roughed it out outside and it worked out well.

938
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:56,617
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people though, so outside will be great.

939
00:53:57,298 --> 00:53:57,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

940
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I see the 1 day license request diary.

941
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:03,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there something I'm missing?

942
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:06,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the insurance for it?

943
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:08,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do we have a little diagram or a layout of.

944
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:13,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Of where the events taking place didn't have any have those 2 items been submitted.

945
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:15,340
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the, the.

946
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:24,869
[SPEAKER_15]: The layout I submitted to diary a little earlier, uh, right before the meeting, actually, uh, it's the same layout that we used last year.

947
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:26,750
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to be right adjacent to the show.

948
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,171
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be a cordoned off area.

949
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:34,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, roped off clearly roped off area for the alcohol.

950
00:54:35,293 --> 00:54:38,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and it is not to leave that area obviously.

951
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:45,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and as far as the insurance rider, I'm waiting literally for an email right now.

952
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:45,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

953
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:57,368
[SPEAKER_15]: from my insurance, from our insurance company, with the coverage, which I also can get to Daria, which she can forward it to you, I'd say within the hour.

954
00:54:58,289 --> 00:54:58,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.

955
00:54:59,069 --> 00:54:59,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrific, Dan.

956
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:00,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

957
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:06,233
[SPEAKER_09]: This drawing is the back of the pizza box one from last year.

958
00:55:06,794 --> 00:55:07,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

959
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:09,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

960
00:55:10,736 --> 00:55:11,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty good, right?

961
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:13,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It was.

962
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:17,816
[SPEAKER_09]: You got the straight line in the box.

963
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,737
[SPEAKER_09]: You can follow.

964
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:20,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

965
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:31,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe next year when we can see a little better after this successful year, I can actually, you know what, I have to create one for, for the food vendors anyways.

966
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:38,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm actually, I'll, I'll get a Google earth one and get that out to you before the, you know, within a week or before the event.

967
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:39,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

968
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:40,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

969
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:46,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one question.

970
00:55:47,686 --> 00:55:52,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You folks realize that this is wine and malt only, not all alcohol, correct?

971
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:58,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because in order to have an all alcohol, you have to be a nonprofit.

972
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:01,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a nonprofit event.

973
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:04,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just going to be wine and malt.

974
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Sage, you're with the Ford.

975
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:14,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I am.

976
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:15,662
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

977
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:17,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you guys are doing this event.

978
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:21,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are providing the tip certified bartender and everything.

979
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:22,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, correct.

980
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:23,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I am tip certified.

981
00:56:23,368 --> 00:56:25,589
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be present doing all that good stuff.

982
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,112
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

983
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:34,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And are you guys setting up the section where the alcohol is going to be distributed?

984
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:39,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, correct.

985
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:41,326
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have it sectioned off.

986
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:44,668
[SPEAKER_19]: So and we'll have signs put up no alcohol outside these premises.

987
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,190
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll stay within that section.

988
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,311
[SPEAKER_19]: So no alcohol will leave that area.

989
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:49,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

990
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:58,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, really what it is, you still want people wandering off, you know, like with a drink in their hand, just so it stays contained.

991
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So okay.

992
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:04,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

993
00:57:04,884 --> 00:57:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we, we picked up the little nuances in there.

994
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, Bobby, Ben, anything else jump out at you?

995
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: No, everything looks great to me.

996
00:57:16,614 --> 00:57:16,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

997
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:24,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel, you're aware of the nonprofit versus the corporation rules, correct?

998
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, correct.

999
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure.

1000
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:27,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1001
00:57:28,084 --> 00:57:30,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we went through the same last year.

1002
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:35,330
[SPEAKER_15]: It's literally just, like you said, wine and malt.

1003
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:36,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

1004
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:41,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so Bobby and Ben, if you want to make a motion.

1005
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:44,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can do it.

1006
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:50,163
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I'll make a motion to accept the application for the one-day license.

1007
00:57:50,803 --> 00:57:55,827
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for the Italian festival, which is going to be on June 2nd from 11 AM to 2 PM.

1008
00:57:56,748 --> 00:58:00,411
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be held at the Condon Shell in Medford.

1009
00:58:01,112 --> 00:58:08,838
[SPEAKER_09]: The entity running it, Mystic Dining LLC, Ford Tavern, this is for the alcohol.

1010
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:26,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, following the depiction we see there, the plan we see there, and then subject to Dan getting us insurance.

1011
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:28,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1012
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I second it.

1013
00:58:30,397 --> 00:58:30,597
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1014
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1015
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:32,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the motion.

1016
00:58:32,578 --> 00:58:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the second.

1017
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor of accepting the one-day license for the Italian Festival June 2nd with the conditions

1018
00:58:42,053 --> 00:58:45,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Ben, lay down, say aye.

1019
00:58:46,014 --> 00:58:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1020
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1021
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:48,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1022
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,234
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, it's a go.

1023
00:58:50,395 --> 00:58:51,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, no rain.

1024
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:52,375
[SPEAKER_04]: No rain.

1025
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:53,435
[SPEAKER_15]: No rain.

1026
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:56,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Come down and have a glass of vino with us, will you?

1027
00:58:58,016 --> 00:58:58,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Will do.

1028
00:58:58,396 --> 00:58:59,316
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1029
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, guys.

1030
00:59:00,316 --> 00:59:00,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Take care.

1031
00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:01,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1032
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:02,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1033
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

1034
00:59:02,857 --> 00:59:03,737
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1035
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:04,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1036
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:08,078
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1037
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we got everybody?

1038
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we missed anything?

1039
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:14,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1040
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:17,673
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have one more from Alvaro for Alta Cuba.

1041
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:21,276
[SPEAKER_18]: I sent it, I think, 1220-ish.

1042
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:24,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, OK.

1043
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1044
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:33,026
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you guys got the email that I forwarded from the mayor,

1045
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:40,598
[SPEAKER_18]: stating pretty much KP law told us that it's up to the city how we want to approach a lot of dining with liquor.

1046
00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:48,332
[SPEAKER_18]: And the mayor is, of course, in support of outdoor dining room liquor.

1047
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:51,694
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's up to us on how we want to handle it.

1048
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:55,597
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I was trying to get you guys' input before.

1049
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:58,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And Alvaro has been asking me about it for some time.

1050
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:06,044
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to get him on to just get it done for him if we just want to continue to do with the way we've done it for the past couple of years.

1051
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:13,594
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, because we also have Oasis that has reached out.

1052
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:19,116
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did call Oasis, but I didn't hear back.

1053
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,656
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not in the office today.

1054
01:00:20,696 --> 01:00:22,056
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe he did call me back.

1055
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:22,837
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

1056
01:00:25,897 --> 01:00:30,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my only concern is as long as it's a dedicated area,

1057
01:00:33,221 --> 01:00:41,186
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's a dedicated space to serve, I think I would be fine with that.

1058
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:47,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy that the mayor is all for it to keep the city moving and the city being vibrant.

1059
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:52,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything, Bobby, Ben, anything jump out at you?

1060
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:58,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Any concerns or additions to making sure the serving area is sectioned off?

1061
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:06,558
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no drawing of it, right?

1062
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:12,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Alvaro?

1063
01:01:14,982 --> 01:01:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hear you.

1064
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:20,425
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on mute, Alvaro.

1065
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

1066
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:26,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1067
01:01:26,828 --> 01:01:31,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I sent the print how it will be set up.

1068
01:01:31,743 --> 01:01:36,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically what we use the same way as what we did in the notch previous years.

1069
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in two years in a row, we were able to get alcohol.

1070
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:46,430
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're asking also part of the drawing is to have some on the sidewalk because it's a wider sidewalk.

1071
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:51,193
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much all on the outdoor.

1072
01:01:51,213 --> 01:02:00,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there is anything that needs to be required to keep the people more enclosed.

1073
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:05,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, did you actually send it?

1074
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So no, I mean, I was thinking about it, because you have to knock and that's a notch.

1075
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's all good.

1076
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:14,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really, I'm just speaking for myself.

1077
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem with it.

1078
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, you're doing a great job at that restaurant.

1079
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:21,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very successful restaurant.

1080
01:02:21,562 --> 01:02:22,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have no problem with it.

1081
01:02:25,203 --> 01:02:31,804
[SPEAKER_09]: But assuming all the other boards in the city, OK, I'm sure you have to sort of submit some kind of plan to them.

1082
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that is correct.

1083
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:39,715
[SPEAKER_18]: So everybody still has to go through outdoor dining commission.

1084
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:48,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of it, so PDS is a part of it, building, fire, engineering.

1085
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,602
[SPEAKER_18]: So everybody does work together still.

1086
01:02:51,302 --> 01:02:54,546
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just we're waiting on the alcohol part.

1087
01:02:54,686 --> 01:03:01,773
[SPEAKER_18]: And as you guys know, they just approved it May, like the first week of May, the state.

1088
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:03,514
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't.

1089
01:03:05,056 --> 01:03:05,136
[SPEAKER_00]: We.

1090
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:09,349
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been approved, and I have the permit.

1091
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:17,254
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't get approved for people can drink outside, it makes no sense for us financially to actually do it.

1092
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:25,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're waiting in order to actually build and do what we want to do in front of the place.

1093
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,262
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, we're just going to be pending.

1094
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1095
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I get that.

1096
01:03:33,171 --> 01:03:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was going to say, I think of the great American Bear Hall where there was nothing there.

1097
01:03:40,256 --> 01:03:50,643
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing there, but we said, OK, as long as the conditions that the city puts down, I think we'd be fine.

1098
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:58,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, Navarre, you're saying that the city's already looked at your plans and they're fine with it.

1099
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:03,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of echo Ben's sentiment that I'm fine with the two.

1100
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything to keep the city vibrant as long as we're minimizing the risk to the owner and the city, I'm good with this.

1101
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:14,712
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Bobby?

1102
01:04:14,732 --> 01:04:23,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did some research on this and I really dug into those.

1103
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:39,177
[SPEAKER_03]: emails that Daria sent us about the new ABCC rules and the governor signing that this is going to be up to the local licensing authority.

1104
01:04:41,438 --> 01:04:44,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It made it an act making appropriations for fiscal year 2024.

1105
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it is is

1106
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:56,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically in a nutshell, it's the same exact thing as we've been doing since COVID in 2020.

1107
01:04:58,124 --> 01:05:06,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The city has got its own rules that the licensee has to abide by.

1108
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:14,869
[SPEAKER_03]: The only difference is the ABCC come up with a new form, which I'm trying to put my hands on.

1109
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:19,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a licensing authority certification form

1110
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: One pager, and any licensee in the city can fill this out.

1111
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:27,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no charge.

1112
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:34,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They've added an additional box to the top with all the boxes, change of office, ownership, interest, change of manager.

1113
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:38,057
[SPEAKER_03]: They put outdoor only alteration of premise.

1114
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:40,258
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to be checked.

1115
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:49,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to put the licensee's information in with a complete description of the license premise, inside and outside.

1116
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:56,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as they do that, we approve it.

1117
01:05:57,086 --> 01:06:06,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as they're abiding by the outdoor dining commission regulations, we're good.

1118
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:11,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They can have outdoor alcohol just like they've had the past three years.

1119
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the ABCC doesn't get involved in it.

1120
01:06:16,216 --> 01:06:18,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strictly turned over to us now.

1121
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:31,552
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing Daria has to do is once these forms are filled out, they have, she has to send it through the portal to the ABCC to inform them of who is doing alcohol outdoors.

1122
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to continue from this point forward every year.

1123
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:40,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, every year you'll just have to fill out this form.

1124
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:46,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the licensing authority certification form and

1125
01:06:48,356 --> 01:06:57,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That's giving our approval to allow you to sell alcohol outdoors as long as you're complying with the Outdoor Dining Commission rules.

1126
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:04,004
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably going to be an easy way to do it or a hard way to do it.

1127
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:10,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The hard way to do it would have you fill out these forms and bring it before us to approve each and every one of them.

1128
01:07:12,668 --> 01:07:16,830
[SPEAKER_03]: The easy way to do it, and I was going to suggest to my fellow commissioners,

1129
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:23,120
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we had just adopt the ABCC and governor's new ruling.

1130
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:43,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically all that does is we can make it citywide that when Daria receives one of these forms, she can grant the outdoor dining license as long as the licensee has complied with the outdoor dining commission rules.

1131
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:47,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So each one doesn't have to come to us.

1132
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:57,518
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just gonna approve it on a blanket type approval that anybody that fills out this form is good to go as long as they're complying with the Outdoor Dining Commission rules.

1133
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:00,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I think it'd be the easiest.

1134
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,343
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds much easier.

1135
01:08:03,543 --> 01:08:03,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1136
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:09,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like adopting a new law or whatever, you know, it's just, because obviously,

1137
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:18,522
[SPEAKER_03]: These, they can't, everybody can't get all their forms in and then have to wait until the end of our meeting in June.

1138
01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:20,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just gonna be too crazy.

1139
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:22,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be able to work.

1140
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:35,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just say, anybody that wants it or inquires about it, or wants to do alcohol outside, fill out the licensing authority certification form, and you got it, as long as you're compliant.

1141
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know how you guys feel about it.

1142
01:08:39,076 --> 01:08:42,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I think it's efficient.

1143
01:08:42,556 --> 01:08:43,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clean.

1144
01:08:43,157 --> 01:08:44,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1145
01:08:45,277 --> 01:08:45,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1146
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:47,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's smart.

1147
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Dario, does that work for you?

1148
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:54,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, would that also make it a little more streamlined for you as well?

1149
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's fine.

1150
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,281
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're talking about that form that I usually fill out, correct?

1151
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:02,061
[SPEAKER_18]: The local licensing decree?

1152
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:12,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the form that was attached to those documents from the ABCC regarding the outdoor dining and the cocktails to go.

1153
01:09:14,323 --> 01:09:21,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that they want you to return a copy to them once it's completed.

1154
01:09:22,308 --> 01:09:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, it has one, two, three boxes along besides all the

1155
01:09:30,248 --> 01:09:35,730
[SPEAKER_03]: things on the top that you change your license type, change it, transfer a license, whatever you want to do.

1156
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:40,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's got to be outdoor only alteration of premise has got to be checked off.

1157
01:09:41,032 --> 01:09:48,595
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant's information, it's just their licensee, DBA, street address, manager, type, class, and category.

1158
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:54,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they've got to put a complete description of the premise indoor and outdoor.

1159
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:55,498
[SPEAKER_03]: The box below it

1160
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:59,179
[SPEAKER_03]: It says local licensing authority information.

1161
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertised, yes or no.

1162
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to advertise.

1163
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:03,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a no.

1164
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:05,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Just check off the box, no.

1165
01:10:05,643 --> 01:10:06,924
[SPEAKER_03]: About as notified, no.

1166
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:11,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they already have their alcohol license.

1167
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:22,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And then date approved by the LLA, if all their paperwork is in order and they present this application to you, that's the date it's approved.

1168
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:24,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's, you know,

1169
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:31,760
[SPEAKER_03]: We're approving all of these as long as they're in compliance with the outdoor diving commission.

1170
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:32,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1171
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:35,181
[SPEAKER_00]: How long it would take that?

1172
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:37,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

1173
01:10:37,922 --> 01:10:41,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how long it will take this process?

1174
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:45,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I called the ABCC prior and then we couldn't get an answer from them.

1175
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:52,165
[SPEAKER_00]: The explanation they gave me is once they go into the authorities, it will be like basically the previous years.

1176
01:10:53,027 --> 01:11:07,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the previous year, I remember I never submitted any, once I have an approval of the inside of the space, now I have to do a description of the inside and outside, even though that I'm only doing alteration of the outside because I never had it.

1177
01:11:09,176 --> 01:11:15,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to see how, on the timeframe, how long it would take me to actually do this.

1178
01:11:16,624 --> 01:11:18,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me ask you a question.

1179
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:23,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you approved for the outdoor dining commission already?

1180
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:25,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have compliance?

1181
01:11:26,771 --> 01:11:26,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1182
01:11:27,131 --> 01:11:30,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I just say that I have a permit already in place.

1183
01:11:30,594 --> 01:11:32,915
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing is that we don't do the build out.

1184
01:11:33,076 --> 01:11:40,941
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because if we are not OK to sell alcohol, it makes no sense for us financially to do it.

1185
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:43,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only reason we haven't done it.

1186
01:11:43,543 --> 01:11:43,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1187
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:45,124
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's correct.

1188
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:57,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the commission approves, Mr. Chairman, he can come to city hall today and pick up his form, fill it out, and he's good to go tomorrow.

1189
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Three more.

1190
01:12:00,455 --> 01:12:02,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Avaro, get that form filled.

1191
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: My thought is, since you've already meet the criteria for the city, we're OK with that.

1192
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:12,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Just complete that form, get it back to us.

1193
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're good to go, unless I'm missing something.

1194
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:19,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, Ben, am I missing something?

1195
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:21,330
[SPEAKER_04]: He's already been approved by the city.

1196
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the city's OK with it.

1197
01:12:23,392 --> 01:12:24,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're good with it.

1198
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:34,821
[SPEAKER_18]: So just an FYI, the mayor just said it's up to the Liquor Commission on how we want to handle it, if we want to do a bonus notification or whatever.

1199
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:38,925
[SPEAKER_18]: So just passing it along, just a messenger.

1200
01:12:41,175 --> 01:12:46,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, if there's no need for a butters notification, why put the licensee for that?

1201
01:12:46,298 --> 01:12:48,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and that's that's what I think.

1202
01:12:48,139 --> 01:12:50,641
[SPEAKER_18]: So we did that before we do.

1203
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:52,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we have to do it when there's.

1204
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:57,731
[SPEAKER_18]: When there's an official alteration of premises, right, we do have to do it.

1205
01:12:57,811 --> 01:12:59,132
[SPEAKER_18]: When Medford Brewing had to do it.

1206
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:13,739
[SPEAKER_18]: But just my two cents in, you guys don't need my input, but just my chain of thought on this is that we're only doing this from April 1st to October 1st, I believe, is the season of outdoor dining.

1207
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:17,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not, you know, where you do it at all the time.

1208
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:35,124
[SPEAKER_18]: I just don't know if we should be doing this case by case because some places, Alvaro's place is not in residential, it's just business area, but some are more in residential area, so I don't know.

1209
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:35,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1210
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:41,948
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought on that, Daria, is it wasn't required for the past four years since COVID.

1211
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:46,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So according to the ABCC,

1212
01:13:47,043 --> 01:13:59,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the email from the governor's office, it's to follow the 2022 rule, I believe it says, that was put out from the governor.

1213
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:06,802
[SPEAKER_03]: On April 7, 2022, the ABCC approved guidelines for outdoor alcoholic beverage service areas.

1214
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we've been following.

1215
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:13,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't require a notification.

1216
01:14:13,423 --> 01:14:18,408
[SPEAKER_03]: You're 100% right if they're doing an alteration of premises, absolutely it needs it.

1217
01:14:19,108 --> 01:14:21,890
[SPEAKER_03]: But for this, no, it doesn't need it.

1218
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why in those boxes, advertise, no.

1219
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:26,935
[SPEAKER_03]: About a notify, no.

1220
01:14:29,317 --> 01:14:32,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we're good to go.

1221
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:35,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he can come today and pick up this form from you

1222
01:14:36,536 --> 01:14:39,077
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can email it to him, he can fill it out and bring it to you.

1223
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:42,658
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as he brings it to you, there's no charge, he's good to go.

1224
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:47,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can send it to Omar because I'm not, I'm out till Monday.

1225
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:48,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1226
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want, I can email him one, do you want to, well, that's right, you know, I mean.

1227
01:14:54,762 --> 01:14:57,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, email would be great.

1228
01:14:57,603 --> 01:15:04,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I can email it to you, fill it out and email it back to Daria and you're good.

1229
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he'll be all set.

1230
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if she's got to fill out a little something when she gets back from vacation, that's fine.

1231
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:12,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we can do it.

1232
01:15:12,622 --> 01:15:15,363
[SPEAKER_03]: That is as long as it's okay with my fellow commissioners.

1233
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:23,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to, like I said, it's clean, it's smart, it's efficient.

1234
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:28,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, Bobby, we're kind of following the rules from COVID 2020 going forward.

1235
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm good with that.

1236
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:35,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as long as he completes that form and gets it back to us so we have it for record.

1237
01:15:36,692 --> 01:15:38,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should be fine.

1238
01:15:38,954 --> 01:15:44,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know, you feel bad for these fellows too because they've already lost a month and a half.

1239
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:56,808
[SPEAKER_03]: This is usually April first, you know, and I don't know whether the governor dragged their feet on it or what happened, but you know, all these restaurants in the whole state lost a month, you know.

1240
01:15:57,409 --> 01:15:57,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.

1241
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let them do it.

1242
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:00,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1243
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1244
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so time is of the essence, Alvaro.

1245
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that form, get it back to us.

1246
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, best of luck.

1247
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:14,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Alvaro, do you want to give me your email address and I'll send it to you?

1248
01:16:14,972 --> 01:16:16,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sending it to him, Bobby.

1249
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:16,853
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing it.

1250
01:16:16,913 --> 01:16:17,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you are?

1251
01:16:17,693 --> 01:16:17,853
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1252
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:18,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.

1253
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:18,853
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1254
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:19,033
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1255
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:22,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you all.

1256
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:24,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1257
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:26,155
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome, Alvaro.

1258
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:26,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.

1259
01:16:27,996 --> 01:16:28,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1260
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Daria, anything else?

1261
01:16:32,615 --> 01:16:37,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have to put this in a form of a motion, the way we're handling it, or no?

1262
01:16:37,536 --> 01:16:45,817
[SPEAKER_18]: I think so, just to have it there in minutes and officially that you guys discussed this and this is the way you want to handle it.

1263
01:16:46,397 --> 01:16:48,018
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be a good idea.

1264
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1265
01:16:49,998 --> 01:16:53,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That way it's on record that we discussed it and we voted on it.

1266
01:16:53,619 --> 01:17:02,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bobby, if you don't mind making that, I know you explained it very well, if you mind giving us a little narrative again and we can vote on it.

1267
01:17:02,856 --> 01:17:04,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll make the motion.

1268
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:10,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make the motion from this point forward, May 15, 2024.

1269
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:27,172
[SPEAKER_03]: We are to follow the guidelines of the ABCC for outdoor only alteration of premise licenses on an annual basis.

1270
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: from, Daria, I think you said April 1st to October 31st.

1271
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:39,395
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe, yeah, I can check the dates with the outdoor dining people.

1272
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:41,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's fine.

1273
01:17:42,537 --> 01:17:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: For those dates, pending the licensee is in full compliance with the Outdoor Dining Commission,

1274
01:17:56,993 --> 01:18:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: and a licensing authority certification form has been completed and turned in to the local licensing authority.

1275
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,261
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be automatic approval if that is the case.

1276
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:14,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I didn't leave anything out.

1277
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:15,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got it.

1278
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we reference to CUBA here?

1279
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:20,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1280
01:18:20,966 --> 01:18:23,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we reference to CUBA specifically though?

1281
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for any licensee.

1282
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just in general.

1283
01:18:28,187 --> 01:18:29,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Any licensee.

1284
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:36,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Then if he submits that, then we can OK it then.

1285
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:40,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?

1286
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we receive this license application,

1287
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:46,748
[SPEAKER_03]: then he's good to go.

1288
01:18:47,488 --> 01:18:47,949
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1289
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:49,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what that's OK.

1290
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we're getting the motion and then we'll vote on the motion.

1291
01:18:53,532 --> 01:18:54,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's the record.

1292
01:18:55,113 --> 01:18:56,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he'll get the stuff to us later on.

1293
01:18:57,414 --> 01:19:01,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll second that motion that Bob said.

1294
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:14,345
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, one further thing, you think that we should put some language in there that upon proof of outdoor dining commission

1295
01:19:14,906 --> 01:19:18,667
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance, this license will be granted.

1296
01:19:20,128 --> 01:19:24,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Because anybody can come to us and say, yeah, remote that they said I could do it now.

1297
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll just give you this farm and I'll start selling the liquor.

1298
01:19:27,631 --> 01:19:31,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't know if he's been officially approved because

1299
01:19:32,323 --> 01:19:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to see some paperwork from somebody.

1300
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two-part verification.

1301
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:45,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the form, and then we need the outdoor dining commission to approve this.

1302
01:19:45,497 --> 01:19:45,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1303
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They must have some kind of certificate or something.

1304
01:19:49,261 --> 01:19:52,444
[SPEAKER_04]: To that effect, that it's a two-part process?

1305
01:19:53,367 --> 01:20:03,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, because I think, um, as I remember from last year, the final signature comes from, it comes back to us from Planned Development Sustainability and that the mayor signed.

1306
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:09,475
[SPEAKER_18]: So I believe that I need to see that too before we issue the license.

1307
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:13,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, go ahead, Dana.

1308
01:20:13,497 --> 01:20:14,858
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, I'm sorry.

1309
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:21,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just going to say I can work with Planned Development Sustainability so they can let me know whenever

1310
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:31,604
[SPEAKER_18]: or let's say AltaCoopa is approved, then I can automatically say, look, okay, once you fill this form out, you will be approved because you'll work by the commission.

1311
01:20:33,505 --> 01:20:42,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get the motion and get our interpretation of the process on record before any requests come in.

1312
01:20:43,014 --> 01:20:43,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1313
01:20:43,874 --> 01:20:47,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

1314
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all set.

1315
01:20:48,879 --> 01:20:50,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We second that we approved it.

1316
01:20:50,732 --> 01:20:53,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all in favor of accepting the motion, say aye.

1317
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:54,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1318
01:20:55,674 --> 01:20:56,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good, good.

1319
01:20:57,355 --> 01:20:57,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ben.

1320
01:20:57,975 --> 01:21:02,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Bobby, for putting that in writing.

1321
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Daria, is there anything more or are we caught up?

1322
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We're caught up, I believe.

1323
01:21:09,617 --> 01:21:15,382
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we we all know about the new alcohol, outdoor dining, alcohol to go, right?

1324
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all good with that.

1325
01:21:16,903 --> 01:21:20,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it's it's right in the email.

1326
01:21:20,986 --> 01:21:24,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's nothing new on that.

1327
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:30,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a question brought up on liquor, liqueur and cordial licenses.

1328
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:31,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1329
01:21:32,335 --> 01:21:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you know, I did a little digging into that too, as well.

1330
01:21:37,138 --> 01:21:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically if it's an existing beer and wine that wants to get a liqueur and cordial as well, they have to do a change of category on the licensing authority certification form.

1331
01:21:52,868 --> 01:22:01,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing I'm not sure of is where they're only required with malt and wine to have

1332
01:22:02,344 --> 01:22:12,349
[SPEAKER_03]: 19 seating capacity, I would assume that rule carries even with liqueur and cordials, because it's not a distilled spirit.

1333
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I even looked up the definition of a distilled spirit, and liqueur or cordial is basically something that's blended with a distilled spirit.

1334
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:28,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can't sell vodka or gin or rum or bourbon, but they can sell

1335
01:22:29,464 --> 01:22:37,048
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like B&B or Galliano or whatever, other cordial, Cointreau or Grand Marnier, whatever.

1336
01:22:37,988 --> 01:22:48,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, so I, myself personally, if someone should bring this forward to us and they've already got the beer and wine, yeah, it's 19 seating.

1337
01:22:49,394 --> 01:22:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a brand new license that wants beer, wine and cordials, yeah, it's 19 seating.

1338
01:22:55,657 --> 01:22:57,758
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I feel about it.

1339
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you guys feel about it.

1340
01:23:01,372 --> 01:23:04,476
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, beer and wine, they only needed 19 for that.

1341
01:23:04,536 --> 01:23:13,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want beer, wine, and cordial, which is another category, it should still apply, in my opinion, to the 19 seating.

1342
01:23:16,835 --> 01:23:18,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1343
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:23,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this sounds vaguely familiar that we discussed this a long time ago.

1344
01:23:25,196 --> 01:23:33,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it came out that your opinion, Bobby, I think was the same one as our prior chair.

1345
01:23:33,938 --> 01:23:41,479
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as they had malt and wine and whatever the minimum seating was at that time, he was okay.

1346
01:23:41,519 --> 01:23:46,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think where the precedent's already been there, I think we should stick with it.

1347
01:23:46,762 --> 01:23:49,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I think, I agree, I agree.

1348
01:23:50,065 --> 01:23:55,268
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody that has an existing license, they have to do a change of category.

1349
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:56,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Change of category, sure.

1350
01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:00,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if not, just apply for a new bearing line with cordials.

1351
01:24:01,013 --> 01:24:02,114
[SPEAKER_04]: With cordials, yeah.

1352
01:24:02,154 --> 01:24:06,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I think that's the only other thing I had.

1353
01:24:06,677 --> 01:24:07,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

1354
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,440
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel on it, Ben?

1355
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:14,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just thinking,

1356
01:24:17,063 --> 01:24:21,927
[SPEAKER_09]: The definite, the, sorry, what are the cordial definition is technically?

1357
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:24,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, let me show you what it is.

1358
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it here, I wrote it down.

1359
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:27,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1360
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just a type of.

1361
01:24:30,994 --> 01:24:35,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's in chapter 138, section one definition.

1362
01:24:35,558 --> 01:24:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a fruity.

1363
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a liquor or cordial.

1364
01:24:41,129 --> 01:25:02,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All alcoholic beverages manufactured or produced by mixing or redistilling neutral spirits, brandy, gin, or other distilled spirits with or over fruits, flowers, plants, cured juices, therefrom or other natural flavoring materials or with extracts derived from infusions.

1365
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:11,466
[SPEAKER_03]: percolations or maceration of such materials and containing no less than two and one half percent of sugar by weight.

1366
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:13,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a liquor.

1367
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:16,711
[SPEAKER_09]: So our opinion was it's like wine, sort of like a wine.

1368
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:23,076
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's like a sweet, yeah, weed alcoholic beverage.

1369
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:24,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It's higher in proof than a wine.

1370
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:32,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like a hard, whiskey, a bourbon, a rye.

1371
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I started keeping in mind or whatever with one of the craft beer, a craft beer that has a higher alcohol content.

1372
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:40,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1373
01:25:41,355 --> 01:25:41,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1374
01:25:42,115 --> 01:25:47,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't sell a distilled spirit, which is just a gin or a vodka or whatever.

1375
01:25:47,478 --> 01:25:47,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1376
01:25:47,718 --> 01:25:48,338
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1377
01:25:49,078 --> 01:26:00,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be something like, I imagine that, well, I've attempted to make lemon cello myself, and it's basically alcohol with sugar and lemon rind.

1378
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't use the actual lemon juice.

1379
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:06,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are exactly what I read.

1380
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:08,307
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's the sugar.

1381
01:26:08,387 --> 01:26:11,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an abundant amount of sugar in it.

1382
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:14,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got the flavoring of the rind of the lemon.

1383
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:27,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it falls into the category of liqueur and cordial because it's mixed with either vodka or straight alcohol and water, you know.

1384
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:30,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's kind of where it is.

1385
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:31,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fine line.

1386
01:26:32,441 --> 01:26:36,863
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some cordials out there that are, you know, 80 proof.

1387
01:26:37,303 --> 01:26:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

1388
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.

1389
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,564
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it was just a definition thing.

1390
01:26:42,604 --> 01:26:47,807
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, I'm in agreement with what you both say about it.

1391
01:26:47,908 --> 01:26:49,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I really am in agreement with that.

1392
01:26:51,510 --> 01:27:02,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And being kind of a guy looking for something to do every once in a while, I did a little revision, a very slight revision on the one day license application.

1393
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It just made it a little more user friendly and

1394
01:27:07,945 --> 01:27:21,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a chat with Gary about the fees, because it seems like there's no set way of paying for these licenses, and there's no way of really keeping track of who paid, who didn't pay, or whatever.

1395
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:36,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of the application is, you know, in Method License Commission, one-day liquor license requirements, one through eight, you know, it says we can, or one through seven, we can add in the number eight,

1396
01:27:36,896 --> 01:27:43,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It says fee, dollar sign, payables, the city of Medford, pay due on day of application.

1397
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:47,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So they apply for the license, attach a check for $60.

1398
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to worry about it.

1399
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:59,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says, number nine, the next one, licensee must notify license commission if event is canceled.

1400
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:05,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess a couple of times events have been canceled and you don't get your money back.

1401
01:28:06,283 --> 01:28:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, but you should have a credit.

1402
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:15,885
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Allen has seven or eight one day licenses a year and the other rain, they couldn't have it, blah, blah, blah.

1403
01:28:16,745 --> 01:28:17,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to cancel it.

1404
01:28:17,766 --> 01:28:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, we'll just credit you a $60 payment or whatever, you know, just trying to keep track of it.

1405
01:28:23,627 --> 01:28:29,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the very top, the date of event, the license, I just put right below it, rain date, if any.

1406
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way there, you're giving the person the opportunity to have a legitimate rain date

1407
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:40,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And this license is still good for that date if the original date wasn't used.

1408
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we kind of table that and let's talk about that at the end of the June meeting and buy it, you know?

1409
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:58,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I like tweaks, why not put it right there in writing so everyone sees what's expected or what they can expect.

1410
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:01,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I can email it to you guys so they can look it over.

1411
01:29:02,107 --> 01:29:07,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll email you guys and pull it apart, pick it apart, see what you think is good, not good, whatever.

1412
01:29:07,512 --> 01:29:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it seems reasonable.

1413
01:29:09,736 --> 01:29:20,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, anything we can do to lighten the load for Daria would be good too, you know, because she's got enough to do that she doesn't have to go chasing people for money.

1414
01:29:20,682 --> 01:29:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

1415
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:23,963
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1416
01:29:25,144 --> 01:29:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so if we're, Daria, we're all set, then I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1417
01:29:31,347 --> 01:29:35,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 2.31, according to my time.

1418
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get a second?

1419
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,121
[SPEAKER_07]: A second.

1420
01:29:39,581 --> 01:29:40,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1421
01:29:40,082 --> 01:29:40,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1422
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:40,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby.

1423
01:29:40,923 --> 01:29:41,303
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1424
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:42,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good to see everybody.

1425
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:46,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you all for your help and your participation.

1426
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:54,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, we'll we'll revisit what you are referring to Bobby at the June meeting and then we're we're off July and August.

1427
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:55,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
