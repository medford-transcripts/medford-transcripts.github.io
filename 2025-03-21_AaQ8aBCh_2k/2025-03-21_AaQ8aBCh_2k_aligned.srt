1
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:24,937
President DelaRusso.

2
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:27,858
Councilor Caviello.

3
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,018
Present.

4
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:29,538
Councilor Knight.

5
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:30,299
Present.

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,859
Vice President Lengelkern.

7
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,079
Present.

8
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:33,420
Councilor Marks.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,060
Present.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Councilor Penta.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,180
Present.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,001
President DelaRusso.

13
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:37,741
Present.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,441
Six present, one absent.

15
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,902
Please rise to salute the flag.

16
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:52,365
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,013
Before we start the meeting tonight, I have a very special announcement.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:11,678
Today we celebrate the occasion of the 75th, no, 61st, 39th anniversary of the birth of Robert Pento.

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,151
Commendations 15-084.

20
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:36,673
Commendation as was offered by Councilor Penta for Mr. Andrew Sano, the Rail Trooper of the Year.

21
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:44,075
So we'll invite Andrew up to the podium here and Councilor Penta up here as well to give the presentation.

22
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,935
Mr. Sano, you're welcome to come behind the rail.

23
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:07,865
that's broken.

24
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:09,467
Okay.

25
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:12,809
$150 million budget in the system is broken.

26
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,991
Well, anyway, um, I want to welcome you all here tonight.

27
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,033
Tonight is a very important night for our city of Medford.

28
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:22,596
Um, cause we have a whole host of things going on.

29
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:33,203
Um, beside Mr Sano, we're going to be talking about the arts and after that we'll be talking about a whole host of other things, but it doesn't happen very often that we have individuals who stand out

30
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,726
within our community for recognition.

31
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:44,230
But this gentleman's recognition, I believe, was a concerted effort with all his colleagues at Andrew Remax in Medford Square.

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,511
But fortunately for him, he won the standout.

33
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:57,055
It came as a result of a—you can correct me if I'm wrong—as a combination of, I believe, 15 realtor associations throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

34
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:02,298
But he received the number one award amongst over 20,000 realtors.

35
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,202
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

36
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:21,448
And that was predicated upon the fact that I believe he was nominated, or he was chosen as the Greater Boston Area Realtor of the Year, which put him into the direction of being the Massachusetts Greater Boston, or strike that, the Massachusetts Association Realtor of the Year.

37
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,928
It's a huge honor, I think.

38
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,549
It comes to us again in the city of Medford.

39
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,770
This is the third time in less than two years

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,359
that we have been recognized within our community by individuals.

41
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,844
The first one was Victor Garrow, as we all know, the wonderful job he did on a legal case.

42
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,269
Last year, it was Dr. Lepore on what he did on flute instruments.

43
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:48,377
This year, it's Andrew Sano as it relates to, you know, all three different professions, but all here in the city of Medford.

44
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,990
We do have a captive audience of intelligent people in this community.

45
00:03:52,571 --> 00:04:05,102
Unfortunately, the news media just doesn't play it the same way that individuals such as myself and members of this Memphis City Council on times recognize individuals for the good work and the deeds that they do within this community.

46
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:08,705
I would be less than not saying this.

47
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:12,809
In the audience is his cohorts, colleagues that you work with.

48
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,551
owner and operator, Andrew Veneziano, and those that work with him.

49
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:24,635
And I just think that just tells the whole story for the recognition that's being given here tonight, that Mr. Sano absolutely deserves what he's going to receive.

50
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:29,818
And it's nothing more than a, just a little plaque or another plaque.

51
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:38,122
It's, it's accommodation, but sometimes it's these little things that mean more than these big plaques and these big monstrous things that people get with their name on it.

52
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:43,839
To me, it's a big thing, because I'm a councilor, and nobody in the city can do this other than a city councilor.

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:59,392
So it reads as follows, that the Memphis City Council takes pleasure in making this council recommendation to Andrew Sano, Remax Andrew Realty Services, in recognition on being named the 2014 Massachusetts Realtor of the Year by the Massachusetts Association of Realtors.

54
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:03,576
Signed by Councilor DelaRusso, President, and myself, Councilor Robert Penta.

55
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:04,897
It's my honor, thank you.

56
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:14,231
Thank you.

57
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:19,115
Thank you, Councilor Penta, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, and the Council.

58
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,157
This is indeed a very big deal for me.

59
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:29,182
I'm a lifelong resident of Medford, and receiving the award from the State Board meant very much to me.

60
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:37,268
But honestly, to receive this from my hometown and this body means even more to me, and I'm deeply touched by it.

61
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:40,671
And it's my pleasure and my privilege to serve

62
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:45,021
the residents of the city of Medford in their pursuit of the American dream.

63
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,222
Thank you very much.

64
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:55,091
This is a treasure to me.

65
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,816
And his wife and kids are outside out in the audience.

66
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:01,998
Please stand and wave.

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,301
Congratulations.

68
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,205
Thank you very much.

69
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:03,854
Thank you.

70
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:06,177
motions, orders, and resolutions 15-429 offered by councillors Marks, Penta, and Lungo Kern.

71
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:17,761
Be it resolved that due to the wonderful involvement that the arts and humanities culture has been bringing to our city of Medford, the city's budget for the Medford Arts Council 2015-2016 be increased by 100%.

72
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,061
Who wants to speak on this first?

73
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:32,703
Councilor Marks.

74
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:35,185
Thank you, Mr. President.

75
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:41,970
And I want to thank my colleagues, Councilor Penter and Councilor Lungo-Kern for co-sponsoring this.

76
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:57,842
It was roughly two years ago, and I think many council members will remember Maria Daniels came before the council to express some interest of what's going on in the community regarding the yachts.

77
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:01,005
And also during her speech,

78
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:08,792
she said something pretty poignant at the time and said, it'd be a great idea to have some money incorporated within the budget.

79
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,415
And when she was done, we thanked her for coming up and she left.

80
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:18,780
And, um, I got together with my colleague, counselor Penter and said, you know what, what a novel idea.

81
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:29,628
Imagine having money allocated every year for a particular purpose, like every other allocation is in the budget, whether it's DPW or police, but to have something in there for the arts.

82
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:30,749
And,

83
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,466
We co-sponsored a resolution, myself and Councilor Penta.

84
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:38,969
It was supported by members of the council, which I am grateful for.

85
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:48,177
And at the time, we put it in there with the stipulation that we're not just going to put money out in the budget and say good luck to you.

86
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:49,699
We were going to revisit it.

87
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:58,186
And we said after a year or two of looking at it, we all felt strongly, and I can speak for myself and I think my colleagues,

88
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,566
The original amount was just to get us started.

89
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:24,452
And once we saw that there was interest, once we saw the money was being put to good use, once we saw that it was really outreaching to the community and the access throughout the community from these great programs was there, we said it was only normal that we would revisit the amount of money.

90
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,293
And we decided just recently to

91
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:32,354
ask for an appropriation to double the amount in the budget.

92
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:35,315
Now this is just a request coming from the council.

93
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:37,496
I hope we have a unanimous support here tonight.

94
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,497
It's a request for the mayor to include that within the budget.

95
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:43,559
I can only speak for myself as one member of the council.

96
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:52,182
I will not support a budget unless the funding is doubled or if the mayor wants to triple it, we'll be on board.

97
00:10:57,268 --> 00:11:26,467
So after reviewing the process, and I had the opportunity to go onto the Method Arts Council website, and it was very catching, the first paragraph on the website, and it said, we're a city-appointed agency of volunteers, working to promote excellence, access, education, and diversity in local public arts

98
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,991
and cultural programming.

99
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,933
So what better can you spend money on in a community?

100
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:40,578
And I would venture to say that this particular amount that is allocated is probably our biggest bang for our buck within the budget.

101
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:47,042
This reaches thousands of people, every different socioeconomic group in the community.

102
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,903
It reaches out to nonprofits.

103
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,844
It reaches out to school-age children.

104
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,525
It reaches the gambit.

105
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,207
And I also took it one step further in

106
00:11:56,668 --> 00:12:01,651
went through the 56 grants that were awarded in 2015.

107
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:22,865
And if my colleagues would indulge me, I think, and I'm not going to read them all, but I think when you look at the diversity and the nature of the programs and the funding, how it reaches every aspect of our community, it really is amazing what can be done with such a small amount of money and with volunteers.

108
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:36,292
And, you know, I have visions someday of, you know, I won't bring hash old stuff, but the Swan School that we tried to turn into an art center many years ago.

109
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:47,601
But I have visions someday of possibly looking at Springstep and saying, geez, here we have a building within 50 yards of City Hall, centrally located,

110
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,610
It was built to house the arts.

111
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,872
What better can we have than having a community asset like that?

112
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,894
And that's, I know, in the big picture.

113
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:02,376
But I think we have so many unique opportunities.

114
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:16,164
About three months ago, I offered a resolution that was supported by this council to repurpose the bus shelter, which is at the corner of River Street and Riverside Ave, behind the old burial ground.

115
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,514
to turn that into an open air art center.

116
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:25,798
And I think we have the unique opportunity to take that area that's already out there.

117
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:27,178
We already have seating.

118
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:31,681
There's already a shelter there that we could enclose or encapsulate.

119
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:35,364
And we could do so much with that little particular area.

120
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,125
And that was just one thought that came to mind.

121
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:45,730
And we did ask the mayor, through our resolution, to look into repurposing that shelter for the purpose of the arts.

122
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:54,820
But I did, not to get off subject, I wanted to go through just a couple of these quick grant awards that were mentioned.

123
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:59,064
And my colleagues are all aware of this, so I'm not trying to sell them.

124
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:09,015
But I think the community as a whole really need to know what goes on on an everyday basis through volunteers.

125
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,283
And if you look at some of the grants, Andrews Middle School, the Museum of Science Style Lab.

126
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:18,425
We had Laura Barrington, the Kids Open Mic.

127
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:23,488
We had Brooks Elementary School, orchestrating kids through the classics.

128
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,090
Cachet, the Arts Across Method.

129
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,611
Cachet Circled the Square.

130
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:37,597
We had Dennis Cormier, Hands on History of the American Revolutionary War.

131
00:14:38,232 --> 00:15:07,467
Laura Duggan, The Virtue of Penelope, A Chinese Odyssey, Ian Frenning Kasuth, Hicks Ave, Mural Project, Friends of the Chevalier Auditorium, The Barrow and McNeil's Concert, MACI, Meffitt Film Collaborative, MACI, Making Art Together, Children and Their Families, The Meffitt Arts Council Media, Multimedia Cultural Exchange, Meffitt Historical Society, The African American Faces of the Civil War, The Meffitt Public Library,

132
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:25,616
D. Morris, Method Is Home, Roberts Elementary School, Stuart Little, The Musical, The Royal House Slave Quarters, Compelled to Servitude, Story of Belinda, Shelley Gross, The Middle School, Drama, The Preschool Children, West Method Open Studios,

133
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,817
And the list goes on and on and on.

134
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,919
And I am proud here tonight.

135
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,081
It's the first time I've ever offered to double a budget line item.

136
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,602
But it's appropriate at this particular point.

137
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:45,483
The money's being well spent.

138
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,564
It's serving thousands of people in our community.

139
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:49,745
It's growing.

140
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,626
And I foresee this particular line item

141
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,906
to continue to grow.

142
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,067
I foresee the outreach to continue in our community.

143
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:05,692
And I look forward to the future opportunities of expanding our arts within our community.

144
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,814
And I look forward to hearing what my other colleagues have to say.

145
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:11,956
Thank you, Councilor Lox.

146
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:13,136
Councilor Penderkin.

147
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:14,517
Councilor Penderkin.

148
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,720
When we decided to go on this endeavor, we figured,

149
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,818
How do we sell this to double the budget?

150
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,139
And I'm saying to myself, this is really not a hard sell.

151
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,801
Because number one, we have $6.5 million in free cash.

152
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,322
That's an awful lot of money to have in free cash.

153
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,924
And all we're asking is to double $15,000 to $30,000.

154
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:38,266
So $15,000 is already going to be accounted for from last year's budget to include $30,000.

155
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,767
But I look at it in this point of view.

156
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:44,889
I'm looking at where has Medford been as compared to where is Medford going?

157
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,651
We just gave an award here tonight to the Realtor of the Year.

158
00:16:49,618 --> 00:17:05,770
The biggest asset that we have in this community in selling real estate is to have people come to the City of Method, not because of its close proximity to Boston, for which it's a big seller, but the fact that we have a public school education that people believe in and trust.

159
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:12,636
We have an arts and cultural program that is now beginning to take hold and hit another group of people in this community.

160
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,277
And lastly, and more importantly,

161
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:15,934
It's what your taxes are paying for.

162
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,355
This is what you should be getting for your taxes.

163
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:22,196
And you know, when you ask for something, you probably say, how are we going to get it?

164
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:23,036
Well, we can pay for it.

165
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,517
This is something that can be very easily paid for.

166
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,460
Now, I know Councilman Marks has a whole list of organizations that are credible and worthy.

167
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,400
But think about it.

168
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,001
Think about all those organizations that he's talking about.

169
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:43,565
And when you list your house to sell it, or when they list it to buy it, having all those organizations as part of a selling point to be competitive.

170
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:48,627
We're sitting next to sister cities of Malden, Somerville, Lexington, Winchester.

171
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:49,949
We can't be there.

172
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:50,689
We won't be there.

173
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:51,490
But you know something?

174
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,952
We can be ourselves.

175
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:56,735
And what we can offer to this community is something that no one else can offer.

176
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,037
And that's togetherness.

177
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:06,365
And that's making sure that this city moves forward in a cultural, in an educational, and in a direction that really is going to bring Meffitt tomorrow.

178
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:17,277
Developing our downtown areas, having organizations such as this, whether you go to West Memphis and you have the open studios, or whether, as he said, maybe someday having a storefront that's good for the arts.

179
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,718
What's wrong with that?

180
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,879
But there has to be a coming together.

181
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:29,305
We as a community now realize this is a huge change that's gonna be taking place in our community, with a new mayor coming into office.

182
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,487
But not to talk about politics, but you have to talk about it.

183
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:34,629
And this is what you should be looking at

184
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:53,264
No matter who the candidate might be running for this office, what's their commitment to the arts, to the culture, to the education, to the revitalization of this community, of getting itself back on the street, on a street that you're just not paying taxes for over and over again, that you're getting something for your tax dollars.

185
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:55,166
And that's how I'm looking at this.

186
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,487
I think this is not only creditable, it's worthwhile.

187
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,369
You know, this past, was it this past Sunday?

188
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,511
Two Sundays ago, we were at the Royal House.

189
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:06,089
And we saw a great performance that the arts put on.

190
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,112
Something that maybe a lot of people might not have an interest, but what about the people that do have an interest?

191
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,172
They don't know what it's about.

192
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:17,255
When Councillor Longo-Curran offered that resolution to thank them for their service, you know, it was great.

193
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,576
There was almost like 100 people there that day.

194
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:22,218
It was a great, and it was a Sunday afternoon.

195
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:24,439
Where would you normally see this in the past?

196
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:35,781
You know, whether you have Cache, whether you have Circle the Square, whether you have the Arts, whether you have the Historical Society, or whether you have all these parent-teacher groups, this is your time to galvanize and mobilize.

197
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:43,886
This is your time to find out who your mayor is and what that mayor should be for this community, because the time for the change is now.

198
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:57,064
I think Councilor Longo currently is next, Mr. President.

199
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,106
I'll be brief.

200
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,107
Thank you, President De La Russo.

201
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:08,770
I just want to echo the sentiments that Council Marks and Council Pinto have already said so well.

202
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:21,376
I think adding to the arts in the community, number one, has been extremely effective to bringing out people, diversity, young, we have

203
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:28,244
so many programs that have been able to be funded which benefit the whole community.

204
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:32,507
I'll pick out one, which is Cache, which Maya and my family are very fond of.

205
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:51,662
You have a cultural event that brings out hundreds, hundreds of young families to Medford Square, which so badly needs people traversing the sidewalks, going into businesses, having cultural events and performances and

206
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,458
events for the children.

207
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:59,640
I think adding to this line item, which I, too, you know, I'm not one to always add money.

208
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,782
We're always watchdogs on the budget.

209
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:11,205
But I think it's something that has benefited and can continue to grow and continue to benefit everybody that lives in this community.

210
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,486
And I, too, was at the Royal House.

211
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:14,847
It was, you know, a great event.

212
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:19,389
And what Maria Daniels and what Cachet and I would

213
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:46,083
I know Mrs. Scuderi's involved in the arts, and I can't name everybody, but there are so many people who are interested in arts and are interested in teaching and bringing that across the city, and I think it's wonderful, and I think this is something that is gonna, it's an investment for our future, and it's an investment for the arts community to show what they have for us, and we're lucky and fortunate to have people that wanna carry this out and do better for the city.

214
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:50,960
I'm in full support, and I'm sure all my colleagues will be in support.

215
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,282
And I hope this comes to fruition.

216
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,070
Thank you, Mr. President.

217
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:12,437
You know, being a person who's a third generation in this community, when I grew up, we never had any ads.

218
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,079
I mean, all we ever had was, you know, sports.

219
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,360
You know, you have Little League.

220
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:19,524
That was the extent of your youth culture.

221
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,425
It was never really anywhere else.

222
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:24,406
It was mostly boy things and nothing for women to do.

223
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:31,568
And now, as I've grown, I've seen this community change and become more diverse.

224
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:32,528
We're going through the change.

225
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:35,149
More and more younger families are coming through here.

226
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:36,930
And you're watching our community grow.

227
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,050
And so I'm watching.

228
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,591
I have family that still live here.

229
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,472
I have grandchildren that are growing up in this community.

230
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,013
And I'm happy that, besides the sporting things that they could do,

231
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:54,497
As they go to the schools, there's going to be things for them to do, different types of culture they're going to learn that I never had the opportunity to learn.

232
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:56,598
So I applaud this group for doing this.

233
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:57,999
I'm part of this group also.

234
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:12,786
And I support the full funding for them, same as my other colleagues.

235
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,087
Mr. President, thank you very much.

236
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:15,568
First of all, I'd like to

237
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:19,014
take the opportunity to thank the Arts Council for such good work.

238
00:23:20,014 --> 00:23:29,479
If they weren't so committed to this endeavor, if they weren't so quickly able to efficiently implement some successful programming, then this resolution would never be before us.

239
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:33,221
So thank you very much for doing the best that you can with the little that you've been provided.

240
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:45,267
I think it's very important that when we look at the future of Medford and we look at the vision for Medford that we understand that the arts has to have a major role.

241
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,711
and the future development of the city of Medford, Mr. President.

242
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:49,512
This money is being well spent.

243
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,194
An increase of $15,000 is a start.

244
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:56,056
It allows us to build on the strong foundation that this organization has provided us.

245
00:23:56,616 --> 00:24:03,240
And I certainly need to take the time to commend Councilor Marks, Councilor Pater, and Councilor Lungo for putting this resolution forward.

246
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,962
I too stand in full support of this resolution.

247
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:13,206
I think it only makes sense for us to increase the funding in the arts community based upon the measurable successes that are in place right now.

248
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,474
And I think that's very important that we look at it this way.

249
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:17,974
There are measurable successes.

250
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:21,215
We're not just giving money to an organization to spend.

251
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:26,956
We're giving money to an organization to spend because they've shown us how well they're able to utilize this funding.

252
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:33,978
So, Mr. President, with all due respect to the body, I'd move for approval on this matter ASAP.

253
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:38,199
I'd like to have the residents and the citizenry have an opportunity to speak on it.

254
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:41,720
But in terms of supporting this resolution, I'm wholeheartedly behind it.

255
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,550
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

256
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:55,153
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

257
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:55,733
Thank you.

258
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,474
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I stand in support of this.

259
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:04,896
These folks won me over when I first saw the electric boxes all painted over nice.

260
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:11,259
When I went to the farmer's market and they had musicians playing that I could just sit there for free.

261
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,640
This is about class.

262
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,961
This opens up when you do these free things,

263
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:22,134
at the Condon Shell, you invite everybody for nothing.

264
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,315
If they want to buy something, they can buy something.

265
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:28,416
But if they don't have any money in their pockets, they can be a part of this community.

266
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:30,056
That is huge.

267
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:34,137
And we are at a crossroads right now in the city of Medford.

268
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:38,998
We have a, to use one of their expressions, a blank canvas on this city right now.

269
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:41,399
And we can make it look like anything we want.

270
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,762
We have an open canvas.

271
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:47,548
And one of the things that I like about these people is that they can take

272
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:49,768
Medford Square first.

273
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,489
They need to do it in Medford Square.

274
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,631
And you're going to hear me talk about, you know, not the other square down in West Medford, OK?

275
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
I want you to do it in Medford Square.

276
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:59,313
And then I want you to take it to Haines Square.

277
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:05,436
And I want you people to come to Haines Square and make the boxes look nice, make the storefronts look nice.

278
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:10,178
I want you to bring energy to Haines Square after you get done with Medford Square.

279
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:17,022
And I also would say that because if you have a vibrant Medford Square, you have tax dollars.

280
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:24,857
Tax dollars that can then pay for the police department that needs to be completely torn down and built up new.

281
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,117
Because where is the money going to come from?

282
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:36,280
It's going to come from the engines of the businesses in Medford Square and Haines Square, South Medford Square, and Hillside.

283
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,840
That's where the money is going to come from.

284
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,641
So we need to have the businesses come out, and these people can generate that business.

285
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,562
They can open up coffee shops, they can open up

286
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,011
you know, vegetable smoothie shops.

287
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,131
I don't care what they open up.

288
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:51,653
I don't care.

289
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,834
It brings money in.

290
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:57,597
It brings money into the city, and if they want a bike path, just do it safely.

291
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,239
I've learned to accept certain things.

292
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,362
And I just want you to bring that energy to Medford Square, and then I want you to bring it to Haines Square.

293
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,724
And as far as a home, they deserve a home.

294
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:11,067
But I wouldn't use this place down over here, I know.

295
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:12,008
Sorry.

296
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,490
I would use the library.

297
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:25,005
The reason why I would use the library is because the library, in my mind, is an institution that symbolically, while not always is used today, symbolically is about class.

298
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,189
knowledge, and it's about access to knowledge.

299
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:35,434
And so if we put another floor on top of the current library, you guys could make a space up there.

300
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,535
We already own the building.

301
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:45,643
All you gotta do is add a floor, and then you guys can have a community unity space, call it whatever you want, and you can have a home, because you deserve one.

302
00:27:45,823 --> 00:27:47,605
And you deserve one in the middle of the square.

303
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,227
I want everything in the middle of the square.

304
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,029
And the other thing that I have to say is,

305
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:03,055
There is $300,000 sitting in the community access, what do you call it, access, that TV access.

306
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:11,919
$300,000, and now that we don't have to accept half a loaf because the mayor's leaving, we might not have to have it up at the Volk.

307
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:19,223
We could, might, take it down to the city square and put the access station in the city square because we're not dealing with the mayor.

308
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:21,684
We don't have to abide by his rule anymore.

309
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:32,769
So maybe in the new future, instead of putting it up at the Vogue, which I'm not against, but if you're really looking at it as community access, putting it in Medford Square will also help these people with the arts.

310
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:37,851
It's a great place to be unified with the Chevalier, and everything's matching up.

311
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,972
Everything's just coming together like the stars.

312
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:42,473
The stars are starting to align in Medford, so thank you.

313
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,159
Thank you, Mr. President.

314
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:57,603
You know, Gene, I don't always agree with what you say, but tonight you were 100% correct in what you said about the library.

315
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:01,766
The library is in dire need of help and repair.

316
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:04,668
You are 100% correct.

317
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:15,035
That place, you put a second floor there, remodel and expand that, that is the exact place where this art community belongs, because the library is the hub of culture and learning.

318
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:17,677
Thank you, Counselor Caviell.

319
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:21,358
Sir, if you'd like to speak, please state your name and address for the record.

320
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:23,899
I'm Gary Roberts, 60 Sharon Street.

321
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm the chair of the Medford Arts Council.

322
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:32,784
First of all, I want to thank all of you for your foresight in putting forward this resolution and your confidence in our work.

323
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:37,727
I also want to acknowledge my colleagues on the Arts Council who are here.

324
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:41,989
It was stated before eloquently by several of you that we are volunteers.

325
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:55,811
working very hard for Medford, for the public, for the community, for seniors, for kids, for many, many different anchor cultural organizations in the city.

326
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:08,594
We do this year round and I think that there are some incredible strategic opportunities for our group and all of the groups that are contributing to this effort.

327
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:13,277
So this small increase is really going to make a huge difference.

328
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:20,703
Over the last two years, we funded over 100 different projects with just a little bit more than $60,000.

329
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:25,767
So a little bit is going a very long way in Medford.

330
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:31,872
The kind of work that we're supporting has a well-known multiplier effect for the local economy.

331
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:38,214
along with our religious institutions, our sports teams, our political activities.

332
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:52,137
These are essential components of our civic life, and the arts and humanities also are basically presenting opportunities for personal development and growth for every Medford citizen who takes part in them.

333
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:56,399
So thanks again for this resolution.

334
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,699
We need a lot more.

335
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,160
Going back to 1998,

336
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:05,668
Our funding history shows that, on average, our shortfall is 53%.

337
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:15,596
That means that, in any given year, we can't even support a half of the need in the community.

338
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:28,768
So every bit of money that's entrusted to us is needed, and we will continue to be great stewards of this investment in the community.

339
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:29,068
Thanks.

340
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:37,720
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

341
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,801
Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

342
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:43,023
I'm Aimee Acubrock, 16, Glenwood Ave, Medford.

343
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:50,408
Well, I think it's fair to say that we are in an arts revolution.

344
00:31:52,370 --> 00:32:03,858
And first and foremost, I'd like to thank Councilors Lungo Keown, Michael Marks, and Bob Penta for bringing up this resolution.

345
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:06,763
this evening to increase the city's funding.

346
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:18,487
I can speak of the importance and the need for this funding from first-hand experience with regard to Cachet and Medford.

347
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:30,851
In our early stage as a grassroots movement in 2010, the Medford Arts Council awarded us the first funding for our organization.

348
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:33,052
They believed in us.

349
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:38,497
If that had not happened, CACHE probably would not exist today.

350
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:53,186
Each year since then, CACHE has been recognized and received funding for our major programs, Arts Across Medford, Mr. Griffith Celebration, and Circle the Square.

351
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:02,112
These awards are critical to our financial stability.

352
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:27,223
Cache, like the other organizations here representing nonprofits, we have to depend on the community, generous donors, companies to provide us with the money to carry out our programs and to pick up on what Councilor Mark said about volunteers.

353
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:31,405
I want to congratulate and thank

354
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:37,600
everyone in this audience tonight, because they are all volunteers.

355
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,487
And I think they should stand up and get an applause.

356
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:08,628
We would not have the rich culture that we have in this community without volunteers.

357
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:26,233
So, not only does the Methodist Council provide essential funding, but from the very beginning, they have been a very valuable partner to CACHE, providing guidance and a working relationship.

358
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:48,468
And as Councilor Marks did, if you look at the programs that were funded in 2015, you will see that in addition to eight grants for the Medford Public Library, eight grants, and 15 awards for our public schools.

359
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,092
These are funds ranging from $200 to $500

360
00:34:56,196 --> 00:35:06,601
dollars being given also to individual artists and instructors such as Dance Caliante, Eileen Herman House.

361
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:14,145
And Kids Open Mic, Laura Brereton.

362
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:18,927
That's only to mention a few.

363
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,309
There were over 50 awards made in 2015.

364
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:40,923
And there are many, many individual artists in that group who, without that $200, or whatever it may be, would never be able to carry on their programs because they just don't have that kind of money.

365
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:54,072
So in the year 2000, at the beginning of the millennium,

366
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:59,605
I'm sort of known as a person who likes quotes.

367
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,448
I think the board of directors of Cachet could attest to that.

368
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:10,109
When I send them emails, I always send them a quote.

369
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,951
And this is one of my favorites, which happens to be by Hillary Clinton.

370
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:20,473
No political intention here.

371
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:45,121
We in America have to recognize that as we stand on the brink of a new century, we are likely to be judged far more in the future by our arts and our culture than by anything else we might do or say.

372
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:47,623
And I believe that's true.

373
00:36:48,284 --> 00:36:49,885
I don't think I sent that one out lately.

374
00:36:54,682 --> 00:37:11,327
To close, I thank you again for putting this resolution on the table because by providing these additional monies to the Medford Arts Council, we will be supporting more arts and culture throughout the entire city.

375
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:23,651
It could not go to a better place because this money, as was said by Michael, Council Marks, and by Gary Roberts, this is going to reach out throughout the community.

376
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:34,393
not only does the arts enrich our community, but it also supports our local businesses.

377
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:43,895
And that is also one of the important features of having an arts community.

378
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:49,296
So thank you very, very much, and I certainly hope this will be approved.

379
00:37:57,987 --> 00:37:58,367
Good evening.

380
00:37:58,427 --> 00:37:59,988
Please state your name and address for the record.

381
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,210
Good evening, Mr. President.

382
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,934
My name is John Stroller, and I reside at 20 Metcalf Street here in Medford.

383
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:18,943
I want to begin by being very careful in saying that I am in support of funding for the arts, but my remarks may suggest otherwise.

384
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:20,284
It's not true.

385
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:27,429
I've been known to dabble in poetry myself, so that I do support the arts, but my concern

386
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,664
is the funding and the compensation.

387
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:37,825
This is one thing I want to say to the people here representing the arts that, um, you've come to the wrong place.

388
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:51,649
Unfortunately, what you ought to do is gather a dozen of you and go up to the, uh, office of the budget director who is at this very moment writing the budget and make sure

389
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:58,468
that she inserts some funding for the arts, make sure that there is a line item there for it.

390
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:00,790
But I also want to pay for it.

391
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:11,197
Uh, the, uh, this city council has no authority to increase the budget, cannot do it and will not do it.

392
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:14,219
However, they do have the authority to compensate for that.

393
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:22,697
If we pay, by the way, Councilor Marks, can you enlighten me on how much the funding was for the arts last year?

394
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,820
$15,000, which is a pittance, really.

395
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:39,607
But I think that if you take that $15,000, you ought to, on the other hand, reduce the budget by $15,000.

396
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:43,629
You've got to find a line item where you should do that.

397
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:45,085
at the same time.

398
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:51,346
And otherwise, that funding will come from the people.

399
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:58,527
There are people in this city who are looking for funding for sending their children to college.

400
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:01,588
This money is coming directly from them.

401
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:05,409
We have a $151 million budget.

402
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:06,949
It is excessive.

403
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:08,489
It's going to increase.

404
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:12,250
The budget may increase by another $5 million.

405
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:18,519
We will be up to, say, $156 million or so.

406
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,100
This is an increase in taxes.

407
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:26,703
And the taxes all come, eventually, from the people.

408
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:36,688
So if this council wants to help the people of Medford, actually, rather than a fortunate few,

409
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:44,121
Uh, it ought to be very careful about the budget and you've got to find a way to reduce the line items.

410
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:46,042
You've got to do it correctly.

411
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:50,767
You've got to take advice from the solicitor who will tell you exactly how to do it.

412
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,228
Make no errors.

413
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:55,271
If you can, you'll be doing a lot of good.

414
00:40:56,512 --> 00:41:01,597
We've got a budget director who is a spender, has been a spender all her life.

415
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:12,277
20 years in service has, has voted for every single tax increase during that time has written budgets that have done that.

416
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:27,925
So if the arts people want more funding and they want to get it directly, you must go to the office of the budget director and ask for it.

417
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:30,767
Make sure that it's in the budget in the first place.

418
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:36,039
Because if it's not in the budget, the council cannot increase it.

419
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,021
Thank you very much.

420
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:43,706
Thank you, Dr. Stirella.

421
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:44,366
Councillor Knight.

422
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:45,707
No, thank you, Councillor.

423
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:46,328
All set?

424
00:41:46,428 --> 00:41:46,688
Yes.

425
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:49,731
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

426
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:54,954
Good evening, my name is David McKillop Sr., 94 Rock Glen Road.

427
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:58,396
I'm just going to give you a perspective from a business point of view.

428
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:07,762
My business, although I live in Medford, resides in Salem, and I'm in a community, a business community, with a city that gets the arts.

429
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:16,287
Just to give you some simple examples, and I want to just elaborate afterwards, is the dead of winter in February, we had the Chocolate Festival.

430
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:17,988
I can tell you that it was a lot of fun.

431
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:23,228
It was an enjoyable time, and a lot of people came on on the weekends to see ice sculptures throughout the entire city.

432
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:28,210
Following that, in March, we had the Poetry, uh, the, uh, Independent Film Festival.

433
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:36,152
Thousands of people showed up to just come to our one theater in Salem to visit and see independent films and vote on their best films.

434
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,353
After that, we had the Poetry Festival just this past weekend.

435
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:45,095
The Poetry Festival brought thousands of people into town, rain or shine, it didn't matter.

436
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:46,675
Now, coming up,

437
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,380
We have the Jazz Festival.

438
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,005
The Jazz Festival brings thousands and thousands of people weekend after weekend into the city of Salem.

439
00:42:56,006 --> 00:43:01,390
That's just a small example of what the arts can do in helping business and helping communities.

440
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,133
You have $151 million budget.

441
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:07,375
I heard we have $6 million of funny money.

442
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:11,318
I think that you guys are 100% on the right track.

443
00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:15,521
One of the things that would concern me as a resident of the city of Medford

444
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:29,673
is that this downtown is now struggling because you're fighting with two monsters, retail spaces, one in Assembly Square and Station Landing, which we happen to have, but the downtown is struggling.

445
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,935
And the only way to bring that back is to have the uniqueness of

446
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:34,102
the arts.

447
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:38,464
Because those areas can't do that like a downtown city can do that.

448
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:39,684
So it's got to be done right.

449
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:41,145
It's got to be done craftfully.

450
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,366
It's got to be done thoughtfully.

451
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:47,408
I think you have a tremendous amount of volunteers that want to make that happen.

452
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,749
And my last note is I think you should double the double.

453
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,509
Thank you.

454
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,501
This is seed money, and we're talking about $15,000.

455
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:10,544
We're talking about $15,000 in a $150 million budget.

456
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:11,925
This is seed money.

457
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:17,868
And we are going to have a casino to fund things around here pretty soon.

458
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:18,928
We have lottery money.

459
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:20,369
That's dirty money, if you ask me.

460
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:21,029
It's dirty money.

461
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,050
This is clean money.

462
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:24,728
This is clean money.

463
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,089
This is going to be vibrant, clean money.

464
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:31,290
We thought that the mass lottery was going to save the schools at one time.

465
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,330
I remember when it was all like, woo, we're going to have the lottery.

466
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,870
It didn't save the schools.

467
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:37,251
This is clean money.

468
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:40,171
I just want to let you people know that this is clean money.

469
00:44:40,631 --> 00:44:41,752
And I think it's a great thing.

470
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:44,072
And I think that they should be allowed to have a space.

471
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:44,872
It's $15,000 a year.

472
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:45,232
That's it.

473
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:45,492
Ma'am?

474
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:56,327
Hi, I'm Sam Sednick, 181 Kennedy Drive.

475
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,430
If you haven't met me, I'm one of your local librarians.

476
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:07,257
And I'm here to support the Med for Arts Council because they have supported us so very, very much.

477
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:10,400
I think someone mentioned that we got eight grants this year.

478
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:18,187
And that goes towards programming for children and teenagers and adults during their vacation times.

479
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:23,057
after school, and I don't really feel like I need to sell this to you.

480
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:36,951
You all sound like you support arts programming pretty much, but just in case you weren't aware, in terms of, as an educator, in the modern era, it's no longer about traditional literacy.

481
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:37,872
It's now about

482
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,956
21st century literacies, that's across the board.

483
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:47,944
You're talking science and technology, arts and visual literacy, information literacy, digital literacy.

484
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:56,034
And as an educator, it's sometimes overwhelming trying to teach and reach out to children on all of these different levels.

485
00:45:56,582 --> 00:46:02,972
But the one thing that crosses the board on all literacies is arts education.

486
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:12,366
Studies have shown that children who have access to arts education are four times as likely to have higher academic achievement.

487
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,352
They're four times as likely to participate in science and mathematic programs.

488
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,633
And they're three times as likely to be elected to class office.

489
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:28,017
And I know there's an election coming up, so if you counselors would like to try that out for adults as well, you're welcome to try.

490
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:36,260
So what little funding has been given to the Medford Arts Council goes a really long way.

491
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,742
In April, we just had a puppet

492
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:43,373
come in and work with children during April vacation.

493
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:50,576
The children learned how to make puppets, they learned how to move puppets, and at the end of April vacation, they put on a puppet show for other children.

494
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:55,058
It was an awesome program, and we couldn't have done it without the Medford Arts Council.

495
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,660
They also bond other community groups together.

496
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:09,184
I have a program coming up this Saturday, actually, where the Medford Library and the Medford Family Network are going together with low-income families to the Museum of Fine Arts because of Medford.

497
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:11,043
Arts Council funding.

498
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:26,188
We're getting a special tour of the museum and getting children who don't normally have access to that sort of arts education a real experience that they might not otherwise be able to afford.

499
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:29,089
So thank you so much for considering arts funding.

500
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,149
We really appreciate it.

501
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:31,470
Thank you.

502
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:34,191
Councilor Caraviello.

503
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

504
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:38,252
Mr. McKillop, can I ask you a question?

505
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:44,025
In the town of Salem, the city hall, is there a department that handles arts?

506
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:46,006
Yes, absolutely.

507
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:49,648
Yes, there's a downtown representative that handles the arts.

508
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:51,769
So in the city hall, there is an art department.

509
00:47:52,190 --> 00:48:02,475
Well, hopefully, with our new administration coming in, there'll be a little more forward thinking and incorporate that as a new department coming into the city.

510
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:13,667
You are correct.

511
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,589
They say if you have an office that goes out there and looks for money, you find money.

512
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:28,578
And number two, the children of this community, I had the chance to work with Sam last year with the literacy program.

513
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,322
You people don't know how lucky we are in this community to have Sam.

514
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:37,987
She's transformed that children's department, that library, 1,000%.

515
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:43,270
And I'm looking forward to working with Sam again in a few weeks on our literacy program.

516
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,452
Sam, I want to thank you for the great work you've done for the library and the children of Medford.

517
00:48:52,894 --> 00:48:54,075
Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

518
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,316
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

519
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:59,337
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford.

520
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:03,319
Councilor Caravaglio and Councilor Marks brought up Springstep.

521
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:06,956
And realistically, can we get sponsorship?

522
00:49:07,016 --> 00:49:10,797
Can there be a community organizer who can bring different groups together?

523
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:13,477
This is too good to be something else.

524
00:49:14,278 --> 00:49:16,278
I think the Springstep building is very valuable.

525
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,219
I think these people coming out here tonight, you never see this at the city council.

526
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:20,839
God bless them.

527
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,780
It's so important for people to show up here.

528
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,581
And Dr. Stirella, I love what you have to say.

529
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:32,823
And you're right, the budget director is important, but people coming up here and voicing their opinions at the People's Forum,

530
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:35,548
It's the only avenue we have.

531
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:37,468
Springstep, I love the idea.

532
00:49:37,648 --> 00:49:45,112
I hope we can all come up with an idea to buy that and let's fund it through sponsorship if the city's not gonna act on it.

533
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:51,934
Thank you.

534
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:52,775
Anybody else?

535
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:56,736
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

536
00:49:57,737 --> 00:50:00,178
Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

537
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,041
On that motion, one more speaker.

538
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:13,083
Good evening, please state your name and address for the record.

539
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:17,304
I'm Sondra DeVita and I live in 67 West Street and I think you should

540
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:38,320
fund them because I like art and music and I know a lot of other people do and it would be nice to have that.

541
00:50:51,904 --> 00:50:56,108
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, roll call vote has been requested.

542
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:57,369
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

543
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,771
Councilor Camuso?

544
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,292
Councilor Caviello?

545
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:00,472
Yes.

546
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:01,673
Councilor Knight?

547
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:02,154
Yes.

548
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,036
Vice President Lungo-Kern?

549
00:51:04,056 --> 00:51:04,116
Yes.

550
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:05,457
Councilor Mox?

551
00:51:05,817 --> 00:51:05,977
Yes.

552
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:07,239
Councilor Penta?

553
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:07,359
Yes.

554
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,621
President De La Ruzo?

555
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:10,482
Yes.

556
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,404
A vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

557
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:14,686
The motion passes.

558
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:15,767
Congratulations.

559
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:42,024
Thank you all for coming tonight, and thank you all for your support and involvement in the community.

560
00:51:42,044 --> 00:51:46,085
15-430, offered by Councilor Penta.

561
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:52,748
Be it resolved that Medford resident, Albert Mussolini,

562
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:54,172
Mastacusa.

563
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:55,112
Mastacusa.

564
00:51:55,753 --> 00:52:11,036
Be congratulated and conferred with a council citation on the occasion of receiving the country of France's most prestigious honor, that being the Chevalier Medal of the French Legion of Honor.

565
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:13,337
You want to just, wait a minute, let them.

566
00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:40,375
This prestigious honor being the Chevalier Medal of the French Legion of Honor.

567
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:50,478
This award is in recognition of Mr. Mastercuse's American service during France's liberation during World War II at the invasion of Normandy.

568
00:52:51,508 --> 00:53:00,852
This honor places another wonderful distinction for the city of Medford and our veterans who so bravely defended freedom wherever the call.

569
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:01,712
Counselor Penta.

570
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:06,014
Mr. President, this is part of a triple play of recognition here tonight.

571
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:16,338
Mr. Massachusetts, who was in his 90s, received this award most recently, and he received it by the president of France, who happened to be here, I believe, in the city of Medford.

572
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:21,020
It was established by Napoleon Bonaparte back in 1802, and it was given in recognition

573
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:30,805
of those individuals who were either in the service or they were civilians, as well as soldiers, who participated in the freedom of France.

574
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:38,848
This is the highest decorative award that can be received, that the country of France acknowledges to individuals.

575
00:53:39,568 --> 00:53:48,432
And it was originally given to nationals, but for non-nationals, which what Mr. Mastercuser was, is, they subsequently, the country of France subsequently recognized

576
00:53:48,843 --> 00:53:55,086
the true value of not only our American soldiers, but all soldiers who came to their defense, especially during World War II.

577
00:53:55,607 --> 00:54:05,052
Mr. Massachusetts, as I said, he's in his 90s, and I would hope he'll be able to find some day in the future to come before the council to receive this award.

578
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:11,976
From President Holland, H-O-L-L-A-N-D-E, from France, is the gentleman who gave us this award.

579
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:15,518
Now, to be a chevalier is one of five degrees.

580
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,199
It's like a degrees of the award, and I believe

581
00:54:18,664 --> 00:54:20,725
And this is the highest level of the award.

582
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:33,633
Also, Mr. President, I think it would be a great accomplishment, again, for the city of Medford to have to boast about in its downstairs office of its Veterans Affairs of another decorative American.

583
00:54:34,373 --> 00:54:43,758
Apparently, for some reason or another, this had been lying amiss, gathering some dust, so to speak, and it finally came to the forefront in the country of France.

584
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,560
And Mr. Mastercut, he's a very

585
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:48,660
quiet individual, if anybody knows him.

586
00:54:49,741 --> 00:55:08,274
And I guess he was overtaken with so much joy and pride, for not only he and his family, but the fact that it's another Medford veteran, it's another Medford citizen who not only received this award, but the nice part about receiving this award, it came from a country, the country of France, who appreciated the fact that our American soldiers went there.

587
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:15,399
And he's receiving this for his involvement in the invasion of Normandy, which we all know what happened in that particular invasion.

588
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:22,227
So with that being said, Mr. President, I would, it's a great honor to put this resolution on the agenda.

589
00:55:22,907 --> 00:55:32,756
Um, and hopefully, um, the city clerk can make contact with Mr. Massachusetts and try to find a date that might be reasonable and comfortable for him to come to receive this award.

590
00:55:33,837 --> 00:55:34,157
Thank you.

591
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:34,758
Counsel Penta.

592
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:43,145
I happened to be here in city hall the day he received the award from the consul general of France here, uh, serving in Boston.

593
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:54,308
And it's fortuitous that you should put this on the agenda this week, because this week marks the 70th anniversary of VE Day, Victory in Europe.

594
00:55:54,808 --> 00:56:07,438
It was 70 years ago that the Allied forces finally conquered evil in Europe, and people from Medford and all over the United States stepped up to the plate

595
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:15,070
Rich and poor alike, they came from every walk of life, very much unlike what we see today.

596
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:19,373
And it was just a remarkable thing.

597
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:32,103
And as that generation continues to make their way to their eternal reward, we can be particularly grateful of this Metphedite and so many others who have answered that call to service.

598
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:33,564
Councilor Knight.

599
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,303
Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Counselor Penta, for bringing this resolution forward.

600
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:48,808
I had the pleasure of growing up on the same street as Mr. Massaschusetts' daughter, and I became very close friends with his granddaughters, Colleen and Danielle.

601
00:56:49,349 --> 00:57:01,236
And over the years, I remember him coming to visit on the weekends and seeing his car, his long, black car, his Grand Marquis parked out in front of the house with the veterans' plates, and my father explaining to me what those veterans' plates mean.

602
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:08,649
And I can tell you this right now, the country of France has bestowed an award on a gentleman who is certainly deserving.

603
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,511
We affectionately called him Pa growing up in the neighborhood, Mr. President.

604
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:16,252
And I can't thank Counselor Penter enough for putting this resolution on.

605
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:20,993
I'm trying to withhold my smile on my face here this evening, because he's certainly a great guy.

606
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:25,115
He sacrificed a tremendous amount for his country, Mr. President.

607
00:57:26,062 --> 00:57:30,605
Anytime I've ever met the man, or dealt with the man, or saw the man, he always had a smile on his face, and he was always there.

608
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:32,166
A true family man, Mr. President.

609
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:36,669
So with that being said, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and thank Councilor Penta for putting it forward.

610
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,330
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

611
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,231
Thank you, Councilor Penta.

612
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:42,593
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

613
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:43,194
Aye.

614
00:57:43,374 --> 00:57:43,994
All those opposed?

615
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:45,035
Motion carries.

616
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:48,548
15-431 offered by Councillor Penta.

617
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:55,743
Be it resolved that Richard Cormier be congratulated with an official City Council citation on being nominated by the 2015

618
00:57:57,188 --> 00:58:01,949
American Ambulance Association to receive a Stars of Life Award.

619
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:09,431
Ricky, as he is known, is a Medford resident who works for Cataldo Ambulance as an EMT since 2007.

620
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:14,412
Ricky's nomination was due to his work in the field and in the dispatch center.

621
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:24,555
Ricky is being recognized for his intense concentration of making sure that his jobs are well executed and that his primary role is to ensure the care for those in need

622
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:26,336
at a time most urgent.

623
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:37,403
Ricky also utilizes his spare time as a city council cameraman who forwards council meetings to both Comcast and Verizon stations for cable casting.

624
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:38,764
Councilor Penta.

625
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:42,746
Mr. President, this isn't an award that's part of the triple play tonight.

626
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,668
This is an award that's not given out lightly.

627
00:58:46,248 --> 00:58:52,072
This is taken on a nationwide basis as it relates to people in this particular service, ambulatory service,

628
00:58:53,512 --> 00:58:54,753
for which they get involved in.

629
00:58:55,193 --> 00:59:02,818
He's recognized for his dedication, as we all know, for his ambulance service as a professional on the job and off the job.

630
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:15,405
And this is an honor that goes to an individual as part of a thank you from the American Automobile, I mean, American, excuse me, Ambulatory Association for the service that this gentleman has done as well.

631
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:21,929
And it also is to applaud individuals who set examples for people in their own profession.

632
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:27,820
It's a way for the outside world to understand what an ambulance driver, an EMT, was all about.

633
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:35,522
It goes to paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, customer service reps, and other operators, personnel are eligible for this nomination.

634
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:41,264
But he was single-handedly chosen out to receive this nomination for both his work in and off the field.

635
00:59:41,284 --> 00:59:43,885
And he's well respected.

636
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:44,925
He's experienced.

637
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:50,647
And he volunteers his time, as he has in the past, on weekends and late evenings.

638
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:53,887
for those individuals that he works with that just can't do it.

639
00:59:55,489 --> 01:00:05,637
I just think it would be nice to know that we have, once again, another employee here in the city, another resident of our city, who does our community proud.

640
01:00:05,697 --> 01:00:14,484
As a matter of fact, I believe in 2014, he was the representative of Cataldo Ambulance, who he's been with since 2007, I believe.

641
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:15,485
He is the 2014

642
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,343
representative in the Boston Marathon that he ran.

643
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:28,246
So I know he's a very shy individual.

644
01:00:30,988 --> 01:00:31,609
Well, no, no.

645
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:32,990
I want him to come out next week.

646
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:40,776
So Mr. Finkem have a per official citation for him and we can give it to him and maybe we can see him smile and that'll be very helpful.

647
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:45,119
Thank you.

648
01:00:45,139 --> 01:00:45,819
All those in favor.

649
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,881
Oh, council marks.

650
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:49,348
Thank you, Madam President.

651
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:52,609
I just want to echo my counselor's comments.

652
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:57,670
Over the last few years, I got to know Rich real well.

653
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,890
And you couldn't meet a more professional, kind, young gentleman.

654
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:08,771
And this is really an honor that's bestowed, as Counselor Penton mentioned, on very few.

655
01:01:09,372 --> 01:01:18,073
And to have such a recipient that actually walks among us, I think, is a great honor for this community, Madam President.

656
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:27,541
And I look forward to next week when he wears a tie and a suit coat and comes up to the podium and accepts his award, Madam President.

657
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:30,702
Great honor.

658
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:32,243
Counselor Penta.

659
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:42,466
I negated to say that this Stars of Life Award is a celebration that takes place between all the ambulatory companies throughout the country.

660
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,807
It's a national recognition.

661
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:51,954
So this isn't local, this isn't state, this is a national recognition, which even brings more honor and more distinction.

662
01:01:52,374 --> 01:02:11,050
And I don't think he could have no more too proud of parents than his mother and father, who are very proud of the situation, having a son such as Ricky bring them honor and a great show of, how can you say, encouragement to the city of Medford, letting people know that we do have so many good people

663
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,726
who receive so many honors for the work that they do that you just never hear about.

664
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:19,749
So with that being said, looking forward to seeing you, Ricky, next week sometime.

665
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:25,213
So on the motion of approved by Councilor Penter, all those in, oh, Councilor Knight.

666
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:27,514
Mr. President, thank you very much.

667
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:28,715
Ricky, congratulations.

668
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:31,317
I know you're in the camera closet watching.

669
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:34,840
I have a special request for Mr. Comia, Mr. President, and that's,

670
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:43,826
that when he appears before the council to accept his citation, that he wear his star of life around his neck here so he can show it off a little bit to the residents of Medford as well as the members of the council.

671
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:44,926
And his fancy uniform.

672
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:47,587
Congratulations.

673
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:49,969
So on the motion of approval by Council Penter, all those in favor?

674
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:51,189
All those opposed?

675
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:52,550
Motion passes.

676
01:02:58,012 --> 01:02:59,673
Petitions, presentations, and similar

677
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:18,134
015-432 offered by council Penta be resolved that the credit bridge information forwarded to the mayor on February 24th and having been a council topic for wanting the department of transportation to appear before the council for further explanations be addressed for immediate action.

678
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:18,935
Councilor Penta.

679
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:24,338
Mr. President, today I spoke to our city clerk as it relates to the letter that was sent.

680
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:30,022
Well, a copy was sent to you as well as other department heads as well as the mayor on February 24th.

681
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:45,990
At that meeting that we had subsequent to the 24th, I believe the city clerk made a phone call on the number that was addressed in the letter to secure information as to when they would come, or if they would come, let's put it that way.

682
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:53,975
And I believe in my conversation with the clerk today, he said he had not heard back, but he had made contact with them, and they were aware of what we were looking for.

683
01:03:54,676 --> 01:03:58,499
He made a phone call today, and he's waiting for them to get back to you.

684
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,320
Would that be reasonable enough to say?

685
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,864
The letter of information that was sent to us was on February 24th, and I don't know how much longer it's going to take, to be honest with you.

686
01:04:16,306 --> 01:04:19,268
The bids were solicited on February 18th of this year.

687
01:04:19,348 --> 01:04:24,192
Massachusetts Department of Transportation Highway Division is currently in the process of certifying the lowest bidder.

688
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:29,716
I don't know how long it takes from February 18th to March 18th to April 18th, almost up to May 18th.

689
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:34,485
Maybe government moves slow, but that's probably the slowest I've ever seen it.

690
01:04:35,465 --> 01:04:38,166
There's a whole host of questions and issues here, Mr. President.

691
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:41,547
As you said, you don't remember receiving this, and that's okay.

692
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:42,967
But our mayor did receive it.

693
01:04:44,107 --> 01:04:46,548
Our three state representatives did receive it.

694
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,509
Our acting building commissioner received it.

695
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,309
Our city engineer received it.

696
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:56,791
But the one person that didn't receive it was the Office of Community Development, who was a direct part in all of this.

697
01:04:56,871 --> 01:04:57,651
And I don't understand.

698
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:01,151
how that office was negated from being on here.

699
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:06,095
And I don't understand what the mayor's problem and not responding back as to what might be going on.

700
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:09,798
This Craddock Bridge is an integral part as to what's happening in Medford Square.

701
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:16,724
And the fact of the matter is that we've been talking about this thing, I think, dating back to 2007, if I think.

702
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:26,992
I think the very first resolution on the Craddock Bridge is owned by Councilor Lungo Kern going back to 2004 regarding the safety of the bridge on a question that was brought up.

703
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:30,003
And she then forwarded that to the council as part of a resolution.

704
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:33,545
And subsequent to that, it's been resolution after resolution and after resolution.

705
01:05:33,925 --> 01:05:42,829
And if this bridge was in such terrible disrepair, and if it was sinking and afraid to come apart and crumbling, we wouldn't even be talking about this right now, because it would be done.

706
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:47,131
We're not asking for a $13 million bridge that the state wants to put together.

707
01:05:47,571 --> 01:05:50,572
It's sitting on solid granite that's been there in excess of 100 years.

708
01:05:51,132 --> 01:05:54,894
We're just looking for a bridge that can handle traversing traffic.

709
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:55,394
That's all.

710
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,175
We're not looking for a state of the art,

711
01:05:57,612 --> 01:06:00,214
mausoleum type of a bridge that we can say, oh, wow.

712
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:11,283
And that's how the state gets itself in trouble, especially with spending its money without looking at the simple characteristic of putting a bridge, putting a roadway back together to let the cars go through.

713
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:17,128
And if the locks have a problem that need to be resolved, then address it as a separate issue or a joint issue at the same time.

714
01:06:17,628 --> 01:06:25,715
But to have this thing go out that started off as a $2.5 million, then it went up to $14 million, now it's back to $11 million, then it goes up to $12 million,

715
01:06:26,492 --> 01:06:34,214
Even they don't even know what's going on in the state, because we don't even know what the state is going to cost in real time when they begin to do it.

716
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:43,477
And then when they're talking about it's going to be done within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed, well, that's an awful lot of time, 1,300 calendar days.

717
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:49,239
And even if you split that in half, because they work double time or whatever it might be, that's over 650 days.

718
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:54,000
I mean, there's got to be an explanation that's better.

719
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,941
They could do fast 14.

720
01:06:56,425 --> 01:07:09,151
in 12 weekends during the course of a summer, then they could make a bridge that could be working for the Craddock Bridge, build it ahead of time, and come in maybe in a week's period of time or in a couple weeks to do it.

721
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:16,294
You know, I'm just disappointed in our city engineer not even responding back to us on this.

722
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:25,718
I'm also disappointed the Office of Community Development, knowing now that they were excluded from it, has not stuck their two cents in there to find out why were they excluded.

723
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,751
And deeply disappointed because the mayor, he doesn't respond to anything with us.

724
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:30,951
So that's a given.

725
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:35,732
This whole issue has been predicated on the council's involvement on this particular matter.

726
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,692
We're looking for mitigation.

727
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:43,273
We have absolutely no concern from anybody as it relates to this issue of mitigation.

728
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:54,075
If the mayor was the mayor, he'd be out there fighting tooth and nail that before this bid goes out, there'd be some form of mitigation for any sense of disruption that may takes place here in the city of Medford.

729
01:07:55,673 --> 01:08:01,995
I don't know where we're going, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this, and I'm not looking into a crystal ball, but maybe I am.

730
01:08:03,436 --> 01:08:23,883
If the mayor leaves before this term is over and you assume the position of mayor of this city, because that's what the charter says, then I would expect you to have a decision before this council immediately as to time, date, place, and mitigation of this bridge, because you've been just as much a part of this as anyone else has been.

731
01:08:24,324 --> 01:08:26,866
You've been aware of this just as much as anyone else has been.

732
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:34,573
And if you do the same thing that the guy in the corner office has done by not communicating, then the shame is going to be on you.

733
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,816
And I would hope that that does not rest on your shoulders, Mr. President.

734
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:44,442
Thank you very much for that kind admonition and vote of confidence, Councilor Penta.

735
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:50,428
May I take this opportunity to share with you an invitation offered to you by Paul Steadman,

736
01:08:51,127 --> 01:09:03,398
Acting District Highway Director, District 4, Arlington, 519 Appleton Street, to join a presentation tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

737
01:09:03,918 --> 01:09:16,429
to announce and introduce the contractor of this project and to have some minor details presented publicly on this project.

738
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:18,531
I've been in touch with Mr. Steadman

739
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:22,895
and have asked him to present to the council.

740
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:31,958
They're putting together a presentation with the contractor that will be given to the pertinent department heads in the city administration.

741
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:43,163
If I happen to be the administrator at that time, you can rest assured you'd be invited to that meeting and that they'd be before the city council too.

742
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:48,005
But as it is right now, I am not, nor do I foresee that happening.

743
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,564
But in any event, the invitation is open to you for tomorrow to be present at that unveiling.

744
01:09:54,684 --> 01:09:55,685
Can I ask you a question?

745
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:56,285
Yes, if you would.

746
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:58,447
Yes, the question is, when did you find out about this?

747
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,849
This, I think I found out about it yesterday.

748
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:08,655
Yesterday, and you're bringing it to the council tonight, and you expect me by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, for which I already have another engagement, to be there.

749
01:10:08,755 --> 01:10:11,057
I mean, why didn't Mr. Stedman just call the council?

750
01:10:11,077 --> 01:10:12,078
Why didn't he call the clerk?

751
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,258
He had been speaking to the clerk.

752
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,920
I don't have the answer to that.

753
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:22,070
But we are working on setting something up, and hopefully we'll have them here soon.

754
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:33,693
The President Well, I didn't make my comment facetiously about you becoming the mayor, because the word is out that the mayor is leaving before his term expires, whether it's rumor or what have you.

755
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:45,657
So I'm just telling you right up front, on any of these big issues, Mr. President, if, in fact, you do become the mayor of this community under the charter, I would hope a lot of these issues — a lot of these issues that are out there —

756
01:10:46,023 --> 01:10:47,984
you will address in a much better fashion than he.

757
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:49,305
Thank you.

758
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:52,868
Councillor Knight.

759
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:58,172
Actually, Councillor President, I wanted to share that same information that you shared with Councillor Penter.

760
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:03,676
I spoke with Mr. Steadman's office early last week and I too was extended an invitation to attend the meeting.

761
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:06,278
However, I too am unable to go tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the morning.

762
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:16,331
With that being said, I have had some conversations with a gentleman named Paul King, who also is heading up the project and working on the project to address some concerns that I have, Mr. President.

763
01:11:16,871 --> 01:11:18,612
But with that being said, that's just a side note.

764
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:21,453
I just wanted to be sure Councilor Pinto was aware that the meeting was going on tomorrow.

765
01:11:22,214 --> 01:11:23,034
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

766
01:11:23,074 --> 01:11:24,175
Councilor Caviello.

767
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:25,455
Could you repeat that information again?

768
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:26,736
Tomorrow morning.

769
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:27,256
10 o'clock.

770
01:11:27,276 --> 01:11:27,917
10 o'clock.

771
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:33,820
I think it's called District 4 in Arlington at number 519 Appleton Street.

772
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,360
I'm afraid I don't know.

773
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,361
It's right off of Cho.

774
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:38,746
Was that the building right off of route two by St.

775
01:11:38,846 --> 01:11:40,367
Kimball's church?

776
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:41,167
Yes.

777
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,029
Am I, am I invited to go or can I show up or?

778
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:48,310
You can go as my, you can go as my representative.

779
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:48,950
Okay.

780
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:54,233
Am I authorized to depute you as the council president as the representative of the Medford city council?

781
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:55,433
So I am allowed to go out.

782
01:11:55,453 --> 01:11:57,554
If I go, I won't be out of place, correct?

783
01:11:57,654 --> 01:11:58,054
Not at all.

784
01:11:58,294 --> 01:11:58,875
Thank you, Mr. President.

785
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:01,436
I don't think any person, even a citizen would be out of place.

786
01:12:01,456 --> 01:12:01,916
Not at all.

787
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:03,517
I think it's a public event.

788
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:03,937
Yeah.

789
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:08,240
So on motion of Council Penta for approval.

790
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,000
What's the approval of receiving place on file?

791
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,480
No, no, no, no.

792
01:12:12,721 --> 01:12:13,721
I want to keep this open.

793
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:14,881
I want to know where we're going with this.

794
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:19,682
So I'd like to lay this on the table until we find out further information on motion to table by Council Penta.

795
01:12:19,722 --> 01:12:20,422
All those in favor.

796
01:12:21,122 --> 01:12:21,783
All those opposed.

797
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:27,004
The matter is tabled petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

798
01:12:27,864 --> 01:12:32,665
15 dash four 33 petition by mystic cab company, four Oh seven rear mystic Avenue,

799
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:38,899
uh, suite, uh, 34 B to exchange the following two cabs license plates.

800
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:41,821
Do we need the, uh, petitioner present for this?

801
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:42,461
I think so.

802
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:43,362
Is he here?

803
01:12:45,303 --> 01:12:46,304
Is Mr. Cab here?

804
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:51,427
Uh, Mr. President, I'll request that this will be tabled until he shows up.

805
01:12:51,927 --> 01:12:56,730
On the motion of Councilor Caviello to table the matter, uh, until the petitioner shows up.

806
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,491
All those in favor.

807
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:58,512
All those opposed.

808
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:00,613
The motion is tabled.

809
01:13:01,853 --> 01:13:09,299
15-434, petition by Mr. Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, to discuss Media Center.

810
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,522
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

811
01:13:12,782 --> 01:13:13,203
Good evening.

812
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:14,924
Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield.

813
01:13:15,204 --> 01:13:20,208
Three years ago, I came up to the city council when the mayor was looking for a new cable advisory committee.

814
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:24,432
And it was March of 2011, and I discussed bringing it to the Chevalier Theater.

815
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:30,637
Now, through the great work of Fred Lasky and even Father Chip Hines, we actually went to the Chevalier Theater.

816
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,753
There is a room up on the second floor.

817
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:39,135
The room could house equipment that we could purchase or equipment that we already own.

818
01:13:39,476 --> 01:13:43,877
But a very key thing here, last week we found out that there's no air conditioner at the Chevalier.

819
01:13:44,398 --> 01:13:48,840
What a wonderful synergy to bring some of the money that we have for public access.

820
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:59,004
And if the public access is at the Chevalier, we can either loan them the money, one city entity loaning another city entity the money for air conditioning system, and have shows all summer.

821
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:01,073
This is so important, it's vital.

822
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:12,998
The idea of Springstep that these gentlemen brought up, if you had Springstep and you had the TV station at the Chevalier, or even that beautiful, some of the people here were at the DPW this Sunday.

823
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:15,159
What a magnificent building.

824
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,400
Now there's room in there to put a radio station, a TV station.

825
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,702
I could build these things for this city within less than a week.

826
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:25,003
Give me three days, we'd have stuff up and running.

827
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:30,350
It's essential that we look at what we have in Medford and what we're not doing with it.

828
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,551
We are not doing anything with the Chevalier Theater.

829
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:33,331
Nothing.

830
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:38,453
It just needs to be revitalized in an action way.

831
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:39,953
It's a beautiful building.

832
01:14:39,973 --> 01:14:41,954
It doesn't have to be revitalized in that way.

833
01:14:42,374 --> 01:14:43,514
It needs an air conditioner.

834
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:45,855
The public access money is sitting there.

835
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:53,197
And if indeed the council president becomes the mayor, I submit to him tonight that this would be a very wise decision.

836
01:14:53,217 --> 01:14:54,978
It would do much for him and this community

837
01:14:55,618 --> 01:15:00,460
to bring an air conditioner to the Chevalier, hopefully bring the TV station to the Chevalier.

838
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,481
We have 181 days left to November 3rd.

839
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:11,924
Without this TV station, we were promised, every politician in Medford, every elected official is at a disadvantage.

840
01:15:12,604 --> 01:15:14,424
Come August 1st, it'll be 94 days.

841
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:17,205
Come October 1st, it'll be 33 days.

842
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:24,668
And will we have an access TV station for each candidate to go up there and give their platform to inform the citizens of Medford?

843
01:15:25,243 --> 01:15:27,124
I will help this community build a station.

844
01:15:27,885 --> 01:15:29,866
My first choice is the Chevalier Theatre.

845
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:35,029
I hope that the City Council will work with me so that we can achieve this in the next two weeks.

846
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,830
Thank you.

847
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:37,811
Thank you.

848
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:40,873
Councillor Penta.

849
01:15:41,514 --> 01:15:42,214
No letter, Speaker.

850
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:44,976
Madam Citizen.

851
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:45,715
Thank you.

852
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:46,975
Gene Martington, Cumming Street.

853
01:15:47,015 --> 01:16:00,498
I'd just like to, now that we have a new mayor, or we're gonna have a new mayor, we don't necessarily have to take the half a loaf of bread that we were gonna take and put the station up at the Volk.

854
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:14,160
It's not a bad idea to put it up at the Volk, but if it is gonna be a community station, then putting it in a centralized location in Medford Square might be something we need to think about, because it could revitalize, be part of the machine that revitalizes the square.

855
01:16:14,762 --> 01:16:28,733
The other thing is that there is supposed to be a high school station because 3% goes to the city, 1% goes to access, and the other half or something like that is supposed to provide.

856
01:16:29,574 --> 01:16:32,236
50%, 50-50, 50 for police and fire, 50 for education.

857
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:36,219
Yeah, so they're supposed to already get money to put up a station anyway.

858
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:36,940
Not a station.

859
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:38,455
Oh, not a station.

860
01:16:38,675 --> 01:16:39,396
Oh, I take that back.

861
01:16:39,876 --> 01:16:46,041
So, but it might be, I'm not, I'm not suggesting that we have to do it one way or the other, but it's something to rethink about.

862
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:46,822
Thank you.

863
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:48,904
Mr. President.

864
01:16:50,045 --> 01:16:50,225
Ms.

865
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:51,666
Martin, uh, councilor Pinto.

866
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:57,311
I think what Mr. Vigliano presents is a reasonable proposal.

867
01:16:57,751 --> 01:17:05,318
Also, what I heard tonight was kind of like reasonable as well, too, when they talked about the library and I think councilor Caviello was probably on mark with that.

868
01:17:05,803 --> 01:17:08,685
There are two pretty central locations here in the city of Medford.

869
01:17:09,426 --> 01:17:23,276
The one interesting part about the library, if I remember correctly, this is history, and going back, I believe the building can withstand the addition of a top floor to the building, or there's a section in the building that you could go up and add another section to it.

870
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:34,805
But the availability of Shavire Auditorium being right there and satelliting with another location for the purposes of transmission and studios and everything else like that,

871
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:36,960
It presents a great idea.

872
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:37,840
And I like the idea.

873
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,800
I never even thought of it.

874
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,261
I shouldn't have thought of it.

875
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:42,301
I wasn't even thinking of the air conditioning.

876
01:17:43,261 --> 01:17:47,203
One agency or one division can loan the other people to a division to get the money for whatever it might be.

877
01:17:48,423 --> 01:17:52,064
Representative Donato has been very successful in Beacon Hill in getting money for the chairs.

878
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:58,786
And maybe he can get some success in getting money for the air conditioning for the building or for a partial air conditioning for the building.

879
01:17:59,446 --> 01:18:01,427
But the sad part to all of this whole story

880
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:09,092
It's going to take place tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, because we have what they call an ascertainment hearing at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

881
01:18:10,813 --> 01:18:12,073
Excuse me, Thursday afternoon.

882
01:18:12,133 --> 01:18:14,033
Excuse me, Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock.

883
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:21,395
And the sad part about having this ascertainment hearing on Thursday at 2 o'clock is the contract with Comcast has already come to an end.

884
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:25,376
So technically, we're actually working with them as a tenant at will.

885
01:18:25,416 --> 01:18:31,097
This ascertainment hearing should have taken place at minimum six months to a year prior to the contract closing.

886
01:18:31,715 --> 01:18:35,957
So what's going to be accomplished at this hearing is not going to make any sense at all.

887
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:57,889
But the only sense that it will make is for people to come and tell them why you don't like what you're getting, whether the folks at Comcast are rude or they're not rude, whether the fees are too high, whether the channels should be a la carte or individual, or whether the programming should have a whole different type of an appetite, and to show what comparisons might be between Verizon and Comcast.

888
01:18:57,949 --> 01:18:59,970
As a matter of fact, Comcast has been voted

889
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:08,435
the worst corporation in the country for customer services on the national agenda.

890
01:19:09,356 --> 01:19:26,292
And our mayor was one of 52 who wrote letters to the Federal Trade Commission for the purposes of allowing Comcast to be bought into this merger with Time Warner, thankfully that they did not allow because they felt that the corporate conglomerate would just destroy this whole idea.

891
01:19:26,705 --> 01:19:32,990
not only of public access, but for televising, what do you call it, bandwidth and broadband.

892
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:39,715
So these are all technical things that are beyond my imagination for understanding, but all I know is having an understanding.

893
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:50,643
But when they turn around and put a picture of our present mayor on a story with other mayors saying that he was a shill for Comcast, and he was a shill, and they went down to explain

894
01:19:51,170 --> 01:20:00,840
that the reason is because on an annual basis, got $10,000 a year for a celebration committee, got $2,500 each and every year for his golf tournament.

895
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:06,426
And when you start thinking about that and you hear people talk about it, they're saying, wait a minute, we're not paying.

896
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:09,829
I'm not paying my cable bill so he can have a golf tournament every year.

897
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:13,393
I'm not paying my cable bill so he can have a celebration committee.

898
01:20:13,887 --> 01:20:17,149
And that's a cost that's built right in to everyone's cable fee.

899
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:18,689
Comcast isn't giving this for nothing.

900
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:26,953
They know what the cost is to give out those perks to those 52 mayors who signed on and were termed shills for Comcast.

901
01:20:27,393 --> 01:20:35,997
That's a hell of a way to go out of office, being known that you were shill, leaving the city all upside down with these crazy meters in the square, and God knows what else is going to happen.

902
01:20:36,677 --> 01:20:37,858
The fact of the matter is,

903
01:20:38,164 --> 01:20:44,749
We have a terrible contract here with Comcast, and nothing should be signed until a new mayor comes on board.

904
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:48,912
So if we have to stay on as nothing more than a tenant, so be it.

905
01:20:49,413 --> 01:20:59,681
I'm going to ask that this council make a request that the mayor does not sign any new 10-year contract with Comcast and until a new administration comes on board.

906
01:21:00,221 --> 01:21:01,042
Isn't it interesting?

907
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:05,087
They took the same thing when they were trying to hire a new public works director.

908
01:21:05,367 --> 01:21:07,710
They went through the whole process, and then they decided to stop.

909
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,151
Let the new mayor come in.

910
01:21:09,371 --> 01:21:10,852
Let the new mayor hire that person.

911
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:13,635
Well, we have enough 10-year contracts to deal with.

912
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:20,401
We have a rubbish contract that I believe was in its seventh year, and it was re-upped for another 10 years when they renewed it.

913
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:25,025
We have a stupid kiosk program that's a 10-year contract.

914
01:21:25,405 --> 01:21:27,767
And we have a contract right now that's not in operation,

915
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:31,866
which is the tail end of a Comcast contract, which is all over, it's expired.

916
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:36,349
So if we have to sit around and being tenants at will, so be it, so to speak.

917
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:49,800
But I don't think the mayor should do anything, anything, to indulge this community into another 10-year contract without having a say, and especially not having a public hearing in advance before any contract negotiation took place.

918
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:56,165
So I move that resolution, Mr. President, that the Memphis City Council go on record and respectfully request the mayor

919
01:21:56,712 --> 01:22:00,553
not to engage and not to sign any contract with Comcast.

920
01:22:01,693 --> 01:22:05,395
Until there's a new mayor.

921
01:22:05,615 --> 01:22:06,715
Until a new mayor is sworn in.

922
01:22:07,735 --> 01:22:09,416
On that motion, Councilor Knight.

923
01:22:10,536 --> 01:22:23,340
Mr. President, I believe we did pass a resolution on 324.15, as I look at my resolution tracking sheet, paper number 15306, asking the mayor do not sign a 10-year Comcast contract.

924
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:27,994
I'm not sure how this paper would differ from the paper that was previously passed.

925
01:22:28,054 --> 01:22:29,555
Is it so that he doesn't sign any contract?

926
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:31,476
He doesn't negotiate into any contract at all?

927
01:22:32,476 --> 01:22:35,698
You know, I question the body's ability to take away powers of the executive.

928
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:36,798
There's a separation of powers.

929
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,039
The executive has certain powers in the community.

930
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:40,840
We can make recommendations all we want.

931
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,560
I think we've done that.

932
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,002
I think we've expressed to him that we want a member on the negotiating committee, a member of this committee on the negotiating committee.

933
01:22:46,803 --> 01:22:49,484
I think that was part of the resolution, paper 15306.

934
01:22:49,824 --> 01:22:54,546
So I guess my question is, how does this paper differ from the paper that was passed previously?

935
01:22:55,035 --> 01:22:58,858
The difference between this paper and that one, we now are dealing with a contract that's expired.

936
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:05,662
Number one, we're dealing with the national attainment hearing that's taking place this Thursday that should have come before the fact, and it's now coming after the fact.

937
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:17,269
What the mayor intends to accomplish by doing this, and it was this council that voted 7 to 11 to have that hearing take place at 6, 630 at night to allow taxpayers who couldn't have an opportunity to come at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

938
01:23:17,589 --> 01:23:20,411
We're now dealing with a contract that's already been—that's expired.

939
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:23,213
You are talking about a contract that was still in operation.

940
01:23:23,613 --> 01:23:24,714
Now, with no contract,

941
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:33,582
and having no direction from the mayor, this is a respectful request that he does not sign any contract with Comcast until on and after a new mayor has been sworn in.

942
01:23:35,423 --> 01:23:43,327
Mr. President, I don't see how this paper is really much different than the last one that was filed then, and I question the council's ability to actually take a power away from the executive branch.

943
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:47,090
You know, I certainly think that a 10-year contract is bad.

944
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:47,830
I certainly think that

945
01:23:48,217 --> 01:24:05,422
in the future as we start negotiating these municipal contracts, that a member of the council should be included in the participation in the discussions, Mr. President, for the simple fact that we can avoid situations like this, where we have a conflicted council, a council that's in blatant disagreement with the length of the term of the contract, and an administration that doesn't feel as though that's quite the case.

946
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:07,783
They think a tenure contract might be in the best interest of the community.

947
01:24:08,623 --> 01:24:16,226
With that being said, Mr. President, you know, do we have the authority to tell the man that he doesn't have the right to perform the essential functions of his job before he leaves?

948
01:24:16,606 --> 01:24:17,166
I don't think we do.

949
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,470
Well, point of further information, Mr. President.

950
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,791
Point of further information, Council Penta.

951
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:27,212
Council Knight just included a resolve that was passed earlier this year, which I'm assuming he voted for.

952
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,572
And now he's trying to say, what right do we have to interfere?

953
01:24:29,992 --> 01:24:37,153
Well, the mayor has already acknowledged it by noting that he's not going to hire a new Department of Public Works director at $120,000 plus a year.

954
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:38,434
And he's letting that go.

955
01:24:38,654 --> 01:24:43,215
He's already set the channels in one particular direction on an appointment.

956
01:24:43,735 --> 01:24:46,035
Did the council receive a paper to that effect?

957
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:46,574
Pardon me?

958
01:24:46,694 --> 01:24:48,235
Did the Council receive a paper to that?

959
01:24:48,315 --> 01:24:53,099
I think if you speak to the, um, um, um, what's her name downstairs?

960
01:24:53,739 --> 01:24:54,440
I can't think of her name.

961
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,380
Mrs. Miller.

962
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,862
She'll tell you that that's what the city has done.

963
01:24:59,483 --> 01:25:01,665
Councilor Knight.

964
01:25:02,518 --> 01:25:08,602
Again, Mr. President, if it were up to me, they'd fill the DPW director's job yesterday so we can start getting these broken roads repaired.

965
01:25:09,582 --> 01:25:11,924
We can start looking at doing a major overhaul of our streets.

966
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:16,806
We can start looking at whether or not a citywide resurfacing plan is necessary and required, which we all know it is.

967
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:21,689
We can start digging up our emergency arteries, and we can start actually moving Medford forward, Mr. President.

968
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:23,370
So with that being said,

969
01:25:23,692 --> 01:25:28,434
You know, I just question whether or not, you know, this resolution's going to meet its purpose.

970
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,775
I question whether or not we actually have the right to take the powers away from the executive.

971
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:37,137
You know, we can ask that the mayor not do it, but to demand it or to require it, I don't think is within our scope.

972
01:25:37,357 --> 01:25:39,598
I think if you heard my question, it was respectfully request.

973
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:40,658
That was the term.

974
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:41,519
Very good.

975
01:25:42,199 --> 01:25:43,439
Would the clerk please read back the language?

976
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:46,100
I do have a respectful request.

977
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,741
Yeah, can you read the question?

978
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:56,565
Move the question.

979
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:58,927
Questions moved.

980
01:25:58,947 --> 01:26:00,128
Two Councillors wish to speak.

981
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:00,928
Councillor Marks.

982
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:02,469
You're all set, Councillor Knight.

983
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:02,969
Yes.

984
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:03,770
Councillor Marks.

985
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,671
Thank you, Mr. President.

986
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:12,796
And I, for one, and I don't think my other colleagues are saying that we're going to try to circumvent the mayor's powers.

987
01:26:12,856 --> 01:26:17,178
We know under the city charter, he has the authority to sign contracts.

988
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:24,603
I think what we're saying is common sense should prevail that the mayor is going to be leaving in several months.

989
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:32,325
And I don't think anyone should have the ability to strap their predecessor in for a 10-year contract.

990
01:26:33,025 --> 01:26:36,266
And, you know, that's where I stand on the issue.

991
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:43,809
Regarding the ascertainment hearing, Councilor Penta has been bringing this up week after week, along with other citizens.

992
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:49,170
But we did vote to move this to 6 p.m., which the mayor denied.

993
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:54,212
So, residents in the community, people that have a full-time job and can't make a

994
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,827
two in the afternoon meeting here at City Hall would be able to attend.

995
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:01,290
There's two points that I wanted to bring up.

996
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:09,997
The first one is the connectivity that we've been talking about before this council for, it's gotta be at least 10 years now, on Riverside Avenue Square.

997
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:14,540
There's a number of businesses on there that can't get internet access.

998
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,142
Why is that?

999
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:22,967
In this day and age, why do you have a section of your downtown business district that doesn't have access to the internet?

1000
01:27:23,347 --> 01:27:24,508
It just boggles my mind.

1001
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:36,181
That would be the first thing that, if I was signing the contract, that I would make sure whatever hurdles they have to jump over, that they're going to jump over to make sure everyone has access in that particular square.

1002
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:47,969
It was also brought to my attention just recently, Mr. President, and I was unaware of this, but apparently Comcast offers a number of different services in addition to cable.

1003
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:51,471
They offer security and fire alarm systems also.

1004
01:27:52,212 --> 01:27:53,693
And it was brought to my attention

1005
01:27:54,460 --> 01:28:04,865
as they refer to the life safety systems, that Massachusetts has a lot of rules and regulations that govern the life safety systems.

1006
01:28:05,585 --> 01:28:06,526
And the rules are clear.

1007
01:28:06,546 --> 01:28:11,888
In Massachusetts, all life safety system companies and their technicians must be licensed.

1008
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:17,771
Every system they install must be inspected for code compliance by local authorities.

1009
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:20,952
Earning a license takes years of education and training.

1010
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:27,602
Maintaining a license requires continuing education to keep up with the latest technologies and building codes.

1011
01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:40,327
Furthermore, every employee of the security system company in Massachusetts has to pass a CORI criminal background check and obtain a state public safety certification of clearance every two years.

1012
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:43,929
Comcast has disregarded these laws, Mr. President.

1013
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:49,691
Apparently, there is a legal battle going on right now, but needless to say,

1014
01:28:50,293 --> 01:28:58,876
This should be a question that should be asked by whoever's signing the contract, and in our case, it's the mayor, on behalf of the residents.

1015
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:11,341
If I'm a resident and I'm just looking through trying to get someone to provide a security system or a fire alarm in my house, I just look through and possibly, because I'm already doing business with Comcast, I would select them.

1016
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,983
I would not be aware that they don't cover

1017
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:26,808
the proper licenses, that their employees aren't checked with the CORI, criminal background check, and a host of other issues that are brought up, Mr. President.

1018
01:29:27,288 --> 01:29:44,395
And I think it's only appropriate that that be one of the questions, the connectivity issue and the question regarding their life safety systems, why they don't comply to state statute, which requires their workers to be CORI checked

1019
01:29:44,802 --> 01:29:48,384
and also to maintain compliance with local authorities.

1020
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:53,506
And I would ask that that be part of the hearing on Thursday.

1021
01:29:54,046 --> 01:29:56,467
I, like other members of the council, I'm not sure if I can get there.

1022
01:29:56,547 --> 01:29:57,267
I work in town.

1023
01:29:57,728 --> 01:30:02,130
Two o'clock in the afternoon, that's why we asked to change it to six.

1024
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:03,230
It's difficult.

1025
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,971
And this is a very important issue.

1026
01:30:05,391 --> 01:30:09,773
This impacts everyone in the community, whether you have Comcast or Verizon.

1027
01:30:10,273 --> 01:30:13,835
Every person in the community is paying these high rates, Mr. President.

1028
01:30:14,798 --> 01:30:19,499
And as was mentioned by, I think it was Councilor Penta, the service you receive is lackluster.

1029
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:24,881
And honestly, you know, they corner the market in this system.

1030
01:30:25,641 --> 01:30:31,182
You can get a disc on your house, one of those dishes, if you don't mind your house looking like a satellite.

1031
01:30:32,543 --> 01:30:41,145
I offered an ordinance back, I think it's got to be four years now, to regulate, maybe five years, to regulate the disc on the homes.

1032
01:30:41,665 --> 01:30:44,246
And to regulate the disc don't go on the front of the homes.

1033
01:30:45,784 --> 01:30:50,307
And when discs are no longer used, like my neighbor across the street has three of them on the front of the home.

1034
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:51,648
It's a rental property.

1035
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:53,870
They no longer, they have Comcast now.

1036
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:58,473
They no longer use the dishes, but you still have the wires that are running to these dishes.

1037
01:30:59,474 --> 01:31:00,775
It's just an eyesore.

1038
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:04,398
There's no regulations on it as far as I know.

1039
01:31:05,018 --> 01:31:09,882
And I think it's only appropriate that these are the questions that we should be asking in this community.

1040
01:31:10,622 --> 01:31:12,964
The dish is a different thing than Comcast.

1041
01:31:13,562 --> 01:31:18,886
I would ask that those be introduced, uh, Mr. President, uh, at the ascertainment hearing on Thursday.

1042
01:31:19,427 --> 01:31:24,311
So on the motion of council Penta amended by council marks council care of yellow.

1043
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:25,331
Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:31:25,892 --> 01:31:35,239
Um, I don't recall, but I remember that we asked the solicitor for an opinion, um, on whether the mayor has the ability to resign another 10 year contract.

1045
01:31:35,259 --> 01:31:38,482
I don't recall us getting an opinion back from the city solicitor on that.

1046
01:31:40,523 --> 01:31:42,325
Somehow under the opinion that we did.

1047
01:31:42,889 --> 01:31:44,169
But I may be mistaken.

1048
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:45,810
I don't recall seeing them, Mr. President.

1049
01:31:49,351 --> 01:32:00,054
On the kiosk, but I think we asked if that 10-year contract needed us to give him the okay, or was it a grandfather thing, did he get to keep on doing it?

1050
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:03,535
And I don't recall getting that opinion back from the solicitor.

1051
01:32:09,249 --> 01:32:11,070
Point of clarification, Councillor Pinto.

1052
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:20,878
The idea of having the ascertainment hearing, if it was done ahead of time, would have presented the fact that, under the way the city of Methods has been operating, the issuing authority has been the mayor.

1053
01:32:21,258 --> 01:32:30,586
But if the ascertainment hearing showed enough interest that the issuing authority be the legislative body, the council, OK, that would be the time for the purposes of the renegotiation.

1054
01:32:30,886 --> 01:32:36,930
That's the whole idea of having that type of a hearing well in advance, not after the fact, because the cat's already out of the bag.

1055
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:38,692
I for one was planning on attending,

1056
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:42,668
conflicts with another meeting I have up at the state.

1057
01:32:42,748 --> 01:32:46,249
I just think it's unfair because we had asked respectfully that the meeting take place at night.

1058
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:51,392
So residents who had a complaint could, or even a compliment could have come and had an opportunity to speak.

1059
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:53,273
But now who's going to come at two in the afternoon?

1060
01:32:56,314 --> 01:32:57,655
Councilor Cavill, you're all set.

1061
01:32:57,915 --> 01:32:58,615
I'm all set Mr. President.

1062
01:32:59,336 --> 01:33:00,096
Councilor Marks.

1063
01:33:00,256 --> 01:33:08,480
Just briefly, I think the issue was when the mayor's parking plan was presented to us, we were told by state statute, anything over three years,

1064
01:33:09,108 --> 01:33:13,851
required a vote of the council that allowed the mayor to enter into a contract over three years.

1065
01:33:14,412 --> 01:33:19,515
Now, this is a renewal of a contract, as the clerk just said, that's been around for 30-something years.

1066
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:27,541
I think the question that we posed to the city solicitor was, does a renewal of a contract have any difference under the eyes of the state statute?

1067
01:33:28,321 --> 01:33:32,464
I'm not sure what the answer is, and I thought that's what we asked the city solicitor.

1068
01:33:32,484 --> 01:33:33,264
The question is different.

1069
01:33:33,284 --> 01:33:38,268
We're not in a renewal process because we're not renewing

1070
01:33:40,284 --> 01:33:42,205
We're not renewing something before the deadline.

1071
01:33:42,245 --> 01:33:45,486
The deadline has now come and gone, so there is no contract.

1072
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:46,747
There is no renewal.

1073
01:33:47,147 --> 01:33:49,128
This is like writing a brand new contract.

1074
01:33:49,488 --> 01:33:50,948
There's no grace period in here.

1075
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:57,131
May I suggest that we amend this to request a clarification from the city solicitor?

1076
01:33:58,391 --> 01:33:58,911
Councilor Knight?

1077
01:33:59,812 --> 01:34:05,054
In looking through my records here, Mr. President, I see paper 15-306, the paper that I referred to earlier.

1078
01:34:06,034 --> 01:34:08,595
As we deliberated, I believe this was the meeting where we may have

1079
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,120
taking a recess?

1080
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,261
No, that was in the kiosk, actually.

1081
01:34:11,281 --> 01:34:11,941
We didn't take a recess.

1082
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:13,162
But we did craft some language here.

1083
01:34:13,562 --> 01:34:20,525
And in looking at the language that we have here, it says, be it resolved that the mayor not enter into a contract or any other agreement until the public hearing is conducted.

1084
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,385
That was the language.

1085
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,046
That was the language that we approved.

1086
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:25,227
The public hearing will be conducted on Thursday.

1087
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:33,571
I personally have no problem supporting a resolution requesting that the mayor not enter into any contract that's 10 years in length after the hearing is conducted.

1088
01:34:33,591 --> 01:34:38,393
You know, and I still do have, I think Councilor Caviello raises a good concern as to whether or not that 10-year

1089
01:34:39,527 --> 01:34:41,148
still remains in effect.

1090
01:34:41,248 --> 01:34:51,836
So, you know, with that being said, Mr. President, after going through the meeting minutes here, um, you know, it clearly said that the council voted to, um, you know, recommend that the mayor not sign any contract until the hearing is conducted.

1091
01:34:51,877 --> 01:34:53,478
The hearing going to be conducted this week.

1092
01:34:53,818 --> 01:34:57,721
Thereafter, we're going to have to be in a situation where he's either going to sign a contract or he's not.

1093
01:34:57,741 --> 01:35:00,203
And the council is not going to be on record advising him one way or the other.

1094
01:35:00,603 --> 01:35:03,205
Um, with that being said, you know, councilor Penter, I stand corrected.

1095
01:35:03,225 --> 01:35:05,427
I took a look at the minutes in the old resolution that was in there.

1096
01:35:05,952 --> 01:35:12,075
And in my review of it, it clearly says that until a public hearing is conducted, the council is recommended that the man on enter into the contract.

1097
01:35:12,495 --> 01:35:15,316
So with that being said, the difference would be the hearing is going to take place.

1098
01:35:16,437 --> 01:35:19,158
When the hearing takes place, the council hasn't recommended any action thereafter.

1099
01:35:19,538 --> 01:35:27,622
So with that being said, Mr. President, um, I certainly wouldn't have a problem supporting this resolution as, um, recited by the clerk.

1100
01:35:28,062 --> 01:35:28,582
Very good.

1101
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:32,764
So on the motion of counselor Penta as amended by counselors marks,

1102
01:35:33,385 --> 01:35:55,164
And council Caviello requesting the city solicitor report back to us on the propriety of this by the next meeting on the propriety of the action of the 10 year contract as opposed to the three year contract.

1103
01:35:55,204 --> 01:35:57,146
No, I'm not talking about three and that's not my resolution.

1104
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,188
I'm saying if they granted,

1105
01:36:00,279 --> 01:36:04,002
You need to know if they had granted this prior before.

1106
01:36:04,062 --> 01:36:12,889
I get a word, so it's such that you, that does the mayor now have the authority to entertain, go into a 10-year agreement?

1107
01:36:12,929 --> 01:36:15,171
No, I think the contract is simple.

1108
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:18,614
If the contract has already expired as of April 20th, there is no contract.

1109
01:36:18,854 --> 01:36:20,315
Yeah, but either way, it doesn't matter.

1110
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:24,438
It's still the 10-year that you're concerned with no more than anyways.

1111
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:45,339
can you just read read the resolution before you get to the amendments and then we'll just take them when I'm you're getting me confused with all these what's the resolution say started off the main opinion from the city solicitor on their

1112
01:36:45,955 --> 01:36:48,697
If he can enter a 10-year agreement.

1113
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:50,319
That would be a separate resolution.

1114
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:51,860
That was an amendment.

1115
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,982
That's the amendment, it's not the resolution.

1116
01:36:54,082 --> 01:36:56,363
Can you read the resolution before it's amended?

1117
01:36:57,424 --> 01:36:59,506
That the mayor respectfully request the mayor.

1118
01:36:59,906 --> 01:37:00,947
That's an amendment.

1119
01:37:01,267 --> 01:37:03,309
No, that's the resolution.

1120
01:37:03,529 --> 01:37:04,550
The main resolution.

1121
01:37:07,773 --> 01:37:09,154
There was a petition to speak.

1122
01:37:09,174 --> 01:37:10,595
That's your amendment to his petition.

1123
01:37:10,865 --> 01:37:11,045
No.

1124
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:28,675
So, so the amendment then comes from councilor, uh, so that the motion then was crafted by councilor Penta that the mayor respectfully request the mayor respectfully request the city council requests respectfully request that the mayor is right.

1125
01:37:29,296 --> 01:37:30,957
And then it's amended with the following.

1126
01:37:32,538 --> 01:37:32,798
Okay.

1127
01:37:33,138 --> 01:37:33,858
Roll call.

1128
01:37:34,059 --> 01:37:39,722
Has one on the, uh, home security scoring check program.

1129
01:37:41,335 --> 01:37:42,176
and the connectivity.

1130
01:37:45,598 --> 01:37:49,121
So on that motion, Mr. Citizen.

1131
01:37:49,821 --> 01:37:50,441
Thank you very much.

1132
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:57,166
Just very briefly, I would ask that every councilor that can't make the hearing, please write a letter.

1133
01:37:57,206 --> 01:38:07,813
So if Councilor Marks could write a letter through the chair to Comcast and explain to them his concerns, especially about the, I didn't know that about when they install those systems, that's very important.

1134
01:38:08,228 --> 01:38:11,509
The other second point is I was in Haines Square today going business to business.

1135
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:13,770
No one knew about the ascertainment hearing.

1136
01:38:14,591 --> 01:38:15,411
They were outraged.

1137
01:38:15,551 --> 01:38:19,773
One woman was wanting to be there and said, you know, two o'clock, I can't do it.

1138
01:38:20,313 --> 01:38:23,074
So, and one business told me that he's going with T-Mobile.

1139
01:38:23,174 --> 01:38:24,155
He's got a great deal.

1140
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:27,756
And as Councilor Penta brought up the new technologies, there you go.

1141
01:38:28,217 --> 01:38:29,537
So, no one's been alerted.

1142
01:38:29,957 --> 01:38:34,339
I would say the mayor should really hold off for another two weeks, have it at 630 at night.

1143
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,161
The citizens don't know about this.

1144
01:38:37,781 --> 01:38:38,061
Thank you.

1145
01:38:39,362 --> 01:38:41,023
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1146
01:38:42,024 --> 01:38:43,604
Roll call vote has been requested.

1147
01:38:43,745 --> 01:38:45,085
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1148
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:51,149
Councilor Camuso?

1149
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:52,730
Councilor Caviello?

1150
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,870
Yes.

1151
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,030
Councilor Night?

1152
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:54,911
Yes.

1153
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:56,152
Vice President Lowell-Kern?

1154
01:38:56,192 --> 01:38:56,252
Yes.

1155
01:38:56,872 --> 01:38:57,452
Councilor Marx?

1156
01:38:57,793 --> 01:38:58,013
Yes.

1157
01:38:58,393 --> 01:38:58,993
Councilor Patu?

1158
01:38:59,233 --> 01:38:59,334
Yes.

1159
01:38:59,834 --> 01:39:00,614
President De La Russo?

1160
01:39:00,674 --> 01:39:00,974
Yes.

1161
01:39:01,295 --> 01:39:03,616
On the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

1162
01:39:04,016 --> 01:39:04,997
The motion carries.

1163
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:13,561
Now that we've finished the regular part of the agenda, we're gonna take papers in the hand of the city clerk.

1164
01:39:14,601 --> 01:39:16,181
We have two here that are related.

1165
01:39:16,402 --> 01:39:20,502
One offered by Councilors Knight, Camuso, and Caraviello.

1166
01:39:21,022 --> 01:39:23,383
The other offered by myself, President De La Russo.

1167
01:39:24,063 --> 01:39:34,305
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer its deep and sincere condolences to the family of a longtime Medford High School athletic director, Jack Regan, on his recent passing.

1168
01:39:34,725 --> 01:39:36,105
Mr. Regan was a phys ed teacher

1169
01:39:36,544 --> 01:39:41,168
athletic director of Medford High, great football player, and veteran of the Korean War.

1170
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:42,909
Counselor Knight.

1171
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:46,312
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1172
01:39:47,073 --> 01:39:59,684
My father, having served as an educator in the city of Somerville for nearly 40 years, and the athletic director at Somerville High School for about 20 of those years, developed a strong relationship with Jack Regan when he was here at the city of Medford.

1173
01:40:00,424 --> 01:40:04,808
Through that relationship, I too became friendly with Jack, and I really enjoyed the time that I got to spend with him.

1174
01:40:05,442 --> 01:40:11,767
He was a mentor, he was a strict disciplinarian, and he was also an all-around great guy, Mr. President.

1175
01:40:11,867 --> 01:40:13,008
And he will be sadly missed.

1176
01:40:13,368 --> 01:40:20,913
After his retirement, I had the opportunity and pleasure to see him socially, as opposed to in the military setting of Meffitt High School.

1177
01:40:21,734 --> 01:40:26,017
And in these dealings with him, I found him to be a well-rounded, down-to-earth gentleman.

1178
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,332
who will be sadly missed.

1179
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:28,594
He raised a beautiful family.

1180
01:40:29,115 --> 01:40:31,879
He has a beautiful, he leaves a beautiful bride, Mr. President.

1181
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:32,961
He will be missed.

1182
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:35,325
So I'd like to express my deepest consolences to the family.

1183
01:40:35,866 --> 01:40:39,552
So if we would all rise for a moment of silence for Jack Regan.

1184
01:40:53,022 --> 01:41:06,165
Offered by Vice President Lugo-Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Medford School Committee expand and implement the DARE program to the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.

1185
01:41:06,345 --> 01:41:07,245
Madam Vice President.

1186
01:41:07,305 --> 01:41:08,806
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1187
01:41:09,026 --> 01:41:18,008
I was lucky enough to be able to attend most of the meeting that was held at the Medford High School on last Thursday.

1188
01:41:19,563 --> 01:41:26,265
It was the Medford School Committee, administrators, somebody from Marion Ryan's office.

1189
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:29,006
What's her name?

1190
01:41:29,146 --> 01:41:29,646
Marion Ryan.

1191
01:41:29,686 --> 01:41:29,846
Yes.

1192
01:41:30,987 --> 01:41:31,287
What is it?

1193
01:41:32,247 --> 01:41:32,407
The DA.

1194
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:32,827
The DA, yes.

1195
01:41:32,947 --> 01:41:33,907
OK.

1196
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:34,468
Sorry.

1197
01:41:35,128 --> 01:41:42,270
Members of a number of principals.

1198
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,071
I'm blanking on a few of the organization's names.

1199
01:41:45,902 --> 01:41:57,672
It was a great group of people, the chief of police, the DARE officer, Officer O'Keefe, a number of Medford police officers were in attendance, Penny and Brooke from Team Medford.

1200
01:41:57,692 --> 01:42:04,137
And at that time, we were informed, just like the city council had their meeting.

1201
01:42:05,038 --> 01:42:10,042
We were informed, we were given statistics, and it was based around prevention within the schools.

1202
01:42:10,922 --> 01:42:28,531
We listened to representatives from the high school and the middle schools with regards to what programming there is within the schools, what is done, not necessarily all about prevention, but what positive influences are in the high school and what's done to steer children away, teenagers away from drugs.

1203
01:42:29,091 --> 01:42:30,392
And I thought it was very important.

1204
01:42:30,532 --> 01:42:32,553
I was able to stay for almost two hours.

1205
01:42:32,693 --> 01:42:34,834
I did have to go because I had to relieve a babysitter.

1206
01:42:34,854 --> 01:42:40,277
So I'm not exactly sure how the meeting ended, but one thing I did take away from it, and I'm not sure if the

1207
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:51,846
school committee, you know, talked about it further, was, you know, the fact that DARE program, the DARE program was in fifth grade, sixth, seventh, and eighth in the past, as well as the high school.

1208
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:59,130
When funding got tight, the DARE program was eliminated from the sixth, seventh, eighth, and the high school.

1209
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:09,796
Now, I'm not going to put words in the chief of police's mouth, but to me it seems very much so that he thinks, especially in the middle school, children would benefit from the DARE program.

1210
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,941
I'm a true believer in the program.

1211
01:43:13,282 --> 01:43:15,663
I've been a product of it.

1212
01:43:15,744 --> 01:43:24,370
I believe that it teaches against peer pressure how to resolve conflict, how to stay away from drugs, alcohol.

1213
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,553
I think it's something that is needed in the middle school.

1214
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:34,578
And whether that's the DARE program or there are new programs out there, I think we need something in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.

1215
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:37,020
I think the fifth grade, it's a great base.

1216
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:38,301
It's a great program.

1217
01:43:38,782 --> 01:43:40,343
It's definitely, definitely needed.

1218
01:43:40,915 --> 01:43:57,606
But I think we need to expand that, and I think we need to grab the minds of the sixth, seventh, and eighth graders and somehow push prevention, drug prevention, on them in a positive way from mentors, whether that's police officers or teachers.

1219
01:43:58,626 --> 01:44:01,048
I truly think that something is needed in the middle school.

1220
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:07,492
So I would just ask, whether it be the DEA program or another program, that something is implemented September 1.

1221
01:44:08,569 --> 01:44:12,132
to teach drug and alcohol prevention within our middle school.

1222
01:44:12,732 --> 01:44:15,855
So on the motion of approval by vice president Lago-Curran, councilman Knight.

1223
01:44:16,655 --> 01:44:21,879
Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you, councilman Lago, for bringing this resolution forward.

1224
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:24,341
It's very interesting.

1225
01:44:24,361 --> 01:44:29,405
The district attorney's report on opiate abuse came out and some of the statistics in there were staggering.

1226
01:44:30,065 --> 01:44:35,730
The average age of those afflicted by opiate and heroin abuse is 45 years of age.

1227
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:43,739
The number one community in Middlesex County that's suffering the most per capita is the community of Redding, a very wealthy and affluent community, Mr. President.

1228
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:55,872
And I think that it's also important to point out that nearly 100 percent of the individuals in Middlesex County that were categorized in this study were Caucasian.

1229
01:44:57,817 --> 01:45:03,105
It's very interesting to see the demographic breakdown, and I think that that's very important data, Mr. President.

1230
01:45:03,486 --> 01:45:07,452
The council has heard from the Board of Health on a number of issues.

1231
01:45:07,472 --> 01:45:08,774
We've heard from the Board of Health

1232
01:45:09,388 --> 01:45:12,210
on a resolution that they're going to be putting forward before this.

1233
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:18,773
I mean, I'm sorry, an ordinance that they're going to be putting forward to this council for review and approval that would be related to substance abuse, Mr. President.

1234
01:45:18,793 --> 01:45:31,920
And as an amendment to this resolution, which I wholeheartedly support, I would ask that we get a request, an update from the Board of Health on that ordinance as to what direction we're going in with that ordinance, where we are in the process, and why it hasn't been presented to this council for approval.

1235
01:45:33,721 --> 01:45:37,563
On the motion of Vice President Lou Kern, seconded by

1236
01:45:38,315 --> 01:45:40,036
Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1237
01:45:41,337 --> 01:45:42,717
Roll call has been requested.

1238
01:45:42,737 --> 01:45:44,958
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1239
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:48,840
Yes.

1240
01:45:50,301 --> 01:45:50,561
Yes.

1241
01:45:56,624 --> 01:45:56,884
Yes.

1242
01:45:56,964 --> 01:46:00,306
In the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1243
01:46:02,347 --> 01:46:05,749
Offered by Councilor Marks.

1244
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:26,645
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the Medford Middle School's String Ensemble for winning its fourth gold medal at the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Band and Orchestra Concert Festival.

1245
01:46:27,065 --> 01:46:28,346
Very nice, Councilor Marks.

1246
01:46:29,166 --> 01:46:30,286
Thank you, Mr. President.

1247
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:38,710
The Middle School String Ensemble has really had a large impact on

1248
01:46:40,711 --> 01:46:45,072
the concert festivals throughout Massachusetts.

1249
01:46:45,753 --> 01:46:54,996
This particular one is held in six cities across Massachusetts, with approximately 160 instrumental ensembles participating.

1250
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:57,617
This is the fifth year that they've medaled.

1251
01:46:58,017 --> 01:47:01,158
They have four gold medals and one silver medal.

1252
01:47:01,698 --> 01:47:07,460
And it's all been under the direction of Sophia Chang, who has done a tremendous job with these youngsters

1253
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:20,575
in getting the proper string equipment and also organizing the buses and organizing the students to participate in these particular festivals.

1254
01:47:21,056 --> 01:47:37,727
I would ask that the city clerk put together some council accommodations for the entire Method Middle School String Ensemble and that they receive citations at a future upcoming meeting.

1255
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:44,755
Mr. President, congratulating on them, congratulating them for their fine efforts in this field.

1256
01:47:45,535 --> 01:47:46,456
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1257
01:47:46,496 --> 01:47:46,916
Very good.

1258
01:47:47,096 --> 01:47:49,518
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, Councilor Knight.

1259
01:47:50,058 --> 01:47:53,441
Mr. President, I'd just like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward.

1260
01:47:53,461 --> 01:47:58,084
I think it's very important that we recognize the successes of individuals and of groups in our community.

1261
01:47:58,844 --> 01:48:04,048
I think that, you know, this resolution is a perfect segue into what we opened our meeting with this evening.

1262
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:07,740
It shows that the work of the Arts Council is paying off at the highest levels.

1263
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:12,063
We have our middle school string ensemble here getting high accolades, Mr. President.

1264
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:17,607
So that just shows what a commitment of the arts can do for the kids in our community, as well as the business and economic drivers.

1265
01:48:17,808 --> 01:48:21,870
So with that being said, I too would wholeheartedly second the approval of this motion.

1266
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:23,311
Very good.

1267
01:48:23,752 --> 01:48:25,593
So on that motion, all those in favor?

1268
01:48:25,613 --> 01:48:26,534
Aye.

1269
01:48:26,554 --> 01:48:27,154
All those opposed?

1270
01:48:27,254 --> 01:48:27,995
Motion carries.

1271
01:48:28,595 --> 01:48:33,759
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the Medford Community Coalition

1272
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:38,576
for organizing a cleanup of Medford Square on Saturday, April 25th.

1273
01:48:38,996 --> 01:48:39,677
Councilor Marks.

1274
01:48:40,517 --> 01:48:41,557
Thank you, Mr. President.

1275
01:48:42,017 --> 01:48:48,499
On Saturday, April 25th, I had the opportunity to go down and lend a hand to cleaning up the square.

1276
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:55,042
It was myself, Councilor Pinto was there, and he wheels a big broom, let me tell you.

1277
01:48:56,062 --> 01:48:58,783
This guy, I've never seen someone with a big broom like him.

1278
01:48:58,803 --> 01:49:02,684
He gets around, he did a lot of sweeping in the downtown area,

1279
01:49:03,634 --> 01:49:08,577
The cleanup, there was roughly 60 volunteers organized by Memphis Community Coalition.

1280
01:49:09,237 --> 01:49:14,760
We collected over 100 trash bags of trash and recyclables, Mr. President.

1281
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:30,068
The cleanup included Riverway Path, the library grounds, bus stops throughout the square, parking lots, and they also planted a number of pansies around the square area with soil donated by school committeeman Falco.

1282
01:49:30,867 --> 01:49:34,888
I know School Community Woman Paulette Vander Kloot was there also.

1283
01:49:36,288 --> 01:49:38,188
And like I said, a number of volunteers.

1284
01:49:38,608 --> 01:49:45,590
If anyone wants to get active, this particular group, the Method Coalition, Community Coalition, is really involved.

1285
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:48,510
They have a number of events set up over the next several months.

1286
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:58,472
You can visit facebook.com backslash methodcoalition or you can email them at methodcoalition at gmail.com.

1287
01:49:59,848 --> 01:50:02,369
And they're really a tremendous, tremendous group.

1288
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:08,492
And I look forward to their volunteerism over the upcoming years, Mr. President.

1289
01:50:08,912 --> 01:50:19,017
And it was just refreshing to see so many people come out on such a beautiful day and really, you know, with their kids and lend a hand to cleaning up an area.

1290
01:50:19,358 --> 01:50:28,282
I also want to thank, I'd be remiss if I didn't, Steve Tanaglia and his DPW crew that came out with the trucks, provided the bags, provided the shovels and

1291
01:50:28,746 --> 01:50:33,748
and rakes and brooms, and took all the trash away also.

1292
01:50:33,808 --> 01:50:38,309
So I wanted to personally thank Steve Tanaglia under his leadership, Mr. President.

1293
01:50:39,189 --> 01:50:39,549
Very good.

1294
01:50:39,569 --> 01:50:42,230
So on the motion of approval by Councillor Marks, all those in favour?

1295
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:43,130
Those opposed?

1296
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:43,771
Motion carries.

1297
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:53,373
Offered by Councillor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford Traffic Commission review the resident permit parking enforcement hours on Placetid Road from Irving Street to Century Street.

1298
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:56,675
Area residents pay for a residential permit sticker.

1299
01:50:57,055 --> 01:50:58,235
However, enforcement

1300
01:50:58,727 --> 01:51:01,168
only takes place between 11 p.m.

1301
01:51:01,248 --> 01:51:02,188
and 7 a.m.

1302
01:51:02,549 --> 01:51:03,309
Councillor Marks.

1303
01:51:03,969 --> 01:51:04,950
Thank you, Mr. President.

1304
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:28,179
I was contacted by a resident on Playstead Road, and this has actually been an issue for a number of years, but most recently, because of the new parking enforcement and the resident permit parking, residents now are getting tickets in front of their home, which they pay for, a permit sticker, but the permit sticker doesn't go into effect

1305
01:51:29,221 --> 01:51:31,922
until after 11 p.m.

1306
01:51:32,882 --> 01:51:38,784
And the issue, Mr. President, is apparently along Playstead Road, we all know Playstead Park is there.

1307
01:51:39,244 --> 01:51:41,365
On the park side, you can park there.

1308
01:51:41,445 --> 01:51:42,745
It's not resident permit parking.

1309
01:51:42,765 --> 01:51:44,005
You can park there with no problem.

1310
01:51:44,765 --> 01:51:53,808
On the opposite side where the homes are, there's permit parking, but from, I believe it's Irving Street all the way up to Century Street,

1311
01:51:54,976 --> 01:52:06,321
The parking, it may not be the full length, but I know directly across from Playstead Park, the enforcement is after the hours of 11 p.m.

1312
01:52:07,201 --> 01:52:11,883
until 7 a.m., so you can't park there unless you have a permit sticker between those hours.

1313
01:52:12,244 --> 01:52:19,647
But residents that may get home at six o'clock, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, coming home to an area, they can't find a parking spot.

1314
01:52:20,307 --> 01:52:22,748
And I think the whole intent with permit parking

1315
01:52:23,172 --> 01:52:28,454
is to at least give residents the opportunity to park near their home or on their street.

1316
01:52:29,035 --> 01:52:49,164
So I would ask that the Traffic Commission review this policy to see if there's anything we can do to make it so residents that are paying for a permit parking sticker receive the same benefits that everyone else receives, that if it's a permit parking street, only people with permits can park there.

1317
01:52:49,564 --> 01:52:50,965
And currently, that's not the case

1318
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:53,199
on a good portion of Playstead Road.

1319
01:52:53,579 --> 01:52:55,379
So I'd ask that that be reviewed, Mr. President.

1320
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,140
Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1321
01:52:58,180 --> 01:52:59,061
Councilor Caravaglia.

1322
01:52:59,081 --> 01:52:59,961
Thank you, Mr. President.

1323
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:01,862
I echo Councilor Mox's sentiments.

1324
01:53:02,722 --> 01:53:03,982
I've seen the people of West Medford.

1325
01:53:04,002 --> 01:53:13,626
I've heard the complaints about the cars parking there, especially now with the kiosks being there and the commuters are starting to slide off onto all those other streets now.

1326
01:53:14,526 --> 01:53:16,487
And actually, it isn't just on those streets.

1327
01:53:17,147 --> 01:53:20,468
It's pretty much all on that all high street Playstead Road bus line.

1328
01:53:21,784 --> 01:53:25,886
they're all getting a little, all those streets are getting a little clogged up with the commuters.

1329
01:53:26,646 --> 01:53:29,287
So again, I support Councilor Marks' petition.

1330
01:53:29,327 --> 01:53:34,729
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

1331
01:53:34,769 --> 01:53:36,209
Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this up.

1332
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:48,153
I brought this up a few weeks ago on two separate occasions relative to cars being swinged over there, but it's a result of the 16 cars that were allowed to park

1333
01:53:48,748 --> 01:53:51,109
on the corner of Winthrop Street and Playstead Road.

1334
01:53:52,230 --> 01:53:54,911
And right now, you're lucky if there's one car there a day.

1335
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:59,914
So take the average of 15 cars a day not being there at $5 a day.

1336
01:53:59,934 --> 01:54:01,235
That's $75 a day.

1337
01:54:01,735 --> 01:54:08,679
Once a month is $300, times 12 is $3,600 a year that they're not getting that they anticipated.

1338
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:13,381
And by pushing these cars onto the side streets over there, you're just going to compound.

1339
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,782
You're going to create another problem.

1340
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:18,880
that the resident parking, that these cars that are not capable of doing.

1341
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:30,922
I have a letter, which I'll bring next week, from a resident who tells me on four particular occasions how she had to go out and help people, not only negotiate the meter, but the glare.

1342
01:54:31,322 --> 01:54:34,742
Going right back to what you said, Rick, the glare of the meter, you can't see it.

1343
01:54:35,142 --> 01:54:37,323
It's unreadable.

1344
01:54:38,263 --> 01:54:41,203
Who put money in the meter did not get the right receipt that came back.

1345
01:54:41,563 --> 01:54:43,224
One got a receipt, two people later,

1346
01:54:45,142 --> 01:54:47,824
Another one put the money in the meter, got four quarters back for his quarter.

1347
01:54:48,564 --> 01:54:49,505
It's a stupid system.

1348
01:54:50,245 --> 01:54:52,887
And it's the stupidest thing that this mayor could have ever come up with.

1349
01:54:54,188 --> 01:54:58,311
He could resolve his whole legacy if he just comes forward and says, listen, we made a mistake.

1350
01:54:58,331 --> 01:54:59,151
We're going to get rid of it.

1351
01:54:59,411 --> 01:55:05,636
And we're going to go revert ourselves back to a local, as Councilor Marks alluded to, a revenue traffic enforcement program.

1352
01:55:05,676 --> 01:55:06,536
And we'll do it in-house.

1353
01:55:06,896 --> 01:55:07,877
And we'll start slow.

1354
01:55:07,997 --> 01:55:08,858
And we'll move forward.

1355
01:55:09,358 --> 01:55:11,099
This thing is not helping anybody.

1356
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:12,520
You can go to the business.

1357
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,821
The business merchants will tell you.

1358
01:55:14,285 --> 01:55:15,485
It is not helping us.

1359
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:16,966
As a matter of fact, it's so unfair.

1360
01:55:17,386 --> 01:55:22,968
You go to West Medford, they still have a meter in front of a residential home, but people are still trying to put it in, and they're not supposed to.

1361
01:55:23,268 --> 01:55:26,250
That meter should have been taken out of there months ago, and it's still there.

1362
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:34,533
How do you put a meter in front of a dentist, a one-dentist-person office on High Street, and the other one in front of a — in front of a what?

1363
01:55:35,533 --> 01:55:36,934
We'd call it a funeral home, okay?

1364
01:55:37,034 --> 01:55:38,034
I mean, it's unfair.

1365
01:55:38,054 --> 01:55:39,795
It's just — it just doesn't make any sense at all.

1366
01:55:40,695 --> 01:55:41,775
It's a killer to the city.

1367
01:55:41,875 --> 01:55:43,116
It's anti-business.

1368
01:55:43,647 --> 01:55:44,867
It's anti-citizen.

1369
01:55:44,887 --> 01:55:46,708
It's just anti-everything.

1370
01:55:47,548 --> 01:55:49,289
Medford is not downtown Boston.

1371
01:55:49,309 --> 01:55:50,689
It is not these places.

1372
01:55:51,449 --> 01:55:58,591
And as Councilor Mark's resolution points out, it's forcing people to go to other parts of the community to park their cars.

1373
01:55:58,931 --> 01:56:03,873
And you're going to start to see people really getting pedoed with people parking in front of their houses.

1374
01:56:03,893 --> 01:56:08,894
And you're going to see some damage done to these cars, because people, you know, someone turned around and sold something.

1375
01:56:08,914 --> 01:56:09,934
You can't tell me where to park.

1376
01:56:09,994 --> 01:56:11,635
I can go to the public street, and I can park here.

1377
01:56:11,675 --> 01:56:12,735
And this is the issue.

1378
01:56:13,627 --> 01:56:20,092
So this issue was really compounded and multiplied itself and it needs to be resolved immediately before something happens.

1379
01:56:20,532 --> 01:56:24,215
Something personal happens to the property and something personal happens to someone.

1380
01:56:24,515 --> 01:56:26,957
If physical altercations take place because of this.

1381
01:56:27,297 --> 01:56:28,638
So I thank you for putting that forward.

1382
01:56:28,678 --> 01:56:36,264
And I would ask Mr. President, Councilor Marks, I would ask that you forward, you want a response from the chief of police on this immediately, immediately on this matter.

1383
01:56:36,744 --> 01:56:40,987
So the motion of Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Penta, Madam Citizen.

1384
01:56:41,778 --> 01:56:44,439
Hi, Jean Martington coming straight, and I'm glad you brought this up, Mr. Marks.

1385
01:56:44,559 --> 01:56:50,761
I was just talking to a senior citizen today who often goes down, she lives in Medford, and she goes down to the senior center and all that.

1386
01:56:51,581 --> 01:57:06,466
She said that there's a lot of abuse of those placards, that people will take somebody's, you know, one of their relatives' placards, and put it on their car, and then is able to park in one of those, you know,

1387
01:57:07,374 --> 01:57:08,735
spots, the handicapped spots.

1388
01:57:09,196 --> 01:57:10,236
So I just wanted to bring that up.

1389
01:57:10,277 --> 01:57:23,747
So whoever is monitoring, whether it's the private company or whether it's the police, to just, she says that people cover the faces of the person and that they need to show the face of the person and try to clean that up because it's not right.

1390
01:57:24,107 --> 01:57:29,271
The people that need those spots should have those spots and the people that don't should walk.

1391
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:29,832
Thank you.

1392
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:41,250
just briefly, Mr. President.

1393
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:51,472
I think we're at the point, and we all took a vote recently, but I think we're at the point right now, Mr. President, that we really need to revisit this parking program.

1394
01:57:52,232 --> 01:58:08,295
And we had a meeting a couple of weeks ago, and we got a listing of the revenue that's coming in for the program, but we still haven't addressed the needs of the business community and the residents that I've been talking to, Mr. President, regarding these kiosks.

1395
01:58:08,901 --> 01:58:15,983
I think people are all in favor of moving cars along and providing consistent enforcement throughout the community.

1396
01:58:16,443 --> 01:58:20,045
I haven't heard one person say, you know what, we don't want enforcement.

1397
01:58:20,465 --> 01:58:27,287
People want enforcement, business owners want enforcement, the pay for parking program needs to be revisited in this community.

1398
01:58:27,647 --> 01:58:36,470
Now whether it's this mayor or the next mayor, that is the subject that I'm hearing out there in the community, and I'm not sure why the mayor's not willing to have a conversation

1399
01:58:36,964 --> 01:58:39,786
Maybe he's just going to let it be on the plate of the next person.

1400
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:46,791
But it's definitely the topic that's out there now, and the dialogue needs to take place sooner than later, Mr. President.

1401
01:58:48,432 --> 01:59:00,060
On the motion, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1402
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:05,083
Be it resolved that the Medford Traffic Commission review the resident permit parking enforcement hours

1403
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:08,981
on Playstead Road from Irving Street to Century Street.

1404
01:59:09,501 --> 01:59:12,841
Area residents pay for a resident permit sticker.

1405
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:16,422
However, enforcement only take place between 11 p.m.

1406
01:59:16,582 --> 01:59:17,402
and 7 a.m.

1407
01:59:18,322 --> 01:59:24,483
and response back from the chief of police immediately.

1408
01:59:26,144 --> 01:59:29,564
On the matter, we'll enforce this immediately to get an answer from the chief.

1409
01:59:30,004 --> 01:59:33,465
So send it to the mayor's office and the chief, the traffic commissioner and the chief directly.

1410
01:59:39,638 --> 01:59:42,641
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight.

1411
01:59:42,981 --> 01:59:43,221
Yes.

1412
01:59:43,722 --> 01:59:44,682
Vice President Long and Kern.

1413
01:59:44,702 --> 01:59:44,783
Yes.

1414
01:59:45,463 --> 01:59:46,104
Councilor Mox.

1415
01:59:46,344 --> 01:59:46,664
Yes.

1416
01:59:46,704 --> 01:59:47,345
Councilor Penta.

1417
01:59:47,385 --> 01:59:47,565
Yes.

1418
01:59:48,025 --> 01:59:48,906
President DelaRusso.

1419
01:59:48,926 --> 01:59:49,166
Yes.

1420
01:59:49,367 --> 01:59:53,810
With a vote of six in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

1421
01:59:54,351 --> 01:59:57,894
The records of last week's meeting are passed to Councilor Camuso.

1422
01:59:58,475 --> 02:00:05,841
In his absence, we will table those on recommendation of Councilor Caviello, table those records on the motion of Councilor Mox to adjourn.

1423
02:00:05,881 --> 02:00:06,562
All those in favor?

1424
02:00:09,027 --> 02:00:10,348
Oh, happy Mother's Day?

1425
02:00:11,048 --> 02:00:18,853
Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there, both near and far, and grandmothers, and mothers-to-be.

1426
02:00:18,873 --> 02:00:21,254
Yeah, that's a dangerous one.
