97
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Councilors.

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,580
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sterling Ortiz.

99
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,061
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for National Grid Electric.

100
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:50,868
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located at 170 Medford Street, Malden, and I'm here to speak about the proposed installation of pole labeled 4626-50 on Woodruff Ave.

101
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:54,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Mr. Ortiz in favor of the position.

102
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone else in favor of the petition?

103
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,254

104
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,537

105
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:08,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is now closed.

106
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ortiz, if you could give us a brief synopsis of the project.

107
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:24,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the purpose of the pole is right now the current configuration involves what we call a feeder tie where two circuits come into one pole and you're able to be energized one or the other.

108
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:33,108
[SPEAKER_00]: The same pole you also have an underground feed that comes right off the substation that's right behind that pole.

109
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:39,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for the new pole is to separate all that equipment into its own sole pole.

110
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:46,431
[SPEAKER_00]: That will create a safer environment for our crew and also add reliability for the future.

111
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:52,952
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything happens and we need to work, it doesn't create a dangerous environment for our crews.

112
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:56,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Ortiz.

113
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:57,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpello.

114
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: poll just to be clarification for for all the residents, you're actually talking about another poll that upright in our community in a city location, correct?

115
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,204
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

116
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:17,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

117
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:25,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you familiar with any double poles that are still left through national grid in the city of Medford?

118
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: So I myself don't handle the seat of Medford myself, but I do work with my colleague, who is Moses.

119
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:41,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I could certainly talk to him if there are any polls in question that you would like us to take a look.

120
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:51,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We've asked for years to eliminate all the double polls for the fact that one, it's a safety hazard.

121
00:07:54,067 --> 00:08:00,232
[SPEAKER_06]: poses problems for ADA accessibility, and aesthetically, it looks disgusting.

122
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:04,575
[SPEAKER_06]: This is only gonna be to erect one pole, correct?

123
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:05,696
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no other pole near that?

124
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

125
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:12,261
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just to erect one pole, and also just to add a little bit of information.

126
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:17,706
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see double poles, usually what happens is if we need to replace a pole, National Guard comes out, we

127
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:23,556
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the pole and we move all our assets to the new pole.

128
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:38,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when you have double poles is because Verizon and other telecom, whatever other attachments and other companies that might be on that pole, they have to follow through and make sure that they move their assets to the new pole.

129
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:46,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And Verizon is usually responsible for removing that pole that is the one that's attached to the pole that was just installed.

130
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:54,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, I can I can understand that but at the same time, with all the public utility companies that are doing work in Medford.

131
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:12,097
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of either your brother companies have erected these poles and walk away and then point to each other to say whose pole that belongs to to be taken down.

132
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:19,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my biggest, one of my pet peeves right now is that I still think we still have poles

133
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:27,222
[SPEAKER_06]: through National Grid that haven't been taken down, whether it was YAR doing or Verizon's doing.

134
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:32,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say this all due respect, Mr. Ortiz, I truly don't care.

135
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to see action.

136
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:47,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the only way to see action, if we talk to representatives like yourself, that you can go back to your supervisors and say, listen, Medford's really gonna hold back on allowing X, Y, and Z until we fix this

137
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:48,907
[SPEAKER_06]: these issues.

138
00:09:48,967 --> 00:10:07,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, like again, I'm sorry, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm shooting the messenger per se, but, um, I know this isn't probably all we are doing, but you have to understand where I'm coming from as a counselor, the, the issues we have when they're at double pole.

139
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, like I said, it's not in this, this, this location, but, um, I'd like to see how my polls by national grid.

140
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:17,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

141
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,843
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem, I will certainly pass along that message.

142
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:30,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk to my supervisor to make sure that we start proactive action to start looking at double poles out there and take all necessary measures.

143
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.

144
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,028
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

145
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Carvalho.

146
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:37,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

147
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I second Councilor Scott Pele's remarks on the double poles.

148
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:46,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's many left around the city, and again, I know it's not your fault,

149
00:10:47,905 --> 00:11:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, you know, someone's gonna have to address these double polls that are just left there for years at a time and, you know, hate to start denying permits until that gets done, but someone's gonna have to step up in this.

150
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,959
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you plan on putting this poll in?

151
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:13,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually we'll go through this hearing petition and then once it is granted or not,

152
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:15,509
[SPEAKER_00]: we hope that it's granted.

153
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:23,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We then normally jump into scheduling, but I really don't know when that will happen because I don't control the schedule.

154
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll depend, I really don't know.

155
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:31,520
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you guys really wanna know, I can certainly get somebody's information and then reach back and let you guys know.

156
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading what you have here, and I've got concerns on number five, six, and seven.

157
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:42,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess Steve Paul is in an area where there's grass.

158
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:51,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're gonna have to replace the loom and cede it to the approval of the public works.

159
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:52,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also a tree on there.

160
00:11:53,771 --> 00:12:00,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you going to be, is this tree going to be rerouted and National Grid's gonna replace the tree?

161
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:02,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

162
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:05,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And- That's a good question, councilor.

163
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make an inquiry about that.

164
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:11,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe is in our intention to remove a tree.

165
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:14,306
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can certainly confirm.

166
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:20,291
[SPEAKER_03]: He is removed, you won't work with the tree warden to replace it with a new tree?

167
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,113
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

168
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:31,820
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I believe that if we were to do anything with the tree, we would first, you know, make sure that we include that verbiage in the petition.

169
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:37,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, of course, make contact with the city in regards to touching any city-owned trees.

170
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:44,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so when it says here, I guess you don't have a final location of the pole, am I correct?

171
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in, what's it called, a furniture zone?

172
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside the limits of the- Go ahead, I'm sorry.

173
00:12:53,042 --> 00:13:00,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It says here, the final location of the pole shall be in the furniture zone, outside the limits of the existing driveway entrance.

174
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:05,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously this pole is not going back to where the other one was, correct?

175
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is no existing poll.

176
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:16,444
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a brand new poll that's going to be added in between, as you see on the sketch here, in between those two polls.

177
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:18,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at Google Maps right now.

178
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,790
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a driveway there.

179
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we utilize that driveway.

180
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:28,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if the intent is to put it somewhere in between this driveway.

181
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:35,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what happens is the pole is staked and then that will mark the location of the pole.

182
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:48,747
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is something that I could certainly chime back to you guys if I have someone's contact and I could stake it in the ground and then have your engineering group come out and confirm that location.

183
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:59,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd like if you'd work with a tree warden prior to this, to make sure that any tree that's there won't be damaged.

184
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:09,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the tree, if the roots are there, are gonna be damaged, that the tree warden make sure that a proper tree is planted in that spot there.

185
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.

186
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:15,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

187
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:21,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Ortiz, for being on the call and answering our questions.

188
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:42,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, and I apologize if you're not the person to whom this question should be directed, but I was wondering if there's a standard protocol that you follow for informing the residents that are adjacent to your work site of the work that you're doing, work schedule, what they should expect from the work being done on their street.

189
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:53,088
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's something that is usually farmed out to your city liaisons, sort of what the residents can expect if the permit is to be granted and if work goes ahead.

190
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor, for your question.

191
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:01,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regards to notifying the residents in the neighborhood,

192
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:15,858
[SPEAKER_00]: For a petition for this hearing, I'm sure the letters go out to them to make sure that they also are able to participate and their voices are heard in case they are opposed to having this poll installed.

193
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,005
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to National Grid notifying them directly when we're going to be out there,

194
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:38,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an answer for that, but I can certainly, again, it's one of those things that I could bring back to my colleague and tell him, or also the scheduler and also the liaison, to let him know if there's a way that we can notify everyone.

195
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:47,178
[SPEAKER_00]: But we always set up perimeters to make sure that the environment, the area is safe, the working area.

196
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Cronus, the clerk is also reminding me that the clerk's office will notify our monitors as well.

197
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

198
00:15:58,812 --> 00:15:59,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

199
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:00,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nait.

200
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:08,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I see this is no more than a request to put a 20 foot trench in and to put a pole in and I move for approval.

201
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:11,419
[SPEAKER_05]: On Councilor Nait's motion to approve, seconded by.

202
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:13,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Carviello.

203
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe I have anything on this, so.

204
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:19,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just on the,

205
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ortiz, it was requested by the council that you provide a report back to us on double poles.

206
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:31,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be possible for you to send a written report to our city clerk's office on that matter?

207
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I could certainly do that.

208
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:42,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if maybe there's a way that I could get that info, an email that I could just directly send that in and be in contact with that person.

209
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that would be the.

210
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, what was that?

211
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:53,468
[SPEAKER_05]: If you email it to the city clerk and the superintendent of wires, that would be sufficient.

212
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sounds good.

213
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You can give a phone call to, if you have a pen, I can give you a phone number to call in the morning.

[SPEAKER_04]: He served here proudly and admirably in the city of Medford, starting off as a patrolman and rising through the ranks to that of lieutenant, at which time I had the opportunity to become the chief of the Western Police Department maybe, what was it, four years ago?

00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:32,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And he left us.

236
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:37,627

00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:33,815

285
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:16,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.

286
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm.

287
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little loss of resume I apologize.

288
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so the, the number for the gender equity commission is 19 dash 312.

289
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:33,631
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councillor night seconded by Councillor Gabriella as amended by Councillor night and Councillor morale.

290
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

291
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:36,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

292
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:37,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

293
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:37,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

294
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:39,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

295
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, having affirmative zero, the negative motion passes.

296
00:22:52,222 --> 00:23:17,137
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-041, offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that the School Department seek a determination on eligibility for funding from the Community Preservation Committee for the purpose of addressing physical plant requirements to provide hot water to the locker rooms outlined in Council Paper 21-607, and be it so resolved that the City Council request the School Department seek a determination on eligibility for funding from the Community Preservation Committee

297
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:36,514
[SPEAKER_05]: for the purpose of resurfacing the field of dreams as outlined in council paper 21-606, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council request the Hormel Commission seek a determination on eligibility for funding from the CPC for the purpose of addressing physical plant requirements regarding hot water in the MHS pool locker rooms as outlined in council paper 21-605.

298
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:37,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Knight.

299
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:40,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

300
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:43,820
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a several papers that came up at the close of last session.

301
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But as we have CPA discussion starting tomorrow I thought it would be prudent for us to keep this on the forefront of the front burner.

302
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:55,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, we do have some physical plant requirements at Metro high school and in

303
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:14,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week's packet, if you went through it, you would have found in there a petition from a number of individuals that utilize our pool facilities at the high school complaining of lack of hot water when they use the facilities, aside from the fact that that is probably the grossest thing in the world because there's probably a violation of

304
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,221
[SPEAKER_04]: What about standards.

305
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:23,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that needs to be fixed we have a state of the pool, we have a state of the art science lab state of the art fields, but we don't have hot water in the locker.

306
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:26,127
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that should have been fixed long ago.

307
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:27,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And the funding is an issue.

308
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:36,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we seek an eligibility determination from the CPA to see if in fact we can use those funds to address this very basic and simple maintenance request.

309
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:52,889
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the resurfacing of the field of dreams, there was discussion regarding the condition of the field of dreams and I know Councilor Scott Pelley is far better versed at this than I am, but there is need for maintenance and upgrades at the field, and we've discussed a need for funding.

310
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, CPC is an opportunity for us to pursue funding for that.

311
00:24:57,253 --> 00:25:11,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, in our packet last week we also received a report from the home of the mission, aligning the physical plant requirements of one else stadium, and what we need to do an updated press box being one of the things they're right concessions them being another.

312
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,537
[SPEAKER_04]: projects that we want to undertake.

313
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:26,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a funding mechanism that's available for us in the CPC, so I'd ask that they also pursue an opportunity to see if they have eligibility for funds to pursue these endeavors.

314
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:34,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the measure, requesting that these entities take the appropriate steps to determine whether or not they're eligible for the funds.

315
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

316
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

317
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any further discussion?

318
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I could.

319
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:51,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think Council night for bringing this forward and I have no issue with this paper but I do see from a November 15 meeting of the school committee.

320
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:58,878
[SPEAKER_02]: They did approve funding for the repairs for the high school pool locker showers.

321
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:09,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's been an update on that work sense but that's from their November 15 meeting, but I, I see no issue with also seeking if this type of work qualifies for CPA funding.

322
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:15,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

323
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:21,470
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

324
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

325
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:28,332

326
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:28,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

327
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins?

328
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:30,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

329
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:31,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

330
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:32,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

331
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:33,574
Councilor Scarpelli?

332
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:33,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

333
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:34,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sanchez?

334
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

335
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Farage?

336
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:36,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

337
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:39,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice President Paris?

338
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:39,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

339
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an affirmative zero and a negative.

340
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:42,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

341
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,909
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-042, offered by Councilor Knight.

342
00:26:47,969 --> 00:27:00,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Being so resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion on the following question, colon, does the contract for the provision of body cameras fall under the requirements and provisions of Massachusetts general law, chapter 30B, section 12.

343
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

344
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mister President, thank you very much.

345
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: That chapter of the general laws is what limits a municipal contract to no more than 36 months.

346
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:15,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Just recently, we heard that the city administration had entered into a contract for police body cameras, which is something I'm sure we're all very excited about.

347
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:26,197
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it was also brought up that this contract was a 60-month term, which raised the question as to whether or not this type of program would fall under Chapter

348
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:28,013
[SPEAKER_04]: 30B section 12.

349
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:35,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to ask the city solicitor whether or not this paper would require council approval to enter into a contract that exceeds the statutory term of 36 months.

350
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

351
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

352
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:42,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Collins.

353
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

354
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:55,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have questions about how this contract overlaps or intersects or otherwise with the provisions laid out in 30B section 12.

355
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:58,423
[SPEAKER_01]: What's changed by it being grant funded?

356
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:00,824
[SPEAKER_01]: What parts of that provision apply or not?

357
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:03,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to receiving a determination on that.

358
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:06,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

359
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:11,448
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

360
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

361
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

362
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:20,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

363
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:20,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

364
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:20,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

365
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:20,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

366
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:34,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

367
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,178
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-043 offered by President Morrell.

368
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council meet in committee of the whole to discuss council priorities for 2022.

369
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:43,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Morrell.

370
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

371
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:51,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is a self-explanatory resolution and I move approval and with Councillor's support, look forward to scheduling.

372
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:03,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

373
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:03,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

374
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:33,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

375
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:36,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

376
00:29:36,889 --> 00:30:00,422
[SPEAKER_03]: 22044 offered by vice-president Beers be resolved with Memphis city council that the city administration provide full support to the efforts of Trees Medford in creation of a memorial grove to honor and memorialize the lives of Method residents lost to the COVID-19 pandemic.

377
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:01,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a further resolve

378
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: that the state administration provide an update on Council Paper 20665 regarding COVID-19 Memorial Commission and how these efforts could be continued.

379
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:13,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Biss.

380
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:14,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

381
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: This resolution comes after I was able to see a report in the Medford transcript about the efforts of Trees Medford to establish a memorial grove to honor and memorialize the lives of over 100 Medford residents who passed away due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

382
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:41,825
[SPEAKER_05]: A little over a year ago, I proposed a similar resolution in spirit that the city to have a commission to determine what a memorial may be.

383
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So the purpose here is to say that the council asked the administration to support the efforts of Trees Medford and also to report back to us on if they plan to have any sort of commission or other sort of group to figure out what this memorial could look like.

384
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:56,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

385
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:58,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

386
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:04,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So on a motion by Vice President Beers, seconded by Councilor Night, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

387
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

388
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:11,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

389
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:11,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

390
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:11,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

391
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:13,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

392
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

393
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:13,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

394
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:13,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

395
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:14,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

396
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:19,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven affirmative motion passes.

397
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:23,657
[SPEAKER_08]: 22045 offered by Vice President Beers.

398
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:44,290
[SPEAKER_03]: be it resolved that the Memphis City Council meet and committee as a whole to discuss support for our animal control officers' staffing needs in city rules and regulations.

399
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Betz.

400
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:46,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

401
00:31:47,651 --> 00:32:02,435
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in having several discussions with members of the community, you know, folks over at Brooks Estate, folks who utilize our parks, and Mr. Hogan, you know, it's become very clear to me that Mr. Hogan's, the workload on Mr. Hogan is very significant.

402
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:07,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Many communities have multiple animal control officers here in Medford.

403
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:09,740
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Patrick Hogan who does an amazing job.

404
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:17,607
[SPEAKER_05]: We got an email from him earlier this month about what he had done in the year 2021 and I think that was a very impressive amount of work.

405
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:23,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have one other person who's certified to be an animal control officer who is in the health department but is so overworked with

406
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:30,643
[SPEAKER_05]: the responsibilities of their job, but they're mostly not able to also assist with animal control.

407
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:51,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's worth bringing in our animal control officer to discuss both suggestions or support the council might have to provide additional resources to the office, as well as if there are any potential legal changes or provisions of state law that the city may be able to accept to improve his ability to do his work.

408
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, any further discussion?

409
00:32:56,692 --> 00:33:00,494
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Nighton.

[SPEAKER_05]: 22 dash zero four six offered by councilor Caraviello.

428
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:35,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council request the mayor and veteran service director engage in talks with the town of Winchester to regionalize their veteran service with our department.

429
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

430
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Chester has reached out to us.

431
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:51,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they don't have a veteran service officer there anymore.

432
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've inquired about having Medford take over their veteran services for them.

433
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:06,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they have a large amount of veterans in Winchester, but I think this would be a good thing for our office.

434
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:14,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It would help, obviously, boost our office with recognition of taking over two cities.

435
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:24,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Winchester would help pay for the salary of Mike or maybe another person to help out in the office.

436
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, again,

437
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good thing for us.

438
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:32,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it helps out another town with veterans in another city.

439
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, now, when we were in trouble, other cities stepped up to help us out.

440
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's time, you know, maybe we step up and help someone else out.

441
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:45,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I just let the mayor talk with the people from Winchester.

442
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:52,125
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can get some of his salary paid, cuts down on our budget and increases our visibility.

443
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:54,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Councilor Kerrio.

444
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:55,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nye.

445
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:10,404
[SPEAKER_04]: As I stated when we went through the whole entire situation, fiasco, whatever we want to call it, with the administration's actions to the Veterans Service Director, I took a position and that position was that I opposed the regionalization of the Veterans Service Office.

446
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:13,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt as though the City of Medford deserved to have

447
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:19,148
[SPEAKER_04]: a dedicated representative for the veterans, and I feel as though Winchester's veterans deserve no less.

448
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand where Councilor Caviello is coming from.

449
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that Winchester has a personnel problem, but they can't staff their position.

450
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly have no problem with the City of Medford helping out, but I do want to be sure that the City of Medford remains the number one priority.

451
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:35,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, regionalization is not something that I support.

452
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:38,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very weary of hearing the word regionalization.

453
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:41,034
[SPEAKER_04]: When I hear the word regionalization, it makes me think

454
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,716
[SPEAKER_04]: county government we all know how well that worked out.

455
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:51,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said I will be opposed to this measure this evening, but I can certainly respect and appreciate where the council is coming from and why he's bringing this measure forward.

456
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more about a philosophy on government than it is about anything else.

457
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:57,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President?

458
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:05,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councilor Mayne, maybe that was the wrong word for me to use, but maybe merging of two offices.

459
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:13,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really what, it was an intent, the intent wasn't to bring in like multiple other states, but they have reached out to us.

460
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:17,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the intent of the motion.

461
00:36:17,406 --> 00:36:18,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an amendment?

462
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:21,427
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no amendment, yes.

463
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the word isn't the right word, but again, the only intent is,

464
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:36,611
[SPEAKER_03]: is to bring in maybe the few veterans of Winchester-Terraz, and so they get services that they need.

465
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:44,358
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may have a question, would... How do I phrase it?

466
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Would this come back to us in the future?

467
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:51,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Would we have to agree to this merger as a council?

468
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,632
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think this would lie strictly with the mayor.

469
00:36:54,652 --> 00:37:00,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have anything, but again, I would assume that Winchester would help fund the office.

470
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:10,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So sort of, you know, take a little bit of the burden off us and, you know, and if they pay for, you know, maybe we could staff it with another person.

471
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:12,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's really the whole intent.

472
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

473
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Further discussion, Councilor Sharp.

474
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council President.

475
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:29,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello, I understand, I appreciate where you're going with this, but at the same time, I didn't realize that this would be followed up with, this is what we're asking for with a lot of what ifs, and that's what I'm a little nervous about.

476
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:41,903
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going to the mayor's office, you know, I don't want to go the other way and say, well, let's share, let's send our stuff over to another community.

477
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that doesn't happen.

478
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:50,498
[SPEAKER_03]: By law, we are supposed to have a veterans office in the city.

479
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not shifting guys.

480
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:56,265
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nobody and they don't have a large veterans office there.

481
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:58,448
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also think, like you said, the work

482
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: The workflow, he does a lot right now in the city of Memphis for our veterans.

483
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I wanna help the veterans in Winchester.

484
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:19,266
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's raised to work with a partnership with the city of Winchester while they're continuing to find solutions, I would support that.

485
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:25,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But to do this, I know that it's just a word, but regionalizing means that

486
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,773
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, oh, hey, that's great.

487
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:31,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, let's, let's have Maldon jump in.

488
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:39,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, Mr. Durham now, who's phenomenal in his job, is really picking up a heavy load.

489
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:41,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to say that they don't need support.

490
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,965
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the veterans in Medford are first and foremost.

491
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's my, that's my, my

492
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:49,936
[SPEAKER_06]: my hesitation with this, but I appreciate bringing forward.

493
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:59,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand where you're coming from and every intention that you have, Mr. Caviello, is always support the veterans in both our community and across Massachusetts.

494
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,901
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a slight to that at all.

495
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:08,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that, you know, I'd rather, you know, I'd like to see it maybe word a little bit differently, but.

496
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:12,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have used the wrong word, but I did talk to Mike on this.

497
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:20,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't think the extra workload would be because of the small amount of veterans they had in Winchester.

498
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:28,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way we can maybe bring to him just a quick meeting, a subcommittee meeting, or a committee of the whole?

499
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:31,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to vote against it, but maybe to talk to Mike and ask him.

500
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:33,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to know what the numbers are.

501
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,018
[SPEAKER_06]: If the numbers are 300, we don't know.

502
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the numbers are 10, I can't see why.

503
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:40,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you want, I'll call a subcommittee meeting with the veterans.

504
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,982
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can do that, I'd rather do that.

505
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to vote against it, because I have questions.

506
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:56,931
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, if the mayor is in charge and we're taking in 10, what would we could petition Winchester to say they pick up 10% of Mike's salary, if that's a way to work this partnership with Winchester.

507
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:59,012
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd appreciate if you did that.

508
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take care of that.

509
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk to Mike, and we'll have a subcommittee meeting on the Veterans Affairs.

510
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:06,958
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I don't know who's on that.

511
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:09,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm the chair of that committee.

512
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who else is on that committee with me.

513
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:20,320
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councillor Carviello to refer this paper to the Subcommittee on Military and Veterans Affairs, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

514
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

515
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, on the motion to refer to the Subcommittee, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

516
00:40:33,282 --> 00:40:33,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Carviello?

517
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:34,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

518
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:36,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Collins?

519
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:36,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

520
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Councillor Knight?

521
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:43,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

522
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:43,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

523
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:43,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

524
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:43,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

525
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:44,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

526
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

527
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:56,199
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion is referred to subcommittee 22-048.

528
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:05,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank all the people who supported our fight with Encore that hopefully had some influence with wind pulling back on their expansion plans.

529
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:06,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Carviollo.

530
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:07,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

531
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something we talked about a few weeks ago.

532
00:41:09,588 --> 00:41:14,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone's been following the story, wind has pulled back

533
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:23,280
[SPEAKER_03]: on their plans to develop their 1800 seat entertainment theater.

534
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:30,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope that all the pressure that the other communities along with us obviously had

535
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:36,711
[SPEAKER_03]: some influence on the Encore, realizing they were wrong, trying to backdoor this.

536
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:38,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So just want to thank people.

537
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this fight's not over.

538
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:44,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still gonna, it's still gonna, it's gonna rear its head again.

539
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:58,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, let's not, let's, again, we have no legal representation on this at the moment, but let's not let this die and keep fighting this until that project is stopped.

540
00:42:00,363 --> 00:42:01,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

541
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:03,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

542
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and thank you, Councilor Carviello for bringing this forward.

543
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:10,578
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, you know.

544
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:30,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

545
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:58,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we lost our, the audio is off on Zoom.

546
00:43:58,237 --> 00:43:58,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't hear anything.

547
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:51,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up on the screen.

548
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:52,037
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

549
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:53,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can hear.

550
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:59,241
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

551
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:02,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, blame the baby.

552
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:08,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're blaming Shane.

553
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:16,450
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good?

554
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,950
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

555
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:20,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

556
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:24,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, do we have papers in committee?

557
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:25,409
[SPEAKER_05]: We report to committees.

558
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Representative committees 22-025, January 12th, 2022.

559
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:33,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the whole report.

560
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:37,432
[SPEAKER_05]: This was on the flooding at high street and Woburn street intersection.

561
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:40,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

562
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:42,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve by councilor Knight.

563
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:44,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by councilor Cabriello.

564
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:45,774

565
