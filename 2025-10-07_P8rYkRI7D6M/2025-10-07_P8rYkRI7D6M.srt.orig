108
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:01,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

109
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on.

110
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on one second.

111
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there you go.

112
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's red.

113
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:19,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

114
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:20,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so.

115
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Haley.

116
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:25,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Haley.

117
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I already said that.

118
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a senior in health assisting.

119
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:34,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And as an incoming freshman, I honestly had no idea what the vocational pathway was.

120
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I heard about it, I had to try it out.

121
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:40,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea what I wanted to do.

122
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:42,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought it was a good way to find out.

123
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:46,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Going through the rotations, it was really appealing to me.

124
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:53,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved almost every shop, and I tried to picture myself in any of those situations.

125
00:57:54,399 --> 00:58:00,061
[SPEAKER_08]: When it came to health assisting, I first thought I could never see myself in health care.

126
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:04,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly thought I was going to hate it, but I came out with an open mindset.

127
00:58:04,642 --> 00:58:10,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And going through those four days, I just realized how much I understood already and how

128
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:12,516
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting I was.

129
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:16,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from there, I knew it was for me.

130
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Health assisting was my first choice and I got in without being waitlisted.

131
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And ever since then, my shop has been my happy place.

132
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:26,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I met some of my favorite people there.

133
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:29,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And without Mr. Fimo, I wouldn't be where I am today.

134
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only have I met good people in my shop, but in the vocational school as a whole.

135
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:39,100
[SPEAKER_08]: My classes and the hallways around me are filled with a positive environment.

136
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel welcome in any shop I walk into and we all help each other out.

137
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:47,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't count how many times a kid from automotive comes in looking for a bandaid.

138
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:57,636
[SPEAKER_08]: After high school, I plan to go to college and get my master's degree and become a physician's assistant.

139
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:02,699
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wouldn't be able to even imagine that without vocational school.

140
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

141
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:08,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Gabby Calicci.

142
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:10,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a senior in the cosmetology program.

143
00:59:11,105 --> 00:59:13,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Exploratory also helped me decide what I wanted to be in.

144
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:19,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, I went into freshman year wanting to be into business, and I was like dead set going into business.

145
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as I went through the rotations, I loved Cosmo.

146
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got in without being waitlisted, and it was my first choice.

147
00:59:30,522 --> 00:59:38,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, after high school, I plan to go to college and open my own dance studio, which has nothing to do with Cosmo, but it's one of those things that you can do both.

148
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:43,132
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a person that loves to do both and being, going through the Vogue has let me do that.

149
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:50,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I love the Vogue just because as Haley said, the community that it creates, like, if you know me, I'm in every single shop but my own during the day.

150
00:59:50,598 --> 00:59:54,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Had nothing to do with electrical, but Cormier was going to get sick of me soon.

151
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, how you doing tonight?

152
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Will, as previously stated.

153
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:14,874
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, when I was, I knew when I was really young that I didn't wanna just sit at a desk job and kind of sit around and type buttons on a computer all day.

154
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:19,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And granted, that sounds like pretty fun for some people, but for me, it wasn't the thing.

155
01:00:19,937 --> 01:00:28,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I was interested in how things work, you know, looking at like things that I didn't understand, like escalators and the Bermuda Triangle, which I don't know if they figured that out yet,

156
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:30,462
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get there, I guess.

157
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:37,346
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, electrical was one of those things that I never really got much of it at first.

158
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:39,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what, what is this?

159
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:40,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this just heat?

160
01:00:40,508 --> 01:00:43,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this like, I don't, I got nothing.

161
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:51,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, when I started at the high school and was able to go through the vocational rotations and all that, I had a really positive experience in all the shops.

162
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:53,176
[SPEAKER_10]: All of them were very welcoming.

163
01:00:53,196 --> 01:00:54,576
[SPEAKER_10]: The teachers were very knowledgeable.

164
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:57,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have firsthand experience.

165
01:00:57,598 --> 01:01:06,441
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of those people, they're not teaching just from a textbook, they're teaching from a place where they've been and you don't always get that a lot of times at a regular school.

166
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:11,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was very thankful to have met all the people that I have and have all the connections that I do now.

167
01:01:12,304 --> 01:01:15,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can only recommend it for other people because it's treated me great.

168
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:21,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And after high school, I planned on, you know, maybe someday opening my own electrical company or business.

169
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:24,513
[SPEAKER_10]: It would really be great for me.

170
01:01:24,533 --> 01:01:32,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be great for someday if I start a family or something like that, but right out of high school, gotta start at the bottom, work my way up, and it's gonna be a great time.

171
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:34,618
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I know for sure.

172
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:35,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

173
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:45,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Sarah Carboni, a freshman currently in the process of the CTE Exploratory Program at Medford High School.

174
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:51,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Prior to the program, I was never once in my life told that someone could make a comfortable living without going to college.

175
01:01:51,848 --> 01:01:52,449
[SPEAKER_12]: and going broke.

176
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:58,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, prior to Oh, sorry.

177
01:02:03,677 --> 01:02:12,904
[SPEAKER_12]: The longest time I was told if you don't, if you don't go to college, you won't be able to make money, which then you won't be able to make a living, and you'll be homeless.

178
01:02:15,352 --> 01:02:19,775
[SPEAKER_12]: But thanks to the CTE program at Medford High School, I have learned that this is thankfully incorrect.

179
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:35,606
[SPEAKER_12]: During the program, I have learned several things about the job industry and many different wonderful perspectives of the hands-on aspects of jobs such as that, such as electrical, automotive tech, carpentry, et cetera.

180
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:42,371
[SPEAKER_12]: The Exploratory Program gives students more information on all these useful and amazing professions

181
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:50,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if I or other students chose not to join, still hold very valuable skills in them.

182
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:59,058
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, this past month I learned how to change a tire, which is something I believe everyone should learn regardless of whether they choose to do it or not.

183
01:02:59,618 --> 01:03:01,860
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a skill that most people can't do on their own.

184
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:05,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So the fact that I was able to learn it thanks to this program means so much.

185
01:03:06,725 --> 01:03:12,248
[SPEAKER_12]: from coming from people who actually did this stuff for a living for a long time and who are very passionate about it.

186
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:16,809
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing talking and listening and learning from these people.

187
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:26,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Having exposure towards other career paths is a very valuable thing to any student and I think many, if not all, people should at least try the program.

188
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:27,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

189
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say that.

190
01:03:59,686 --> 01:04:09,017
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to two things to say one, a huge shout out to Mr. Fallon, because he really does run all of these businesses.

191
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:17,386
[SPEAKER_16]: While he's assistant print you know while he's the principal of the book and it always amazes me, your organization is just

192
01:04:18,445 --> 01:04:27,793
[SPEAKER_16]: amazing to me, I'm a huge Vogue fan, my son is also in electrical and did karate with you, I think, maybe probably 10 years ago, so just FYI.

193
01:04:28,513 --> 01:04:40,563
[SPEAKER_16]: And then my daughter just graduated Meffitt High, a Vogue student, culinary, loved it, and decided today that she's majoring in criminology and a minor in forensic science, nothing to do with the kitchen.

194
01:04:41,484 --> 01:04:41,684
[SPEAKER_16]: But

195
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:54,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there is this huge myth that we've talked about many times here that, you know, you can still go to the Vogue, you can still go to college, you can go to the Vogue for culinary and become a forensic scientist.

196
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:56,029
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

197
01:04:56,489 --> 01:04:59,370
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and I think busy hands are busy minds at school.

198
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:06,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, when I was in high school, wasn't that long ago, but I went to Medford High.

199
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:11,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to Medford High too, and you couldn't cross that line.

200
01:05:12,063 --> 01:05:15,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And I talked to Ms.

201
01:05:15,543 --> 01:05:22,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Freely, Freitas Haley the other day, and I was saying that we couldn't cross that line when we went to Medford High.

202
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:29,686
[SPEAKER_16]: If you were a Vogue student, you were a Vogue student, you had a different start time, a different end time, you were not allowed to cross the line.

203
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:32,086
[SPEAKER_16]: You got in trouble, you got detention if you went over to the Vogue side.

204
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:34,927
[SPEAKER_16]: So I love how much we've incorporated all of this.

205
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:35,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that.

206
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:37,967
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are happy.

207
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,247
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to go to school.

208
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,488
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I remember so many days my daughter saying, I'm not going.

209
01:05:41,528 --> 01:05:42,648
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, well, you can't go to culinary.

210
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:45,469
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was like, I'd love that it's the end of the day for you guys.

211
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:49,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of you, you know, Dominic's a sophomore and he has to wait till the last two periods.

212
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,870
[SPEAKER_16]: That is so strategic.

213
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:56,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it because it gets them there and they want to stay and they want to stay till the end of the day.

214
01:05:57,051 --> 01:05:59,632
[SPEAKER_16]: So yay, go Vogue.

215
01:05:59,732 --> 01:06:01,372
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to keep promoting the Vogue.

216
01:06:01,472 --> 01:06:02,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So keep talking about it.

217
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:02,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

218
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:03,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep doing good.

219
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:04,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Really proud of you guys.

220
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:05,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

221
01:07:41,532 --> 01:07:41,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's on.

222
01:07:42,012 --> 01:07:42,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

223
01:07:43,053 --> 01:07:43,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

224
01:07:44,173 --> 01:07:45,294
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great presentation.

225
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up we have our CTE lottery report so I'll call up Mr. Chad Fallon, our executive director of career and technical education.

226
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:55,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Mr. Fallon.

227
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:14,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you begin, Mr. Farrellin, I just want to say that just as a segue, listening to your voices and your perspectives as to what the CTE pathways and programs have meant to you and to have the freshman perspective,

228
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:27,971
[SPEAKER_02]: of the importance of doing the exploratories and the fact that we have a comprehensive high school that has been able to provide this sort of learning environment and experience for our students is really quite special.

229
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:40,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I appreciate that you took the time to share a little bit of that with us and inform us as we engage in a really important conversation around CTE programming,

230
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: and the lottery process.

231
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Mr. Fallon is going to explain to us a little bit of the regulation that this board of education has come down with in terms of how we're assigning students to career technical education programs.

232
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Ms.

233
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:03,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheila Freitas-Haley is here and works a lot in partnership with Mr. Fallon.

234
01:09:03,718 --> 01:09:04,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you both very much.

235
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Floor is yours.

236
01:09:47,028 --> 01:09:47,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

237
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:50,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Little feedback there.

238
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:58,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, you should know that they got a real kick out of seeing you in your element because they knew you when they were younger and they were like, wow, it's really fun to see her now as the mayor.

239
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:00,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cool to be part of.

240
01:10:01,816 --> 01:10:02,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone.

241
01:10:04,017 --> 01:10:13,622
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here tonight to talk about the new regulations that will be in effect for this school year regarding a lottery for admissions into career technical schools across the state.

242
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:21,845
[SPEAKER_00]: So in May, the Board of Education did vote to adopt a lottery for admissions.

243
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:23,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't need to stand that close.

244
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:30,030
[SPEAKER_00]: For admission into CTE schools, for our regional vocational technical high schools and for programs.

245
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:40,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do wanna share some information with you tonight specifically about that and share our thoughts on where we think we wanna move in the direction for this school year, because the regulations do begin this year.

246
01:10:41,743 --> 01:10:43,444
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to walk you through a few things tonight.

247
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:50,890
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to frame it, an admissions lottery is necessary in programs or in schools when you have more applicants than you have seats.

248
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:58,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember over the last three years, we've had about anywhere from 30 to 50 students on wait lists here in Medford alone.

249
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:04,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 30 to 40 of them are students who didn't get any of their programs.

250
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 20 to 30 are students who didn't get their first or second choice and maybe were placed in one of their other choices.

251
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:22,695
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Education is also looking that we reinvest our time and energy to work with middle school students to provide them information on pathways and access for high school.

252
01:11:23,675 --> 01:11:31,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the policy that you may read out there now is really geared more towards the regional vocational high schools that have sending communities.

253
01:11:32,502 --> 01:11:33,522
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that issue here.

254
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We are welcomed in the middle schools and we have a great partnership.

255
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really don't need to have an extensive plan.

256
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:40,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plan will really just outline

257
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:47,969
[SPEAKER_00]: open houses that we do and the work that we're going to do in the middle schools beginning in seventh grade and some course selection information.

258
01:11:51,931 --> 01:12:07,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So beginning in this school year for the 25-26 school year, we are proposing that students at the conclusion of the CTE exploratory rotation, which will be in January, that they're going to still continue to rank their top three choices

259
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:13,699
[SPEAKER_00]: but that for programs that have more student interest than seats available, we will employ a lottery.

260
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:25,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Students will still be placed on wait lists, or we'll have the option to choose a program that has space available, and students will be selected from the wait list up until the end of first quarter and sophomore year.

261
01:12:27,154 --> 01:12:36,099
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to keep in mind, if we have programs that do not fill on the first time around, students can opt into that program as well.

262
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:40,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only going to have to institute wait lists on programs that fill up.

263
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:45,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a program that has 20 seats and there's 18 students who sign up, then that program will not be on a wait list.

264
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:47,686
[SPEAKER_00]: All 18 students would get that program.

265
01:12:51,388 --> 01:12:53,689
[SPEAKER_00]: The state gives a few options with this.

266
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:04,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't feel it best to do an admission in grade nine before they came in because a lot of reasons, mainly because of the work we've done to integrate both schools.

267
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:09,852
[SPEAKER_00]: We really didn't feel it was appropriate to have an application or an admissions policy for grade nine for kids to enter.

268
01:13:10,952 --> 01:13:19,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're choosing the option of program placement, which is right in line with our neighboring communities, Somerville, Peabody, Quincy, Cambridge.

269
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:21,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's doing pretty much a straight lottery.

270
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:25,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may decide to do a weighted lottery, which is also an option.

271
01:13:26,598 --> 01:13:29,760
[SPEAKER_00]: we have decided or are proposing to not do a weighted lottery.

272
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:34,283
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel like a straight lottery would probably be the most beneficial and fair process.

273
01:13:38,186 --> 01:13:40,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a little bit about the middle school exploration policy.

274
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:43,649
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a document that I have drafted and we will share.

275
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:46,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shared with you and we'll share with the state.

276
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:52,875
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just outlines the work that we're gonna continue to do in middle school to help kids understand the programs that are available to them in Medford.

277
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick enrollment update to give you an idea of where we're at today.

278
01:13:59,071 --> 01:14:01,532
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just about 280 freshmen.

279
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,852
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 318 in the freshman class.

280
01:14:03,912 --> 01:14:06,313
[SPEAKER_00]: About 280 of them are in exploratory now.

281
01:14:07,413 --> 01:14:15,016
[SPEAKER_00]: The high school enrollment right now is at about 763 and 469 students in grades 10 through 12 are in a CTE pathway.

282
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:19,157
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes up the 1,200 students in the school right now.

283
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:22,338
[SPEAKER_00]: The number to keep in mind here for grade 10

284
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:26,355
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 181 seats.

285
01:14:27,135 --> 01:14:42,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, that would have been 145, but because of the additional seats we were able to add last year, hiring a fourth teacher, a third teacher in culinary, a third teacher in auto tech, we've been able to expand some access for students in those programs.

286
01:14:44,825 --> 01:14:57,835
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next steps are to hopefully get an approval of our admissions policy that's been shared with you or time to have me come back and speak more if there's questions and approval of the middle school exploration policy.

287
01:14:58,635 --> 01:15:02,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those documents will need to be sent to the Department of Ed after we have your seal of approval.

288
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:13,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step after we decide which option we're going to move forward with, with your blessing, really the communication plan will begin.

289
01:15:14,067 --> 01:15:21,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll begin reaching out to the community, speaking to parents, speaking to seventh and eighth grade students to make sure everyone understands what this is gonna look like moving forward.

290
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:27,917
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, working with families of grade nine students right now to let them know what is on the horizon for this school year.

291
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:34,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions?

292
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:46,960
[SPEAKER_05]: We can share.

293
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:53,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this.

294
01:15:54,675 --> 01:16:08,162
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I think, overall, this plan makes sense and I think there's a lot of complications with weighted admissions that have been talked about in the

295
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:10,357
[SPEAKER_15]: process this decisions been made.

296
01:16:10,437 --> 01:16:12,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm supportive of these policies.

297
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:23,309
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask that we really think carefully about the communication plan because I do think it has left lots of questions over time with families.

298
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:28,453
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think what we heard from students is I didn't know you could go to the book and go to college.

299
01:16:28,854 --> 01:16:35,319
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have heard in multiple parent centric meetings like,

300
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,803
[SPEAKER_15]: that may have been what was true when you were in school, but it's not true anymore.

301
01:16:41,123 --> 01:16:44,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the end of the sentence and the end of the statement.

302
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:48,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think parents leave going, well, why isn't it true?

303
01:16:48,327 --> 01:16:49,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what does that mean?

304
01:16:49,468 --> 01:16:50,929
[SPEAKER_15]: What what are my choices?

305
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:58,453
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think there's an opportunity to enhance the communication so people can really understand what the programs have to offer.

306
01:16:59,154 --> 01:17:01,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And like, what

307
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:05,620
[SPEAKER_15]: what typical pathways look like in and out of the programs.

308
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:13,949
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other thing I would ask is that we think about carefully about the ninth grade decision like it's happening earlier in the year than two years ago.

309
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:19,014
[SPEAKER_15]: I would personally like to see us spend more time exploring before we

310
01:17:19,775 --> 01:17:40,860
[SPEAKER_15]: ask ninth graders to sort of pick a track forever, but we can talk about that in future years but what I would like to make sure that we do is really think carefully about how we inform families about this decision because I think that has, I think it has always come from a place of people who know a lot about the process and

311
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:49,185
[SPEAKER_15]: One, you know a lot about a process, you tend to skip over the like really basic questions that people have that then they don't get answers to and they wonder about.

312
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:57,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think there's just an opportunity to tighten up some of the language that we use so that people who only think about the VOC in terms of like how they

313
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:11,042
[SPEAKER_15]: saw it or experienced it or didn't experience it when they were kids themselves can like really help their students think and evaluate the decision so that students can go to school prepared to like make those choices for themselves.

314
01:18:11,102 --> 01:18:22,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think they're just some communication opportunities for us to clear up and I'm like really excited to see the like intentional ask about helping middle school families understand that because I think

315
01:18:23,612 --> 01:18:38,278
[SPEAKER_15]: The vocational programs have so much to offer that when parents are thinking about high school and where they want to send their children to high school, there is no other place where you can go and learn 18 different

316
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:44,125
[SPEAKER_15]: things right that is available to most of our students.

317
01:18:44,225 --> 01:19:02,463
[SPEAKER_15]: So understanding what that could look like and doing a good job communicating that I think just has huge potential to help people understand like why they should really seriously consider sending their kids to Medford High if they want their kids to have lots of exposure to that kind of opportunity.

318
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:16,275
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can connect with you offline, but I just think talking to some parents who haven't been through the process would probably be very helpful in like sort of driving out those questions that seem to like linger for people.

319
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, member Graham.

320
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go one mic at a time.

321
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me turn yours back on, one second.

322
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:25,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you gotta press the button.

323
01:19:25,957 --> 01:19:27,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Fallon.

324
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:33,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

325
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:34,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to respond.

326
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:36,645
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've shared with Dr. Galluzzi some plans.

327
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:45,613
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing about this year, especially given that this lottery is new, the way the calendar works now, knock on wood, no snow days until January or February, at least.

328
01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:48,975
[SPEAKER_00]: The last rotation ends the day before winter break.

329
01:19:49,396 --> 01:19:55,521
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an opportunity where when students are leaving before the vacation, they're going to be going home with a lot of information.

330
01:19:56,221 --> 01:20:01,625
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff will be sent for me, it'll be sent, parents will have information, and then we have some time.

331
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:04,187
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to place students right away in January.

332
01:20:04,228 --> 01:20:16,697
[SPEAKER_00]: We could extend Exploratory for a week or for 10 days to do some activities that I did just share with Dr. Galussi about really what you said, career planning and understanding what this decision means, because my goal

333
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:24,705
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's to have kids pick a program that they truly enjoy, it's also to help kids who aren't sure that they don't pick the wrong program.

334
01:20:24,966 --> 01:20:30,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Because essentially, this could get difficult and we're going to have people who don't get into programs that desperately want them.

335
01:20:31,032 --> 01:20:37,338
[SPEAKER_00]: My job and our job at the school is to really help kids understand what you want and what you may not want.

336
01:20:38,157 --> 01:20:44,262
[SPEAKER_00]: and to help them understand, don't pick a program because your friends pick it because that, you know, you may have 14 other people waiting to get in.

337
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:49,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear you and I'd be interested to meet with you and others to figure out what the best plan is.

338
01:20:50,027 --> 01:20:54,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Galussi knows we've been kind of waiting for some decisions and then the communication will start.

339
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:55,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

340
01:20:58,471 --> 01:20:59,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it okay if I expand on that.

341
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did just want to note, and I think that's why it was so important to to hear this perspective from some of the students who didn't the.

342
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:30,673
[SPEAKER_02]: rotations had you realize that you thought you were going in and maybe we're going to want to wind up in one shop and then the rotations had you realize that oh wait a minute I'm really aligned to the work that's going on here and I want to explore this a little bit more and this is you know where my interests lie.

343
01:21:30,713 --> 01:21:33,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is part of the reason why we're so

344
01:21:34,527 --> 01:21:48,154
[SPEAKER_02]: purposeful in wanting to make sure that this lottery is in grade nine after the rotations, so that there's some context in the decision-making and that we're not creating any sort of barrier to opportunity for our students.

345
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second piece is for the communication, we do wanna make sure 100%, and we also wanna make sure that we're doing this in varied modalities.

346
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be mailings and newsletters and emails,

347
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:26,946
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll use our district-wide platforms to do so, so final site and the talking points, but we also need to have some in-person and via Zoom informational sessions so that we're also providing that opportunity to come and listen, ask your questions, hear about the programs,

348
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And to your point, learn all of the specific details of what it means to make the decision to go into CTE for the rest of ninth grade, grades 10, 11, and 12.

349
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:41,263
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big commitment.

350
01:22:41,884 --> 01:22:42,744
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big decision.

351
01:22:43,444 --> 01:22:48,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And students, as well as caregivers, 100% need to know what that entails.

352
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:55,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that we're providing a little bit more detailed information moving forward.

353
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Member Reinfeldt, and then Member Ntoppa, and then I think we have a student who'd like to speak.

354
01:23:08,963 --> 01:23:10,264
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be happy to defer to a student.

355
01:23:11,785 --> 01:23:12,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeldt.

356
01:23:12,385 --> 01:23:14,246
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I keep trying to defer and you're not letting me.

357
01:23:14,386 --> 01:23:21,771
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so I've, can you say a little bit about how the rankings and the lottery interface?

358
01:23:21,931 --> 01:23:24,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it a lottery for everyone's first choice?

359
01:23:25,012 --> 01:23:32,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, because I see a lot of codependencies here on how that works, and we don't have to get into the exact combinatorics of it all,

360
01:23:36,173 --> 01:23:45,760
[SPEAKER_17]: That's, I think, something at least that needs to be addressed with students and saying, if I'm ranking it this way, how does that preference work?

361
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the dimension is challenging.

362
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:56,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of a platform, I need to figure out what we will be using.

363
01:23:57,257 --> 01:23:59,259
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different things we can use.

364
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:05,423
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is all of us comprehensive high schools meet together a couple times a month, so we'll be sharing best practice.

365
01:24:06,503 --> 01:24:13,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the plan is that we'll still have students rank, but let's use electrical for an example, a program that always fills up.

366
01:24:14,228 --> 01:24:21,813
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have 20 seats and there are 40 students and that's their first choice, the lottery will be based on those 40 students for that program.

367
01:24:22,774 --> 01:24:26,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go and order first choice for every program and see where we end up.

368
01:24:27,597 --> 01:24:30,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we need to go to a second choice lottery, we'll go there.

369
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give you more.

370
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what I was looking for.

371
01:24:35,482 --> 01:24:36,102
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new.

372
01:24:36,162 --> 01:24:37,523
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new for me too.

373
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:41,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be calling on Will to help me with the lottery because he's been through this at the middle school.

374
01:24:42,301 --> 01:24:43,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, great.

375
01:24:43,963 --> 01:24:59,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I was also hoping you could speak briefly about why the weighted system, why a weighted lottery doesn't feel like the right choice, because one of the things that I have heard around this is, well, should we be prioritizing career intent over

376
01:25:01,902 --> 01:25:08,888
[SPEAKER_17]: doing this for fun, I agree, not because our friends are doing it, but so what led to that decision?

377
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:13,632
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there are pros and cons of each and I'd like to hear more about why you're making this recommendation.

378
01:25:15,146 --> 01:25:18,230
[SPEAKER_00]: So the attendance and distance.

379
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:26,039
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I believe that the state has made this decision is because selective criteria doesn't always work and it's not fair.

380
01:25:26,059 --> 01:25:33,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hated, I was director of admissions at a school prior to this and we would receive a thousand applications for 500 seats.

381
01:25:34,518 --> 01:25:41,161
[SPEAKER_00]: If a student made a mistake in seventh grade and had one suspension, that could limit their chances from ever being part of a vocational program.

382
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:42,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar with attendance.

383
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:47,543
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look at seventh and eighth grade data, that doesn't necessarily represent the same child in grade nine.

384
01:25:48,684 --> 01:26:04,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at the weighted option, attendance and discipline, any suspensions, I think I can safely say that kind of around like-minded people, we were talking about it and we just didn't like the idea of a selective criteria.

385
01:26:04,415 --> 01:26:11,239
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that this, in a situation where no one is ever gonna be 100% happy, this felt like the best option right now.

386
01:26:11,339 --> 01:26:12,300
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we can change it.

387
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:16,003
[SPEAKER_00]: If we decide year one, we don't like it, we're gonna have to update this yearly with the Department of Education.

388
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:18,563
[SPEAKER_00]: we may decide that we want to change it.

389
01:26:18,903 --> 01:26:29,405
[SPEAKER_00]: For right now, the people around the table, we all, I think, had a common feeling that we didn't want to use selective criteria such as attendance or something like this.

390
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:39,267
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm finding is that most schools, like even one of the biggest regional vocationals around, they're also doing a straight lottery.

391
01:26:39,287 --> 01:26:43,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're all feeling like

392
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,135
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the best way to go because it feels the most fair.

393
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:56,242
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate that, because it wasn't necessarily clear what the weighting factors would be, whether it was a positive factor or a disqualifying factor.

394
01:26:56,262 --> 01:26:56,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

395
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:58,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have explained it better.

396
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:03,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So attendance, they're looking at the year previous to application.

397
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:08,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything less than 27 days out would allow you another chance in the lottery.

398
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:12,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Discipline would be a 37 H and a half in fraction.

399
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:15,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That would, if you didn't have one of those, you would have another weight in the lottery.

400
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:21,877
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the Department of Ed gave this kind of other option that if we wanted to have

401
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:29,534
[SPEAKER_00]: an interview or a recommendation from a guidance counselor or something other like interest.

402
01:27:29,674 --> 01:27:35,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this student attend an open house or did they, you know, we felt like it was a little bit out there.

403
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,143
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really know that that was the best way to move forward.

404
01:27:39,864 --> 01:27:41,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So that those are the qualifiers.

405
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:43,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that background.

406
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:46,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And then how are we doing on our wait lists?

407
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:47,171
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess we don't.

408
01:27:48,105 --> 01:27:51,347
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know what this year's exploratory will lead to.

409
01:27:51,727 --> 01:27:59,371
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, but I can tell you our, so when I mentioned about, you know, 50 students on a wait list, we're down to 15 right now, which is kind of what we anticipated happening.

410
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:01,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I have students coming off the wait list tomorrow.

411
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:05,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change, people move, people change their minds.

412
01:28:05,135 --> 01:28:10,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to bring kids in right up until still, you know, we'll have some more starting tomorrow.

413
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,199
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wait list is much better.

414
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And can I share a little something with the crew?

415
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,542
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, what's that?

416
01:28:18,517 --> 01:28:20,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was intentional really.

417
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:24,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I got the acknowledgement today.

418
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:26,581
[SPEAKER_00]: We've applied for two new programs.

419
01:28:27,082 --> 01:28:31,864
[SPEAKER_00]: We have decided to open plumbing sooner than anticipated because the need is there.

420
01:28:33,705 --> 01:28:44,011
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Department of Ed has recognized my intent and they are inviting us to go to part A of the four part process for plumbing and information systems and support services for the FY26-27 school year.

421
01:28:47,545 --> 01:28:48,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.

422
01:28:48,546 --> 01:28:57,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So inevitably, we're looking at a wait list like we have every year, but we now know we're gonna have, you know, maybe 30 additional seats available.

423
01:28:57,093 --> 01:29:00,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time is now, Dr. Galussi and I sat, Ms.

424
01:29:00,615 --> 01:29:04,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Freitas Haley, we all put our heads together and said, how can we make this happen sooner than later?

425
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the plan, stay tuned.

426
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,561
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fantastic news.

427
01:29:09,281 --> 01:29:22,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any way to preview it for the people currently in rotation to experience some presentation, I get that we can't get in there into a shop because it's not up and running, but

428
01:29:23,114 --> 01:29:26,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, because the process will really end in June with the Department of Education.

429
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:31,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to think that we're going to be approved, but I've had to find some space in a very old building.

430
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:32,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.

431
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:34,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did find some space.

432
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:38,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, anywhere that there was running water.

433
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:50,483
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal would be for next year to have an exploratory, and then the year after take in another group of exploratory.

434
01:29:50,503 --> 01:29:51,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll add each year.

435
01:29:52,632 --> 01:29:53,516
[SPEAKER_00]: in a perfect world.

436
01:29:53,717 --> 01:29:56,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember, through MSBA, we applied for plumbing and HVAC.

437
01:29:58,113 --> 01:30:03,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're ready for HVAC, but plumbing, we definitely, you know, we know the students that go to Minuteman right now are going for plumbing.

438
01:30:03,475 --> 01:30:04,855
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this, we know it's been for years.

439
01:30:05,856 --> 01:30:20,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of waiting for the new building, we decided to just do plumbing, hold off on HVAC, and when we're in the new space, hopefully in five years or so, that we'll have four to five years of plumbers under our belt that we can now have a thriving program to bring in HVAC.

440
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:26,243
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all works out and we're in some new space, you know, five or six years, we'll already have a headstart on the program.

441
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:28,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding a teacher, another story.

442
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:30,565
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're hopeful.

443
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:31,546
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

444
01:30:31,846 --> 01:30:41,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

445
01:30:45,236 --> 01:30:45,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

446
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:49,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the really good news.

447
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:51,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually, I was actually just at an event.

448
01:30:51,911 --> 01:31:04,146
[SPEAKER_09]: talking with a parent about why don't we have plumbing and what are the differences and what's what's the deal with that so that's really cool to hear that we have pulling this away, we have a lot, and we have the means to hopefully support that.

449
01:31:05,768 --> 01:31:13,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really happy to see that we have chosen to go instead of the sort of eighth grade rotation and looking at stuff, we're actually going towards the ninth grade.

450
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:21,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, I was just gonna really reiterate the importance of going through the rotation and seeing, you know, what your options are and what everything happens.

451
01:31:21,457 --> 01:31:33,103
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's this difference between, you know, theoretical career paths and applied career paths and folks going through it and saying, well, actually, I really liked the problem solving of culinary more than I ever thought I'd like.

452
01:31:33,575 --> 01:31:34,596
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, this and that.

453
01:31:34,696 --> 01:31:41,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So seeing that, that this that's the driving factor behind that is awesome.

454
01:31:41,481 --> 01:31:48,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I also love the ideology behind the thought of not doing a weighted with a lottery system.

455
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:52,618
[SPEAKER_09]: That sorry the ringing is insane.

456
01:31:53,978 --> 01:32:06,322
[SPEAKER_09]: You know we talked a lot about you know we've heard from students we've heard from other folks that the vote brings a sense of belonging that actually increases retention among students you know once students are doing the things that they love and doing that sort of you know it's kind of what the CCS are.

457
01:32:06,782 --> 01:32:09,183
[SPEAKER_09]: pushes, it is what the CCR pushes, project-based learning.

458
01:32:09,203 --> 01:32:13,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you learn the thing that you wanna learn, your retention goes, and that drives student success.

459
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:25,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for students who maybe don't feel that sense of belonging in school, didn't feel that sense of belonging in middle school because academia, like straight path academia wasn't for them, why put that against them to be admitted into the VOC?

460
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:31,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the VOC hopefully is what will help fix that and help fix the lack of that sense of belonging.

461
01:32:33,311 --> 01:32:35,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we also, part of member Graham's point of,

462
01:32:37,197 --> 01:33:00,749
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about what a modern day vocational school looks like and you know the whole thing of my graduation speaker said the same thing you know they said I go to the voc I won't go to college I said I won't go to voc I won't go to college now I've been accepted to all nine colleges that I you know applied to it was accepted in you know with huge financial aid packages because the voc isn't just an end part for people it is oftentimes a stepping stone into another career path maybe they're gonna go into something else

463
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:11,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they learn hey culinary is where how I got myself through high school because high school the four year first years of my life and now I'm going to go pursue something else that we don't have as a program like criminal justice like psychology like whatever.

464
01:33:12,743 --> 01:33:17,748
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we also have to do an important part of advertising our programs that are.

465
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:37,887
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe lesser enrolled, you know, looking at we, I'm very happy to see an increase in, no surprise to, you know, graphic design and talking about how we need to look at, you know, for maybe the programs that maybe have a lesser waitlist or have lesser enrollment, you know, talking about the advantages of what graphic design is, you know, we're doing a whole wayfinding study in the city.

466
01:33:38,467 --> 01:33:39,948
[SPEAKER_09]: you know what a big part of wayfinding is?

467
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:47,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Is how it's designed and how people read through things and how people understand information, informational hierarchy, everything, zoning, everything.

468
01:33:47,893 --> 01:33:52,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is determined by how you design the language and the graphics to do it.

469
01:33:53,456 --> 01:33:57,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if we're there yet, but I'd love to see that happening.

470
01:33:57,138 --> 01:34:00,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And business marketing being a stepping stone for any career path.

471
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you decide to go to, you wanna open your own business?

472
01:34:02,701 --> 01:34:05,123
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't do that if you don't know how to market yourself or run a business.

473
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:13,871
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two people in there now, six, nine, it's going down a little bit, but these are the things that we need to be doing to push as that stepping stone.

474
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:17,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the voc is sort of like an associate's degree, pushing up whatever bachelors you go to.

475
01:34:18,114 --> 01:34:19,615
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you don't do that, then that's fine.

476
01:34:20,216 --> 01:34:20,736
[SPEAKER_09]: One or the other.

477
01:34:20,796 --> 01:34:32,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's sort of the rant that I had in terms of this, but I'm really happy to see where this is moving forward and what we're doing, transforming the vocational program in-house.

478
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,507
[SPEAKER_09]: So really appreciate all the efforts there.

479
01:34:34,982 --> 01:34:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: you and your staff and faculty are all, and students are all doing today.

480
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:38,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

481
01:34:40,246 --> 01:34:42,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, member Tapa.

482
01:34:42,247 --> 01:34:46,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you mind passing the mic back to our student, Elachi?

483
01:34:51,474 --> 01:34:52,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one second.

484
01:34:52,174 --> 01:34:55,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, that's member Graham's mic on.

485
01:34:56,497 --> 01:34:56,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

486
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Apologies.

487
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:01,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Reinfeld graciously answered our question.

488
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for your time.

489
01:35:04,063 --> 01:35:04,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

490
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, thank you very much for the presentation.

491
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:09,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, member Olopade.

492
01:35:11,431 --> 01:35:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, member Olopade.

493
01:35:14,812 --> 01:35:15,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

494
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a quick question about the eligibility in the draft you provided us.

495
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:28,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that you mentioned that students that are promoted into the program is conditional based off of their ability to seek the following grade.

496
01:35:28,777 --> 01:35:32,098
[SPEAKER_11]: For students that, for example, aren't able to seek the following grade and they need

497
01:35:33,601 --> 01:35:44,426
[SPEAKER_11]: repeat a year, does that does that remove their eligibility to reapply to the program as well as how does that impact the I know for eighth grade the very least it's March is when the selection process begins in the lottery.

498
01:35:44,946 --> 01:35:54,110
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that does that impact the rest of the lottery system at all if a student is not determined to be unable to seek the next grade yet but they will be eventually some question makes sense.

499
01:36:09,658 --> 01:36:11,087
[SPEAKER_00]: it would not impact their chances.

500
01:36:12,576 --> 01:36:17,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year there might be a student or two who needs to do some more work.

501
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:22,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we let them either go through exploratory again, or we let them pursue different programs up until now.

502
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:25,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will be different with the lottery, but I don't ever see us saying no to somebody.

503
01:36:26,441 --> 01:36:28,441
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same thing for students who come into the district late.

504
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:31,903
[SPEAKER_00]: If they haven't had a chance to explore the programs, we let them do it again up until they're ready.

505
01:36:32,323 --> 01:36:40,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's a little different because we don't have a lottery, but I would never, if somebody needs that extra time, I would absolutely open them back up to the process.

506
01:36:40,506 --> 01:36:41,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome, thank you so much.

507
01:36:47,486 --> 01:36:48,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have a question.

508
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:59,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve the first reading of policy JFA a chapter 74 program emissions policy.

509
01:37:03,841 --> 01:37:07,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the rolls called would you like to say something, Dr. Lucy, I can.

510
01:37:08,345 --> 01:37:08,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

511
01:37:08,885 --> 01:37:11,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that I don't want to, I certainly don't want to derail the vote.

512
01:37:12,955 --> 01:37:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to first thank Mr Fallon but I also wanted to just comment on some of the pieces that the members were commenting on, I think one of the key pieces here is just in the way that we decided to make decisions about the lottery is our instructional vision that guides our work for the district does have an equity statement in there about making sure that we are

513
01:37:37,902 --> 01:37:43,004
[SPEAKER_02]: opening up opportunities for students and we're providing them access so that they can reach their full potential.

514
01:37:43,084 --> 01:37:46,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some of our students, that is through the CTE pathway.

515
01:37:47,005 --> 01:38:03,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we feel that the best way to make sure we're doing that and not creating barriers and making sure that we're holding up our instructional vision for the district is to make sure that we're doing the lottery in the ninth grade so that we're giving that opportunity for students to

516
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:08,574
[SPEAKER_02]: explore the electives and then go through the lottery piece.

517
01:38:10,936 --> 01:38:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, thank you very much, and I appreciate your partnership in this very important matter.

518
01:38:20,263 --> 01:38:20,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Brantley.

519
01:38:24,286 --> 01:38:26,368
[SPEAKER_16]: The Bistro opens tomorrow to the public, correct?

520
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:31,352
[SPEAKER_16]: The Bistro opens tomorrow to the public.

521
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:32,680
[SPEAKER_16]: 8am to 1245.

522
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, go, everybody go.

523
01:38:36,321 --> 01:38:36,821
[SPEAKER_16]: It's good.

524
01:38:37,102 --> 01:38:38,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's fun.

525
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:39,042
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great.

526
01:38:39,242 --> 01:38:40,403
[SPEAKER_16]: So okay, that was it.

527
01:38:40,743 --> 01:38:42,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, didn't mean to steal your thunder.

528
01:38:43,464 --> 01:38:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Brantley.

529
01:38:44,464 --> 01:38:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

530
01:38:45,364 --> 01:38:50,486
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

531
01:38:50,506 --> 01:38:51,846
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to roll call?

532
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,007
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

533
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:54,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

534
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:55,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

535
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:57,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

536
01:39:00,712 --> 01:39:03,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, we have member Graham.

537
01:39:05,693 --> 01:39:13,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we motion to waive the second reading so that we can pass this and move forward?

538
01:39:14,435 --> 01:39:18,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to waive the second reading by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeldt.

539
01:39:20,096 --> 01:39:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

540
01:39:21,877 --> 01:39:22,677
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

541
01:39:23,637 --> 01:39:25,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Second reading has been waived.

542
01:39:25,277 --> 01:39:27,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

543
01:39:28,738 --> 01:39:31,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, let's keep the plumbers in house.

544
01:39:33,462 --> 01:39:37,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I hope my son follows that path in a few years, so that's great news.

545
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, we have an update to CCSR donation from the Cummings Foundation, Mr. Richard Schrader, Director of the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

546
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:49,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

547
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:55,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, great job.

548
01:40:01,789 --> 01:40:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for allowing me to give an update on the program.

549
01:40:07,972 --> 01:40:12,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I do that, I want to thank the funders for the program.

550
01:40:14,194 --> 01:40:16,876
[SPEAKER_01]: The major funders, number one is Cummings Foundation.

551
01:40:17,276 --> 01:40:27,240
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given us a commitment of $460,000 that has basically supported the program most of the years we've been in existence.

552
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:31,462
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crystal Campbell Community Benefit Project

553
01:40:32,172 --> 01:40:39,354
[SPEAKER_01]: donated $165,000 for us to support the program.

554
01:40:39,754 --> 01:40:47,555
[SPEAKER_01]: In one year, in fact, there was a gap between the Cummings money, the three-year grant, and the 10-year grant, and they funded the program for a year.

555
01:40:47,895 --> 01:40:51,976
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us to continue the program without missing a beat.

556
01:40:53,997 --> 01:40:54,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 2013,

557
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:06,905
[SPEAKER_01]: These generous contributors enabled over 3,000 students to create over, let's see how many, 300 projects, basically.

558
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:12,708
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an estimate over the time we've been doing this, but the impact clearly has been very broad.

559
01:41:13,409 --> 01:41:25,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, there have been situations where the students actually have excelled and actually become civic leaders in Medford.

560
01:41:27,727 --> 01:41:47,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank the school committee for the continual support over the years, particularly the central office people, Noel, Jerry, and Suzanne, and the superintendent, who's always been a supporter and has been very helpful in maintaining the program and advising us on how to maneuver through the system.

561
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:54,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank our advisors and the staff in the program who actually make things happen.

562
01:41:55,352 --> 01:41:56,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, they've been

563
01:41:57,309 --> 01:42:04,211
[SPEAKER_01]: a tremendous group and have been mentors to the students that have allowed them to do these great projects.

564
01:42:06,512 --> 01:42:10,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And most importantly, I wanna thank the students for their work over the years.

565
01:42:10,353 --> 01:42:19,036
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of students go through and their work is inspirational and I believe they make the world a better place, which is our mantra.

566
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna make the world a better place, one student at a time.

567
01:42:29,388 --> 01:42:32,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to just clarify my role as grant manager.

568
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:37,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in charge of creating and implementing the budget.

569
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:46,951
[SPEAKER_01]: My role is to adhere to the guidelines of the grant and answer to the foundation for how the grant operates and how the money is spent.

570
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:50,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain records and prepare annual reports.

571
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:54,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I supervise the faculty and staff in the program.

572
01:42:54,352 --> 01:42:58,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I coordinate operations for all activities.

573
01:42:59,236 --> 01:43:01,817
[SPEAKER_01]: and grant objectives to support student success.

574
01:43:04,598 --> 01:43:08,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the main kinds of activities that grant manager does.

575
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:17,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also meet, we have a visit every year to evaluate the program by a representative from the Cummings Foundation.

576
01:43:18,324 --> 01:43:24,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we do this, they've always been very happy with the way things are operating.

577
01:43:27,087 --> 01:43:28,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So the budget, the proposed budget

578
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:30,330
[SPEAKER_01]: is flexible.

579
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:33,051
[SPEAKER_01]: It's designed to adapt to student needs.

580
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:42,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Faculty and staff stipends remain the top priority as they sustain high quality after school programming and student engagement.

581
01:43:44,459 --> 01:43:52,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Once school rosters are finalized and we know how many students we have, we can then decide, determine how many people we need on staff.

582
01:43:53,105 --> 01:43:56,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that's done, then we can go to other areas and

583
01:43:57,404 --> 01:44:00,627
[SPEAKER_01]: find those areas based on what money's left.

584
01:44:03,088 --> 01:44:13,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like mini grants, instructional materials, enrichment activities, professional development, guest speakers, field trips are all subject to what happens with the staff.

585
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:25,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my job, my responsibility to determine the best way to handle this in terms of money, what's best for the students and what's the most effective way of

586
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:33,480
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting and offering students a truly enriching experience in this program.

587
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:41,381
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a multi-year grant, which means that this grant we received this year is one of 10.

588
01:44:41,561 --> 01:44:45,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grant budget stays stable.

589
01:44:46,082 --> 01:44:48,583
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't close out in the school year, it's open.

590
01:44:48,943 --> 01:44:49,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a multi-year grant.

591
01:44:50,323 --> 01:44:53,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So most years we have, almost every year we have a surplus.

592
01:44:54,084 --> 01:45:19,157
[SPEAKER_01]: which goes to the next year, which allows us flexibility to do things that may be not considered at first, but now, because we have the funds and some interest has been provided that some students want to do something grandiose, a district-wide program, a principal has worked with an advisor and has a project that requires some extra money here and there, that's what happens.

593
01:45:21,499 --> 01:45:23,320
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the,

594
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:50,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so the closing point I wanna make before we go through the budget is that what we promote is project-based learning, which is a methodology that allows students to make decisions about themselves, that allow them to select what they wanna work on as a project, and the advisors help them.

595
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:55,142
[SPEAKER_01]: They're advisors, they're not teachers in the sense they don't teach them, they let students

596
01:45:56,712 --> 01:46:04,833
[SPEAKER_01]: design with their help the project, implement the project, and then complete the project and have some kind of demonstration of that project.

597
01:46:06,034 --> 01:46:18,756
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the school year, I provide you with a portfolio of all the projects and all the work the students have done, so that it shows you that it indicates what the benefit is to the students.

598
01:46:19,136 --> 01:46:21,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly can be life-changing events.

599
01:46:24,057 --> 01:46:25,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I have anecdotes, but I won't go through them now.

600
01:46:27,843 --> 01:46:35,905
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I wanna point out is that by doing project-based learning, students develop leadership skills.

601
01:46:36,925 --> 01:46:43,847
[SPEAKER_01]: They become compassionate leaders because through and by helping other people, they learn to be more compassionate and more empathetic.

602
01:46:44,907 --> 01:46:56,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also stress that they are leaders and we call them leaders because they're going out into the world, into the schools, the district, making changes that can help other people.

603
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:00,242
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes them feel good, and it also helps the community.

604
01:47:00,782 --> 01:47:02,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important point.

605
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:05,906
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of experience is life-changing sometimes.

606
01:47:06,406 --> 01:47:14,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is we're creating students who, in the future, will do things to help other people and not just for self-interest.

607
01:47:15,752 --> 01:47:18,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really the heart and soul of this program.

608
01:47:21,175 --> 01:47:26,759
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my overview, and I can go through the budget, but do I have any questions?

609
01:47:30,469 --> 01:47:31,190
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I'm so sorry.

610
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just say you were going to go?

611
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:43,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that I'm just clarifying so that the membership is aware that I just want to make sure we're going through what the budget is so that is that what we're doing next?

612
01:47:43,961 --> 01:47:44,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

613
01:47:46,143 --> 01:47:51,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So this projected budget is founded on this

614
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:53,230
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.

615
01:47:53,250 --> 01:48:02,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So every, this year, the teachers, advisors, we call them advisors, they get $2,500 for the school year.

616
01:48:03,097 --> 01:48:06,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Each school has one full-time advisor this year.

617
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:09,421
[SPEAKER_01]: There is money for an assistant advisor.

618
01:48:09,622 --> 01:48:13,985
[SPEAKER_01]: If the numbers of the students exceeds 25 or 30 students, we hire an assistant.

619
01:48:17,387 --> 01:48:21,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, on average, we've been hiring sometimes three,

620
01:48:22,312 --> 01:48:26,874
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes four, but not every school requires an assistant.

621
01:48:27,454 --> 01:48:28,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it depends on numbers.

622
01:48:29,154 --> 01:48:35,116
[SPEAKER_01]: We recruit, we want all the students we can get, but we can't make them select us.

623
01:48:35,476 --> 01:48:37,057
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what they desire to do.

624
01:48:38,857 --> 01:48:39,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list of advisors.

625
01:48:40,918 --> 01:48:42,379
[SPEAKER_01]: For the high school, it's Jen Silver.

626
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:45,200
[SPEAKER_01]: For Andrews Middle, it's Melanie North.

627
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:49,081
[SPEAKER_01]: For Glenn Middle, Grace Turnbull-Barr.

628
01:48:50,280 --> 01:49:07,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberts, Janelle, Colin McKenzie, Mr. Tuck, Connor Hamill, McGlynn Elementary, Nicola Napitano, Brooks, Lee Chasen, and this year, the Curtis Tufts, which is really a wonderful thing.

629
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:08,792
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had trouble getting advisors.

630
01:49:08,832 --> 01:49:11,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an advisor at the Curtis Tufts, Colin Flynn.

631
01:49:12,455 --> 01:49:16,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because it's a small school, the stepping is gonna be 1,500.

632
01:49:17,983 --> 01:49:21,504
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it gets to 10 students or more, we bump it up to 2,500 students.

633
01:49:22,384 --> 01:49:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every school is covered.

634
01:49:24,505 --> 01:49:27,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have what I think is an excellent staff this year.

635
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:29,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really looking forward to working with them.

636
01:49:31,788 --> 01:49:38,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So advisors category with what I just gave you without the assistance is $20,000.

637
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:42,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 35,000, at least 15,000 as a balance.

638
01:49:43,592 --> 01:49:47,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect we might have a couple of advisors, assistant advisors added.

639
01:49:48,186 --> 01:49:50,266
[SPEAKER_01]: but we won't know until we get the numbers.

640
01:49:53,127 --> 01:49:55,948
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have staff that support the program.

641
01:49:57,688 --> 01:50:16,772
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a district coordinator, project coordinator, Janelle Garland McKenzie, who works as the liaison for all the projects and serves as a support person, holds meetings, Zoom meetings once a month, and coordinates all the projects and helps them

642
01:50:17,515 --> 01:50:21,939
[SPEAKER_01]: the advisors with their projects and supporting them.

643
01:50:22,019 --> 01:50:31,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And also she allows them to meet together to work as a team on projects outside of their school building.

644
01:50:32,989 --> 01:50:37,794
[SPEAKER_01]: The administrative system does all the purchase orders and purchasing.

645
01:50:39,115 --> 01:50:40,296
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mary Lorton, she gets $1,200.

646
01:50:42,149 --> 01:50:44,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorial Gardens maintenance is Rebecca McGinnis.

647
01:50:45,092 --> 01:50:48,735
[SPEAKER_01]: She supports the vocational Memorial Garden and the high school Memorial Garden.

648
01:50:49,355 --> 01:50:53,579
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in front of the school with the plaque for Crystal Campbell.

649
01:51:03,868 --> 01:51:06,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically we have many grants.

650
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:09,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Now many grants are grants given to classroom teachers.

651
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,581
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with their students if they have a project after school.

652
01:51:12,801 --> 01:51:22,326
[SPEAKER_01]: They apply for that, they submit a proposal, and if I approve it, they get to do the mini-grant after school on their own time, and they get a stipend.

653
01:51:22,446 --> 01:51:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: It ranges from, depending on the project, it ranges from $500 to $1,000.

654
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:32,591
[SPEAKER_01]: We've allocated $2,000, but we don't know exactly that number yet.

655
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:33,792
[SPEAKER_01]: We will determine later.

656
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:39,601
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a web hosting service fee for Bluehost.

657
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:43,662
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our own webpage, which is what the foundation would like.

658
01:51:44,482 --> 01:51:45,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do that.

659
01:51:45,822 --> 01:51:49,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good news is on the other side, it's student-managed.

660
01:51:49,623 --> 01:51:50,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We have students managing it.

661
01:51:50,923 --> 01:51:58,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a student project to manage the webpage and gives them great experience and an opportunity to be creative.

662
01:52:01,925 --> 01:52:03,826
[SPEAKER_01]: We allot $200 per school for support

663
01:52:05,207 --> 01:52:13,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Instant owned supplies, it could be art supplies, paint, it could be cups, depending on whatever they need it for.

664
01:52:13,954 --> 01:52:17,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that money is allotted, it doesn't mean it automatically is used.

665
01:52:17,817 --> 01:52:20,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's not used, but it's there if they need it.

666
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:32,248
[SPEAKER_01]: As operational supplies, things like toner for the printer, paper, folders, envelopes, things like that.

667
01:52:34,259 --> 01:52:46,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Subtotal, when you add all these up, it's $30,000, which leaves $5,000 allotted to what we need for possibly and probably some assistance.

668
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:56,004
[SPEAKER_01]: If we stay within that budget, it ends up being $35,000, which is the projected budget for the school year.

669
01:52:58,185 --> 01:52:59,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my report.

670
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:01,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

671
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, thank you so much for the update, well detailed budget.

672
01:53:08,377 --> 01:53:09,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions, member Graham?

673
01:53:09,799 --> 01:53:13,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, press it one more time, sorry.

674
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, I guess I'm good.

675
01:53:22,168 --> 01:53:23,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll stand way back here because it's very loud.

676
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:26,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Two things.

677
01:53:26,472 --> 01:53:40,703
[SPEAKER_15]: One, when you do the annual report at the end of the year, can you please include the actual spending against the budget so that at the end of the year we can see what we plan to do versus what we did that's not been included previously?

678
01:53:41,943 --> 01:53:56,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my other question is whether is can you send the committee a copy of the original grant award and whatever contract language there is that we've agreed to is it is it just this one active grant or do we have two active grants right now?

679
01:53:58,775 --> 01:54:00,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And is there another one besides Cummings?

680
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Charter, if you could just press your mic button and I'll put you back on.

681
01:54:08,683 --> 01:54:09,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You can stay on.

682
01:54:09,404 --> 01:54:12,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like it's a little more in control.

683
01:54:13,067 --> 01:54:13,527
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

684
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:18,250
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one grant, the Cummings Foundation.

685
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:18,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

686
01:54:18,911 --> 01:54:20,752
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crystal Campbell funds were donated.

687
01:54:22,173 --> 01:54:25,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Bloomberg funds we got years ago, they were donated.

688
01:54:26,216 --> 01:54:27,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no budget around that.

689
01:54:27,697 --> 01:54:30,259
[SPEAKER_01]: The money is used to support the program as needed.

690
01:54:30,799 --> 01:54:31,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.

691
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:34,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, if you could send us a copy of the grant award from Cummings, that would be great.

692
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:35,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

693
01:54:38,321 --> 01:54:38,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

694
01:54:39,001 --> 01:54:39,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeld.

695
01:54:41,682 --> 01:54:44,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to thank you for this detailed information.

696
01:54:44,242 --> 01:54:45,483
[SPEAKER_17]: This is very helpful.

697
01:54:46,063 --> 01:55:00,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to urge you when future budgets are being prepared to make sure that the stipends kind of stay aligned with the work within the teacher's contract.

698
01:55:00,286 --> 01:55:02,487
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a lot of work done during the negotiations to

699
01:55:03,507 --> 01:55:05,208
[SPEAKER_17]: make the stipends proportional.

700
01:55:05,748 --> 01:55:08,630
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not part of that contract, and they seem consistent.

701
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:10,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been trying to go back and forth.

702
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I appreciate it.

703
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:20,555
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to have that on the radar, because lots of our clubs do lots of good work and the advisors and making sure that that's fair and equitable.

704
01:55:24,177 --> 01:55:25,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

705
01:55:27,919 --> 01:55:29,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comments, further questions?

706
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,900
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, I'm going to move on to number four.

707
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter.

708
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need an approval, though.

709
01:55:36,272 --> 01:55:39,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval by Member Ntapa, seconded by Member Branley.

710
01:55:40,515 --> 01:55:41,376
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

711
01:55:41,396 --> 01:55:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call, please.

712
01:55:59,789 --> 01:56:00,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo.

713
01:56:00,569 --> 01:56:01,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley.

714
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:02,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

715
01:56:03,158 --> 01:56:03,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ntapa?

716
01:56:03,918 --> 01:56:04,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

717
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:04,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olopade?

718
01:56:04,978 --> 01:56:05,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

719
01:56:05,418 --> 01:56:06,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rheinfeld?

720
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:06,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

721
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:06,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rossell?

722
01:56:06,959 --> 01:56:07,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

723
01:56:07,239 --> 01:56:07,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Longo?

724
01:56:07,879 --> 01:56:08,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

725
01:56:08,259 --> 01:56:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

726
01:56:09,999 --> 01:56:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

727
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:11,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

728
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:12,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

729
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:15,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, we have bus monitor reports.

730
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn it over to our superintendent, Dr. Galuzzi.

731
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:19,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

732
01:56:27,362 --> 01:56:27,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

733
01:56:29,423 --> 01:56:30,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your patience.

734
01:56:31,515 --> 01:56:33,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the dance of the microphones.

735
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So briefly, last year, as part of our ongoing conversations with the community, there was a hope to have some bus monitors implemented on some of the bus routes that we have across the city.

736
01:56:55,997 --> 01:57:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: In that ongoing conversation as part of the supplemental budget, which was presented on January 13th to this board, we reviewed the possibility at that time of incorporating bus monitors in areas of need.

737
01:57:13,586 --> 01:57:21,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a result of that conversation, there have been lots of internal conversations that have been had between central office

738
01:57:22,754 --> 01:57:35,344
[SPEAKER_02]: which has included multiple people, but because transportation is all encompassing and does require a lot of people at the table but I mean, john Bowen and Dr. Talbot Megan Fiddler Carrie myself know well.

739
01:57:36,985 --> 01:57:43,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people, Mr Pippa Sally have been on the central office side, engaged in conversations with principals.

740
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:48,253
[SPEAKER_02]: and assistant principals, as well as Eastern Bus itself.

741
01:57:48,273 --> 01:58:07,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those conversations have included a review of bus routes per school, a prioritization of the bus routes that are in the most need through a needs assessment type approach, the calculation of Eastern Bus monitors, as that was part of the contract that they gave us.

742
01:58:07,986 --> 01:58:10,387
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a quote in there, and we'll get to that in a future slide.

743
01:58:11,548 --> 01:58:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: A review of the assignments of paraprofessional duties through their new CBA and Schedule A capacity to assist in that nature.

744
01:58:21,477 --> 01:58:26,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Some contingency planning, because we always need to have contingency planning, all well-laid plans.

745
01:58:27,782 --> 01:58:36,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to monitor, we want to make sure we are creating a mechanism to monitor reports, concerns, questions, and coverages across the district.

746
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:52,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to assess the need for bus monitors, this conversation involved the creation of a tiered approach to allocating resource.

747
01:58:53,305 --> 01:58:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So that work, as mentioned, was collaborative with school leaders, Eastern Bus and Central Office.

748
01:58:59,948 --> 01:59:01,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked at student need,

749
01:59:02,663 --> 01:59:07,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked at enrollment or possible areas of overcrowding on buses.

750
01:59:07,846 --> 01:59:09,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked at safety concerns.

751
01:59:10,207 --> 01:59:19,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked at reports from either caregivers, bus drivers, Eastern Bus itself, community members, and the like.

752
01:59:19,913 --> 01:59:29,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And so taking all of those pieces of data into account, we came up with a tiered system, which was tier one is an immediate priority.

753
01:59:30,332 --> 01:59:39,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So more than one of these areas as highlighted above was brought up in reference to a particular bus at a particular school.

754
01:59:39,635 --> 01:59:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Tier two was an emerging priority.

755
01:59:42,216 --> 01:59:48,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't maybe require a bus monitor at this very moment, but we're keeping a close eye on it.

756
01:59:48,938 --> 01:59:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a genie in a bottle and funding was not an issue,

757
01:59:54,977 --> 02:00:02,262
[SPEAKER_02]: then this might be a place that we would put a bus monitor if the need arises.

758
02:00:03,763 --> 02:00:12,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Tier three was just to monitor ongoing, something that we're doing with all of our buses, but this is classified as we're keeping an eye on this bus.

759
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:14,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And tier four, currently stable.

760
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:23,136
[SPEAKER_02]: As we take these tiers into account, the next slide highlights for you

761
02:00:24,863 --> 02:00:26,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Pippa, Sally, do you mind moving?

762
02:00:27,044 --> 02:00:27,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

763
02:00:28,044 --> 02:00:30,886
[SPEAKER_02]: This next slide highlights all the buses.

764
02:00:30,946 --> 02:00:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 17 buses across the city from elementary to middle to high school.

765
02:00:36,428 --> 02:00:40,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And this prioritizes the tiers for every bus in the city.

766
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:45,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see based on our approach tier one, there are four buses.

767
02:00:46,713 --> 02:00:50,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pretty much one at each elementary school and one at the middle school.

768
02:00:51,345 --> 02:01:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, areas for the reasons why these buses are in tier one range from, um, student need and support to dismissal issues around dropping off at afterschool programs, middle school.

769
02:01:08,912 --> 02:01:15,515
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a popular bus for a lot of students to kind of hop on, go downtown to the library, visit their friends.

770
02:01:16,028 --> 02:01:23,032
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be overcrowding issues or just a little bit of shifting around buses, let's just say.

771
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:26,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You will note, I do not have the high school bus on here.

772
02:01:26,734 --> 02:01:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: The high school only has one yellow school bus that goes to North Medford.

773
02:01:32,197 --> 02:01:36,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone from the school leaders to Eastern Bus, that bus is stable.

774
02:01:37,841 --> 02:01:41,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the bus that's not on here, which is bus 17.

775
02:01:43,404 --> 02:01:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no reports of a need

776
02:01:46,210 --> 02:01:47,072
[SPEAKER_02]: in any capacity.

777
02:01:49,017 --> 02:01:50,521
[SPEAKER_02]: If we move to the next slide.

778
02:01:52,079 --> 02:02:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to refresh everyone's memories if people at home have not seen this, or just to make sure we say it one more time to the committee.

779
02:02:00,704 --> 02:02:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: As part of the bid contract for Eastern Bus last year, when the contract was up, they did give us a quote because we wanted to know.

780
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:16,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, it was our only bid, so we did not get a bid from any other bus company.

781
02:02:17,014 --> 02:02:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But their bid for bus monitors was $250 per day.

782
02:02:22,805 --> 02:02:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: per bus.

783
02:02:25,048 --> 02:02:35,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I engaged this year in conversation with them, and I can understand where they're coming from, but they gave the example of districts that they are with

784
02:02:36,339 --> 02:02:51,546
[SPEAKER_02]: that have bus monitors on their buses, Cambridge and Chelsea were the two that were given examples, they pay for the entire day because it's very difficult for them to find a bus monitor that's only going to work an hour to two hours a day.

785
02:02:52,327 --> 02:03:05,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So bus monitors in other districts where they have found success are riding the bus for the morning, for the afternoon and for the late bus transport for students home.

786
02:03:07,081 --> 02:03:12,026
[SPEAKER_02]: In converse, so you can see here from this, we have 17 total buses.

787
02:03:12,086 --> 02:03:19,252
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were to take $250 a day times 180 school days, that's $765,000 for bus monitors.

788
02:03:19,753 --> 02:03:28,301
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were, and then all the way down, so if we were to look at just tiers one, two, and three, and remove the buses that are stable, that gets us down to $675,000.

789
02:03:31,142 --> 02:03:40,288
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were to look at just tiers one and two, which knowing that these tiers will fluctuate through the year, but if we were just going to look at tiers one and two, right now that rate would be $405,000.

790
02:03:41,149 --> 02:03:54,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I did subtract two buses from this total, because if you go back to the chart before, there are two buses that overlap from the elementary run to the middle school run.

791
02:03:54,978 --> 02:03:58,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So I removed the cost of two buses to that total.

792
02:03:58,921 --> 02:04:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we just look at the four buses, which is tier one, it's $180,000.

793
02:04:02,604 --> 02:04:02,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

794
02:04:07,757 --> 02:04:23,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think for us right now at this point, it's not very fiscally responsible right now to say that we would be going with Eastern Bus to supply our bus monitor staffing.

795
02:04:23,602 --> 02:04:32,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that also part of that rationale is that engaged in conversation with school leaders and Eastern Bus, we

796
02:04:33,709 --> 02:04:38,053
[SPEAKER_02]: there is no report of a need for morning bus monitors.

797
02:04:38,813 --> 02:04:43,397
[SPEAKER_02]: The only need from the stakeholders right now is for the afternoon runs.

798
02:04:44,537 --> 02:04:49,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And so fiscally, it wouldn't be that prudent to do.

799
02:04:51,598 --> 02:04:53,319
[SPEAKER_02]: if we go to the next slide.

800
02:04:53,800 --> 02:05:14,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next part of the conversation is to provide some context a little bit for other ways that we can maybe look to provide some support on buses that are tier one to start and maybe looking at what we can handle for anything additional as need arises.

801
02:05:16,084 --> 02:05:25,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So as part of the recently negotiated and ratified contract with the paraprofessionals, there are two levels of paraprofessionals.

802
02:05:26,337 --> 02:05:33,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are Schedule B and some are Schedule A. Schedule A have additional hours of pay that

803
02:05:34,757 --> 02:05:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: they need at the discretion of principals to provide to the school in which they work in.

804
02:05:42,299 --> 02:05:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right here you can see an outline if elementary paraprofessionals Schedule A owe the district 29.83 hours of coverage throughout the year.

805
02:05:54,542 --> 02:05:57,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That's each para of Schedule A.

806
02:05:58,197 --> 02:06:05,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the average of elementary school paras that are schedule A is about four to five paras.

807
02:06:07,179 --> 02:06:14,300
[SPEAKER_02]: There are situations, there are two schools in which there may be more paras, but one works the afterschool.

808
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:18,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So that still brings us down to four to five right now at each elementary school.

809
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:27,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle school paraprofessionals do not owe any time based on the nature of the new schedule and the support that they provide in the morning.

810
02:06:28,548 --> 02:06:35,173
[SPEAKER_02]: and high school paraprofessionals on schedule A owe 19.53 hours to the district.

811
02:06:36,373 --> 02:06:48,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping all of this in mind, we are proposing, if we look at the two levels right now that are of need, we have elementary schools and middle schools.

812
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: We are proposing using a rotating use of schedule A paraprofessionals,

813
02:06:57,382 --> 02:07:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: that may be consistent or that also may be intermittent.

814
02:07:01,623 --> 02:07:10,365
[SPEAKER_02]: In conversations with principals and with Eastern Bus, of course, situations in need are different from school to school.

815
02:07:10,645 --> 02:07:26,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some schools where right now they feel like an intermittent need would be the most effective so that, let's say for a week or two weeks, you have a bus monitor, they're reviewing expectations, they're modeling to the students,

816
02:07:27,615 --> 02:07:43,924
[SPEAKER_02]: how they should be at when they're on the bus, when they're riding the bus, sometimes also how they should be getting off the bus, when their stop is, making sure that if there's certain grade, the bus driver's checking tags, all of those things.

817
02:07:44,505 --> 02:07:46,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may not need it consistently.

818
02:07:46,226 --> 02:07:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: We can roll that back, see how that goes if there's a need.

819
02:07:50,128 --> 02:07:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: reinstall it again.

820
02:07:52,009 --> 02:07:58,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So this rotating use of paraprofessionals would be supportive.

821
02:07:58,994 --> 02:08:08,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have talked about the possible incorporation of a small stipend or a stipend to staff members to cover Tier 1 supports.

822
02:08:09,041 --> 02:08:12,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the need arises for a Tier 2 bus,

823
02:08:15,718 --> 02:08:20,621
[SPEAKER_02]: that would also serve in that capacity, or if a tier two bus then becomes a tier one.

824
02:08:22,782 --> 02:08:36,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We also want, as said before, we are maintaining records internally so that we are keeping track of documenting reports, needs, and coverages across the district.

825
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:41,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Middle school, because paraprofessionals don't have the time,

826
02:08:42,113 --> 02:08:48,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The pieces that we looked at there are the stipend option, and we are in conversations with City Air.

827
02:08:48,298 --> 02:09:02,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not gotten a direct answer yet, but that's a possible talking point because we do have middle school core members, and the middle school buses are all merged.

828
02:09:02,649 --> 02:09:09,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So the McGlynn students, for people that may not be aware, even at home, the McGlynn students walk to the Andrews.

829
02:09:09,434 --> 02:09:09,954
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 12 buses.

830
02:09:11,535 --> 02:09:18,579
[SPEAKER_02]: and school leadership from both schools are there and present with Jessica from Eastern Bus assisting with boarding.

831
02:09:18,899 --> 02:09:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest takeaway from Eastern Bus was the support they need for middle school level is on boarding.

832
02:09:25,922 --> 02:09:37,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And the four buses that are tier one, they did feel that an intermittent approach would be best because if there is an adult or a staff member on those four tier one buses,

833
02:09:38,862 --> 02:09:52,352
[SPEAKER_02]: every day for boarding, setting the expectation, making sure students are seated, that it makes the ride a little bit more seamless.

834
02:09:54,994 --> 02:10:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I open the floor if there are any questions or pieces of feedback or comments for me.

835
02:10:06,102 --> 02:10:06,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

836
02:10:13,142 --> 02:10:13,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

837
02:10:14,383 --> 02:10:15,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this.

838
02:10:15,664 --> 02:10:23,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate that we are solving problems that we have known about for a really long time.

839
02:10:23,491 --> 02:10:27,215
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've, you know,

840
02:10:28,178 --> 02:10:31,039
[SPEAKER_15]: for a whole variety of reasons not done this before.

841
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:49,128
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for doing that and for doing it really thoughtfully, because I think, you know, it's not a good use of funds to just assume that support is needed on every bus every day for 180 days, because what we really want is to be modeling behavior that teaches kids how to ride the bus responsibly.

842
02:10:49,148 --> 02:10:55,351
[SPEAKER_15]: And the goal would be that you don't have tier one buses, but that there's a plan to respond when something happens.

843
02:10:55,391 --> 02:10:56,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really appreciate

844
02:10:57,212 --> 02:11:13,158
[SPEAKER_15]: the work that went into this and the collaboration between the Eastern Bus and your office and the principals, because I think that's how we actually start solving problems in the district.

845
02:11:13,178 --> 02:11:14,018
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for that.

846
02:11:14,858 --> 02:11:27,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only question I had is, if parents are seeing some need for to like sort of raise some awareness about a bus issue that they're observing in some way.

847
02:11:27,922 --> 02:11:30,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they contact the principal who do they contact.

848
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:36,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I actually have some fantastic news to answer that question.

849
02:11:37,333 --> 02:11:44,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have just hired a transportation manager position for the district.

850
02:11:46,919 --> 02:11:48,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a non-unit position.

851
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:53,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this person, Mr. Evan Schwartz, his first day is next Tuesday.

852
02:11:54,083 --> 02:11:56,405
[SPEAKER_02]: He is coming to us with experience.

853
02:11:57,507 --> 02:11:58,148
[SPEAKER_02]: in this role.

854
02:11:58,868 --> 02:12:07,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Most recently in for Brookline public schools in which Eastern Bus has had experience because Brookline is one of their districts.

855
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually have worked with Mr. Schwartz before, spoke very highly of his skill set, his professionalism.

856
02:12:15,004 --> 02:12:16,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited.

857
02:12:16,346 --> 02:12:17,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to

858
02:12:18,844 --> 02:12:20,165
[SPEAKER_02]: bombard Mr. Schwartz.

859
02:12:21,185 --> 02:12:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute he comes in, we will make sure that we are introducing him to the community, to this membership, if you so like.

860
02:12:28,990 --> 02:12:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We will make sure we send to parents and put on the website under the transportation, his contact information.

861
02:12:36,755 --> 02:12:39,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say first and foremost, it's the principals for sure.

862
02:12:40,517 --> 02:12:45,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once Mr. Schwartz gets going, he is going to be all things transportation.

863
02:12:47,208 --> 02:12:48,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

864
02:12:48,269 --> 02:12:49,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very important question.

865
02:12:55,618 --> 02:12:57,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeld and Member Russo.

866
02:12:59,226 --> 02:13:00,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

867
02:13:00,486 --> 02:13:04,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I was gonna ask what conversation had happened with City Year, but that got answered.

868
02:13:05,147 --> 02:13:18,250
[SPEAKER_17]: And then also I think the intermittent is a very useful model because what we don't want is we've kind of identified with the paraprofessionals contract that there are a lot of ways to support students with those hours.

869
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:25,832
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would, as urgent as bus monitoring is, I would hate for that to be all the only extra support paras are providing.

870
02:13:26,112 --> 02:13:27,893
[SPEAKER_17]: But my question is around training.

871
02:13:29,413 --> 02:13:38,120
[SPEAKER_17]: and who these bus monitors are reporting to in terms of how they're being trained, what's the supervisory, and what's the liability?

872
02:13:38,201 --> 02:13:43,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I know drivers are employed by Eastern Bus, and that's the contract.

873
02:13:43,785 --> 02:13:52,132
[SPEAKER_17]: So how does that work, logistically, managerially, and liability-wise?

874
02:13:52,693 --> 02:13:53,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a fabulous question.

875
02:13:56,475 --> 02:14:06,939
[SPEAKER_02]: In conversation with Eastern Bus, we did discuss the use of monitors that would be supplied by the district rather than supplied by Eastern Bus.

876
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:09,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in conversation with them.

877
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:15,482
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of training, I would say that the bus monitors report to the principal.

878
02:14:16,782 --> 02:14:19,364
[SPEAKER_02]: just to keep that chain of communication solid.

879
02:14:19,985 --> 02:14:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the principals that are hearing the reports or the concerns, mostly from caregivers, definitely from bus drivers, definitely from Eastern Bus.

880
02:14:30,653 --> 02:14:35,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to note that all the buses do have video surveillance.

881
02:14:36,458 --> 02:14:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes when reports are given to the district, depending on what the report is, school leaders are working with Eastern Bus to review the tapes.

882
02:14:49,787 --> 02:14:53,090
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, Mr. Lord, I'm sorry, I'm looking at you.

883
02:14:53,110 --> 02:14:56,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure, but I know it's video.

884
02:14:56,472 --> 02:14:57,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it also sound?

885
02:14:58,994 --> 02:15:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it audio recording as well?

886
02:15:02,990 --> 02:15:04,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to look into that.

887
02:15:04,431 --> 02:15:07,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's video, but I would just have to look into that one.

888
02:15:08,632 --> 02:15:11,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the training, Mr. Schwartz is starting on Tuesday.

889
02:15:11,553 --> 02:15:20,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is part of the conversation that we're having with Eastern Bus and Mr. Schwartz as he arrives.

890
02:15:24,338 --> 02:15:25,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So are we.

891
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:29,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Russo.

892
02:15:32,417 --> 02:15:32,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

893
02:15:32,797 --> 02:15:36,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to acknowledge how fast you turn this around.

894
02:15:36,459 --> 02:15:39,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we did just do the pair of contract.

895
02:15:39,862 --> 02:15:46,145
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like last week wasn't, but I wasn't really expecting all that to happen quite so fast.

896
02:15:46,205 --> 02:15:47,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm thrilled.

897
02:15:47,506 --> 02:15:48,086
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

898
02:15:52,989 --> 02:15:53,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Olopade.

899
02:15:54,543 --> 02:15:54,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

900
02:15:54,923 --> 02:15:56,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I had two quick questions.

901
02:15:56,904 --> 02:16:05,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that the to comprise the actual tiered system to a prioritization, you know, you implemented a couple different ways to the criteria or metrics.

902
02:16:06,489 --> 02:16:11,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a metric that we're working on to determine like the actual reduction of incidents and success of this as well as

903
02:16:12,646 --> 02:16:24,694
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever that may look like, are we able to kind of implement some type of mid-year report to kind of see how this is progressing so that hopefully we're seeing the numbers continue to go down so that ourselves and the district and I think families understand like why we're doing this.

904
02:16:25,595 --> 02:16:40,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the absolute goal, which is why that's part of our action steps in the internal documentation that we are keeping so that we are tracking reports when we've used coverages and how we've used those coverages and

905
02:16:41,749 --> 02:16:42,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our goal.

906
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:43,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're hoping to see.

907
02:16:44,412 --> 02:16:53,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the members input before I think there is a key piece around modeling, and I will say just, you know, one of

908
02:16:56,139 --> 02:17:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I also want to make sure that I haven't really in full transparency like done yet, but like also to keep the conversation going with Metro Police on the city side, the Roberts bus that is tier one, that's the bus that goes to the Boys and Girls Club.

909
02:17:16,293 --> 02:17:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had lots of conversations with Dr. Talbot, who has gone to every elementary school, seen dismissal procedures, lots of conversations with Megan Fidlecary.

910
02:17:28,015 --> 02:17:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of reports about all four elementary school buses kind of converging in a really compressed area of the city.

911
02:17:38,598 --> 02:17:44,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is happening is there's a large amount, there's a lot of students on that bus.

912
02:17:45,533 --> 02:17:50,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can also get you the ridership numbers, which vary dramatically from school to school.

913
02:17:51,196 --> 02:17:56,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that also factors into the tiered system, which is really why the McGlynn didn't have a tier one.

914
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:59,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Their ridership numbers are much lower.

915
02:17:59,801 --> 02:18:13,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I look at that bus at the Roberts, the ridership numbers are high, and there were more than one instance of students getting confused because so many students get off the bus for that afterschool program.

916
02:18:14,637 --> 02:18:17,689
[SPEAKER_02]: that some students are getting off that bus and it's not their stop.

917
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:26,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of the afterschool programs have a dedicated person that boards the bus, makes sure they have the right students, they get off the bus.

918
02:18:26,675 --> 02:18:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think part of this conversation too, which is why I'm very grateful for Mr. Schwartz to be here.

919
02:18:32,598 --> 02:18:39,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think part of this is also ongoing conversations with Eastern Bus, but with some of the afterschool programs.

920
02:18:40,742 --> 02:18:44,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if there's a possibility to put a crossing guard down there.

921
02:18:46,365 --> 02:18:57,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I would like to look into, but, and I haven't heard that there's necessarily as big of a problem with the other elementary schools as there was with the Roberts.

922
02:18:58,453 --> 02:19:00,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of little nuanced pieces there, yeah.

923
02:19:00,815 --> 02:19:01,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

924
02:19:02,897 --> 02:19:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

925
02:19:03,217 --> 02:19:04,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need to vote of any sort?

926
02:19:04,298 --> 02:19:04,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

927
02:19:12,175 --> 02:19:14,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

928
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:24,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I did just want to make sure as where I know we're going to move on to some resolutions, but I did just want to say this week.

929
02:19:27,637 --> 02:19:35,422
[SPEAKER_02]: At the elementary level, caregivers will be receiving the devil's early screeners sent home.

930
02:19:36,343 --> 02:19:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time we've done this in this manner and not during report card conferences, and I wanted to just make sure I highlighted it here we're making sure that we communicate that in

931
02:19:48,703 --> 02:19:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: the principal emails, the Friday memo, but just wanted to say it here so that parents are aware that it is coming home this week.

932
02:19:56,087 --> 02:19:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And so please be checking your child's backpack.

933
02:19:59,689 --> 02:20:00,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

934
02:20:00,029 --> 02:20:01,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you very much.

935
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: No continued business.

936
02:20:03,351 --> 02:20:06,893
[SPEAKER_03]: New business offered by member Reinfeldt, 2025-32.

937
02:20:07,573 --> 02:20:16,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the Medford School Committee unanimously accepted the ad hoc resolution that the design firm selected to work on the new high school present to the Medford School Committee and a public meeting before

938
02:20:17,378 --> 02:20:34,351
[SPEAKER_03]: commencing work on the feasibility study in January, be it now resolved that the seven individuals elected on November 4 2025 to serve on the Medford City Council for the term beginning January 12 26 shall be invited to attend this meeting of the medical committee were in the presentation is made.

939
02:20:34,371 --> 02:20:36,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to speak or you want a motion for approval.

940
02:20:39,835 --> 02:20:42,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve I think this speaks for itself.

941
02:20:42,239 --> 02:20:46,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for approval my bed for member rental seconded by member Graham all those in favor.

942
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:46,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

943
02:20:49,241 --> 02:20:50,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

944
02:20:50,642 --> 02:21:03,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the resolution and also offered by member Reinfeld, 2025-32, whereas the Medford School Committee desires to take student experience into account in its decision-making and understanding the impact of those decisions.

945
02:21:04,167 --> 02:21:18,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas student councils meet regularly in the schools to discuss issues relevant to the student experience, we have therefore resolved that the regular school committee meeting agenda shall include a designated block for presentations by student representatives.

946
02:21:19,093 --> 02:21:45,716
[SPEAKER_03]: and be it resolved that these presentations shall not preclude additional contributions by student representatives during the rest of the meeting, and be it resolved that the superintendent shall work with the student council leaders to encourage cross-school communication to inform presentations of student representatives, and be it further resolved that the school committee shall designate one member each season whom the high school student council may invite to attend their meeting on a monthly basis,

947
02:21:46,508 --> 02:22:04,300
[SPEAKER_03]: and be resolved at the school committee member in attendance at the school Students Council meetings shall act, primarily limit preliminarily as an engaged observer and shall not speak in any official capacity for the elected body in these meetings, and be it finally resolved that the rules of the member school committee and policy be

948
02:22:06,570 --> 02:22:14,133
[SPEAKER_03]: D E D B agenda creation in format of regular meetings of the school committee shall be updated to include these provisions.

949
02:22:14,573 --> 02:22:15,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeldt.

950
02:22:16,294 --> 02:22:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

951
02:22:16,954 --> 02:22:33,780
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is this resolution is meant to formalize the student involvement, given that we've had consistent student representatives, and we would like to really give them a place to speak, not mandatory, but the option and then to ensure a mechanism for

952
02:22:34,881 --> 02:22:52,782
[SPEAKER_17]: school committee to members to attend meetings at the invitation of and figure out how to do that without breaking open meeting law and with and acknowledging that many members of the committee are unable to commit to regular meetings and also that students deserve a space to be

953
02:22:53,683 --> 02:22:55,664
[SPEAKER_17]: with students without the committee present.

954
02:22:56,004 --> 02:22:57,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is designed to do that.

955
02:22:58,106 --> 02:23:02,248
[SPEAKER_17]: If my colleagues have questions, I would actually ask that they defer and let the students respond first.

956
02:23:02,588 --> 02:23:08,852
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't go back and forth on this just because of the timing for submission of agenda items and their meetings.

957
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:14,335
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would request that the students get to speak first and then I'm happy to take questions from my colleagues.

958
02:23:15,335 --> 02:23:15,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

959
02:23:15,695 --> 02:23:16,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, member Reinfeld.

960
02:23:16,796 --> 02:23:19,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to speak there or do you want to go up to the podium?

961
02:23:19,137 --> 02:23:20,118
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you feel more comfortable?

962
02:23:21,458 --> 02:23:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right there.

963
02:23:22,979 --> 02:23:24,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you can face us.

964
02:23:36,132 --> 02:23:41,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remind us of your name and then please let us know what your thoughts are.

965
02:23:41,878 --> 02:23:43,339
[SPEAKER_17]: And you need to activate memory.

966
02:23:44,881 --> 02:23:45,241
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

967
02:23:48,171 --> 02:23:54,755
[SPEAKER_14]: The Student Advisory Committee on behalf of the Greater Student Advisory Organization would like to express approval for this resolution.

968
02:23:55,916 --> 02:24:06,582
[SPEAKER_14]: The impact of student input we believe is invaluable as a guiding beacon for those that administer policy, which is ultimately meant to service those very same students.

969
02:24:07,583 --> 02:24:15,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Conversely, those who create legislation have unique wisdom on the transformation from the dimensions of problems and evidence to that of quantifiable statutes.

970
02:24:17,362 --> 02:24:28,755
[SPEAKER_14]: As described by Machiavelli, those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plane to contemplate the nature of the mountains and of lofty places in order to contemplate the planes place themselves upon high mountains.

971
02:24:28,935 --> 02:24:29,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Furthermore,

972
02:24:30,941 --> 02:24:37,627
[SPEAKER_14]: As affirmed in Clause seven, we believe that both of these groups should serve not as the speaker through the mouse piece, but as the one who advises the speaker.

973
02:24:37,667 --> 02:24:43,712
[SPEAKER_14]: We believe that this resolution is one that will prove invaluable in the continued cooperation between the school committee and the student body.

974
02:24:44,353 --> 02:24:44,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

975
02:24:45,934 --> 02:24:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

976
02:24:48,536 --> 02:24:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ntapa and then Member Reinfeldt.

977
02:24:51,959 --> 02:24:52,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take this.

978
02:24:58,768 --> 02:24:59,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being here.

979
02:24:59,789 --> 02:25:03,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful to have four student representatives from the school council.

980
02:25:03,813 --> 02:25:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ntapa and then Member Reinfeldt.

981
02:25:09,562 --> 02:25:10,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

982
02:25:11,062 --> 02:25:12,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a few questions.

983
02:25:13,263 --> 02:25:16,864
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of, actually I'll go with some language questions first.

984
02:25:16,924 --> 02:25:21,605
[SPEAKER_09]: When you, Member Reinfeldt, when you say designate one member each season, what determines a season?

985
02:25:21,685 --> 02:25:22,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew that was going to come up.

986
02:25:24,045 --> 02:25:27,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I would actually like to ask the students what makes sense.

987
02:25:28,006 --> 02:25:30,067
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm recognizing the fact that

988
02:25:32,785 --> 02:25:36,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I had originally said semester, and then I realized we're in trimesters.

989
02:25:37,366 --> 02:25:40,026
[SPEAKER_17]: So that felt like the right, but then I realized there's a- In quarters?

990
02:25:40,527 --> 02:25:40,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

991
02:25:41,227 --> 02:25:42,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Quarters, sorry, we're in quarters.

992
02:25:42,387 --> 02:25:43,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was gonna say we're in quarters.

993
02:25:43,167 --> 02:25:47,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, elementary school is trimesters, and that's the last progress report I looked at.

994
02:25:48,788 --> 02:25:52,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I'm happy to do it by quarter, if that makes sense.

995
02:25:52,909 --> 02:26:01,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the most important thing is that there be a break in that January for any term changeover in perpetuity, but...

996
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Is quarterly correct?

997
02:26:08,961 --> 02:26:12,042
[SPEAKER_17]: My preference would be fall and spring.

998
02:26:12,182 --> 02:26:12,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I agree.

999
02:26:13,323 --> 02:26:18,025
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was going to add.

1000
02:26:18,685 --> 02:26:19,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1001
02:26:19,926 --> 02:26:20,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Half year?

1002
02:26:20,426 --> 02:26:24,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Students, half year, September to December, and then January to?

1003
02:26:24,127 --> 02:26:27,629
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just saying there's a lot of January to June.

1004
02:26:27,829 --> 02:26:29,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a lot longer than September to December.

1005
02:26:39,858 --> 02:26:43,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I mean.

1006
02:26:44,159 --> 02:26:47,861
[SPEAKER_03]: We give four people a term the opportunity, so it's up.

1007
02:26:48,061 --> 02:26:49,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you by quarters.

1008
02:26:51,802 --> 02:26:52,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I quarters.

1009
02:26:53,002 --> 02:26:53,683
[SPEAKER_09]: There's quarters.

1010
02:26:53,703 --> 02:26:54,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just do quarters.

1011
02:26:54,803 --> 02:26:56,324
[SPEAKER_09]: If it stays the same, it stays the same.

1012
02:26:56,924 --> 02:26:57,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't mean it has to change.

1013
02:27:00,705 --> 02:27:01,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Each quarter.

1014
02:27:08,534 --> 02:27:09,294
[SPEAKER_09]: season quarter.

1015
02:27:09,994 --> 02:27:24,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then obviously this is sort of like our policy on public engagement, presentations to the public where if they don't have anything or if they don't, like they're not being expected to prepare everything every, you know, by week to make sure that they have something.

1016
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:29,041
[SPEAKER_17]: But if they want, if they have a presentation to make, there is a designated place in the agenda for that to happen.

1017
02:27:29,401 --> 02:27:32,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are so, cause they're behind you right now.

1018
02:27:32,082 --> 02:27:35,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The best way for them to do that is to, I'm assuming email who?

1019
02:27:37,191 --> 02:27:44,956
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair, I believe, the chair and the superintendent is how people put resolutions on along with Lisa Joanne.

1020
02:27:48,440 --> 02:28:02,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last thing, so I guess, so I will, if there's no other questions for my colleagues, I'll motion to approve and also with the amendment of changing season to quarter and also adding, which you can sever this if you want, one alternate elected.

1021
02:28:02,613 --> 02:28:12,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the result that the school committee shall designate one member each quarter and one alternate whom the high school student council may invite to attend their meetings on a monthly basis that way.

1022
02:28:13,302 --> 02:28:15,644
[SPEAKER_09]: if someone can't make it, we're still as informed as we possibly can be.

1023
02:28:15,664 --> 02:28:17,325
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great, yeah, that's a good amendment.

1024
02:28:17,645 --> 02:28:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so motion for approval as amended, accepted by Member Reinfeldt, made by Member Ntapa, seconded by Member Olopade.

1025
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:26,750
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1026
02:28:27,591 --> 02:28:28,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1027
02:28:28,511 --> 02:28:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1028
02:28:29,892 --> 02:28:38,878
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I would like to motion that the rules of the school committee, oh, oh no, just lost it, hold on, that item 34 be updated

1029
02:28:42,541 --> 02:28:46,284
[SPEAKER_17]: It currently reads student representatives serve as non-voting members of the school committee.

1030
02:28:46,344 --> 02:28:49,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Student representatives will be encouraged to participate in school committee meetings.

1031
02:28:51,707 --> 02:28:53,008
[SPEAKER_17]: In the rules, sorry.

1032
02:28:53,028 --> 02:28:56,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't what?

1033
02:28:56,710 --> 02:28:57,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't amend the rules now?

1034
02:28:58,411 --> 02:29:00,713
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not on the agenda, but you can put it on for our next meeting.

1035
02:29:00,753 --> 02:29:03,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, it was in the resolution of be it resolved that this will be updated.

1036
02:29:04,255 --> 02:29:05,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Then can I update the policy?

1037
02:29:08,475 --> 02:29:25,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, then I will update the policy so that, so this is policy B-E-B-D, sorry, B-E-D-B to insert item six, presentations of student representatives in between report of the superintendent and presentations of the public.

1038
02:29:26,168 --> 02:29:36,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And accordingly, presentations of the public, continued business, new business, reports requested, condolences, and next meetings will all bump up a Roman numeral.

1039
02:29:37,962 --> 02:29:42,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to, I can share this on zoom if that's helpful.

1040
02:29:42,744 --> 02:29:44,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I can I can send it to the.

1041
02:29:44,105 --> 02:29:51,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, if you could just, if you could share where on the agenda would be one more time because we want to make sure it's after the Mustang minute.

1042
02:29:54,268 --> 02:30:05,053
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had, I had suggested that this go after the report of the superintendent before presentations okay public basically where it is right now.

1043
02:30:06,812 --> 02:30:07,792
[SPEAKER_17]: before new business.

1044
02:30:10,153 --> 02:30:10,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, policy.

1045
02:30:11,093 --> 02:30:14,674
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so you'll update that and put it on the next agenda for us to approve.

1046
02:30:14,874 --> 02:30:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wonderful.

1047
02:30:18,055 --> 02:30:20,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Presentations of student representatives.

1048
02:30:26,178 --> 02:30:33,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I could get away with reading it since it's in the resolution, but happy to submit it separately.

1049
02:30:35,107 --> 02:30:58,928
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no reports requested so move to, we do have one condolence members of the method school committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Richard doubt husband of Maureen doubt a Medford public school educated for over 30 years, serving as a fourth grade teacher at the Lincoln Kennedy and Roberts elementary schools, and uncle Andrew O'Brien principal of the McGlynn elementary school if we all may rise for a moment of silence please.
