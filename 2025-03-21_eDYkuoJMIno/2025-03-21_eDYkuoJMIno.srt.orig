00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,851

00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,893

47
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:22,854

48
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,975

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,021

[SPEAKER_23]: Also in favor.

56
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Very good.

57
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:44,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

58
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:46,086
[SPEAKER_20]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

59
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,846
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also in favor of Dave's Fresh Pies.

60
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:48,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

61
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:48,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Very good.

62
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:51,367

00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,668
[SPEAKER_26]: Please present yourself as being in favor.

64
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:59,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

65
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,031
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in favor.

66
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:08,618
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just briefly say that I applaud what Tufts did to restore and preserve this building.

67
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:18,346
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it could have been easily taken down and turned into a few more parking spaces at much less expense.

68
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,226
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't have to come up again.

69
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:20,868
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

70
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,749
[SPEAKER_25]: Anybody else in favor?

71
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed.

72
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Anybody in opposition to this?

73
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Anybody in opposition to this petition for zoning change?

74
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:42,012
[SPEAKER_25]: Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed and invite back up the representative of the petitioner to make his presentation.

75
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

76
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:51,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's actually not a zoning change.

77
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a petition for a special permit of the city council, which is

78
00:04:55,225 --> 00:05:01,150
[SPEAKER_10]: what is required for a restaurant or any sort of an eating place in an industrial zoning district.

79
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:09,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, the petition is, uh, as indicated, uh, CT and DJ, who are they?

80
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:15,903
[SPEAKER_10]: They're, uh, Christina, uh, Theophanis and David Jik, who are seated here.

81
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:19,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to ask them to stand at this point, just stand to be recognized.

82
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:21,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So for,

83
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:32,652
[SPEAKER_10]: More than 10 years now, they've together operated Dave's Fresh Pasta in Davis Square, and this will be operated by them as well, personally.

84
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:46,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And what they would propose to do is to put a restaurant that would serve, you know, coffee and pastries in the morning and lunch items such as sandwiches, and then in the evening be more of a full-service restaurant.

85
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:52,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some materials which I'd like to pass out.

86
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:56,928
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little background material about the operators.

87
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:00,932
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a draft of a menu.

88
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:10,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are two renderings here for the outside space, the indoor space, and a plan of the indoor area.

89
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have two sets of those which you might be able to pass.

90
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:40,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a portion of the building that Tufts recently rehabbed at the corner of Harvard Street and Boston Avenue.

91
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:55,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you move up Boston Avenue toward the main campus, there is a section of the building that's kind of a standalone section that's formerly known as the Carriage House.

92
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where the proposed resident will go.

93
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:59,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a space of about 2,400 square feet.

94
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:04,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now it's nothing more than a shell.

95
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,854
[SPEAKER_10]: We need the permission on the zoning change before it goes any further.

96
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:31,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would, if the council is agreeable to granting the requested permit, we would then be coming back before you at a later time for a common victuals license, for some outdoor seating permission, and we would be going to the

97
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,793
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Liquor Licensing Commission for a liquor license.

98
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:44,781
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know if the counselors have any questions, but I'm pleased to answer them.

99
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

100
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:46,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

101
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:51,587
[SPEAKER_19]: President De La Ruzo, what are we looking at for renovation time and grand opening?

102
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,553
[SPEAKER_10]: David, what's your, what kind of build-out time are you thinking?

103
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:06,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Why don't you come up and speak into the mic, so people can hear.

104
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,854
[SPEAKER_18]: My best guess would be about six to nine months after we get the permits.

105
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:11,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Get the permits.

106
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:12,975
[SPEAKER_18]: The permits, exactly.

107
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:14,896
[SPEAKER_19]: And what are the hours of operation?

108
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,077
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to be looking for extra hours.

109
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,378
[SPEAKER_18]: We open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

110
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably open around 7 for breakfast.

111
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't anticipate being open late, thinking about a 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock closing for dinner.

112
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,622
[SPEAKER_18]: and not open on Sundays.

113
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:34,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, Dave's is closed on Sundays, and our plan is to keep this closed on Sundays as well.

114
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:35,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

115
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:38,449
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

116
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,149
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

117
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Gick.

118
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:46,855
[SPEAKER_30]: David.

119
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:51,539
[SPEAKER_30]: With the opening of the new Dave's provided that it's approved, how many jobs is that going to create?

120
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,861
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to guess, I would guess 20 to 25 employees.

121
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,522
[SPEAKER_30]: 20 to 25 employees, full-time, part-time?

122
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:01,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, mostly full-time.

123
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:02,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Mostly full-time?

124
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:05,983
[SPEAKER_18]: At Dave's, 90% of our employees are full-time.

125
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:06,963
[SPEAKER_30]: Excellent.

126
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:13,485
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much.

127
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:14,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Caffiello.

128
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

129
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Dave and Chris for coming up here.

130
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a long-time customer of yours.

131
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:27,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I welcome you coming to this community, and I thank Tufts for doing a great job on the building.

132
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:30,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope you get it done shorter than your nine-month time.

133
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:35,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And please, next time you come, maybe bring a little chatouille tray for us to have samples.

134
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:40,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say good luck, and let's say I can't wait for you to come.

135
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:42,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say I think it's a well-deserved thing for the neighborhood.

136
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:43,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Appreciate that.

137
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:44,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

138
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:45,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Counselor.

139
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:46,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Pinto.

140
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:48,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Two quick questions.

141
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:52,188
[SPEAKER_11]: In these charts that you have, you have outside seating.

142
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:52,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

143
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:56,347
[SPEAKER_11]: You're proposing, is that going to require a separate license?

144
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:56,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

145
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:58,909
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be coming back again for that?

146
00:09:58,929 --> 00:09:59,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

147
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:09,816
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is that even though it's not public sidewalk, it's private property, a private area, my understanding is that the council still requires a separate permission on that.

148
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:15,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And is this just like an example of having four, or is that what it's going to be just for?

149
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,924
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's just a... Yeah, that's just a render.

150
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:25,392
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would all be, none of this would be on public sidewalk.

151
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:28,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It would all be within the enclosed.

152
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at the proposed plot plan, you'll see that there's a courtyard area between the main portion of the building and the, I have extra copies of those if you like.

153
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:15,466
Again, according to the plan, you'll see there's an adjacent parking lot which

154
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:41,239
[SPEAKER_10]: which Tufts is deemed to be open parking in the evening to anyone, patrons or anyone in the neighborhood.

155
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And during the daytime, there are 10 dedicated spaces that would be reserved for the restaurant.

156
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,807
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is plenty of parking along Boston Avenue as well.

157
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, your food is excellent.

158
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been there many times.

159
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,212
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just need to ask you this last question.

160
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,355
[SPEAKER_11]: On one of your pages here, you have a blueberry muffin.

161
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:06,075
[SPEAKER_11]: The best blueberry muffins came out of Jardin Marsh when they were in Boston.

162
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they as good?

163
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:09,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell the people.

164
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:11,759
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll let you judge that.

165
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully close.

166
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,061
[SPEAKER_29]: Move approval, Mr. President.

167
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Move approval, Councillor Haynes.

168
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:19,663
[SPEAKER_29]: Papers are in order, Mr. President.

169
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,925
[SPEAKER_29]: I see no reason why we should stand in the way of this gentleman opening business.

170
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,386
[SPEAKER_25]: A motion for approval by Councillor Penter.

171
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,687
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favour?

172
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:26,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

173
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,248
[SPEAKER_25]: All in favour call a vote on this.

174
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:28,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

175
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,681
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

176
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:39,593
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

177
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:41,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

178
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Five in the affirmative, none negative.

179
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,376
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion passes.

180
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

181
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:46,957
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

182
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:47,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Good luck.

183
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Move for suspension, Mr. President.

184
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:51,439
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilman Knight for suspension.

185
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,119
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

186
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:52,900
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Suspension of the rules for what purpose?

188
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Take paper 15591 out of order.

189
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,122
[SPEAKER_29]: Communications from the mayor.

190
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:00,483
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion of Councilman Knight to take 15591.

191
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:16,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Before us now, communication from the mayor to President De La Russo and members of the city council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, regarding loan order, capital improvements to city sewer system.

192
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,412
[SPEAKER_25]: City of Medford, Massachusetts loan order.

193
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:34,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it ordered that the sum of $2,120,000 be and hereby is appropriated to pay costs of making capital improvements to the city's sewer system, including the payment of all costs, incidental or related thereto,

194
00:13:35,184 --> 00:14:01,160
[SPEAKER_25]: in that to meet this appropriation, the city treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow said sum and to issue bonds or notes of the city, therefore, in the aggregate principal amount of $2,120,000, under and pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 7, Chapter 1 of Massachusetts General Laws, as amended and supplemented, or pursuant to any other enabling authority.

195
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,322
[SPEAKER_25]: The treasurer is authorized to borrow all or any portion

196
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:12,299
[SPEAKER_25]: of the amount appropriated by this order through the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority Local Financial Assistance Program.

197
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Sincerely yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor, signature on file.

198
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:31,804
[SPEAKER_25]: Before us to make a presentation, we have Louise Miller, the Director of Budget, Finance, Personnel, and Purchasing, and Cassandra Koudelikas, the Chief Engineer for the City of Medford.

199
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:32,885
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome to you both.

200
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:33,865
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

201
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:37,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Please.

202
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:42,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to turn it over to Cassandra Kadulidis to describe what the project is.

203
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:55,379
[SPEAKER_13]: And all I want to say regarding the sum of money is that this is a grant, partial grant, 45% grant, 55% loan from the MWRA.

204
00:14:55,439 --> 00:15:00,460
[SPEAKER_13]: The loan is at 0% interest, repayable over five years.

205
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,402
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I'll turn it to her to address the substance of what the work is that's going to be done.

206
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:08,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick question.

207
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:10,949
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one half.

208
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:12,850
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the percent on the remaining portion of the loan?

209
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:18,133
[SPEAKER_13]: The grant is a grant, so that would be 45%, $954,000, and the remainder is a 0% interest loan.

210
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:18,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Pardon me?

211
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:18,793
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

212
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:19,993
[SPEAKER_13]: The remainder of the $2.120 million.

213
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:20,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

214
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

215
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Cassandra Cudelitas, 29 Crystal Street, Melrose.

216
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:52,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Before you is an application that we submitted to the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority to participate in their grant loan program for the removal of inflow and infiltration from the city's sewer systems.

217
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:57,449
[SPEAKER_14]: The project, there are five projects.

218
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,150
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them is quite small.

219
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,792
[SPEAKER_14]: It just allows us to hire an engineering summer intern for two years.

220
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:06,744
[SPEAKER_14]: at approximately $8,000 per year.

221
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll go over.

222
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:11,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll spend most of the time on the four projects that we have listed.

223
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,712
[SPEAKER_14]: The first three are located in North Medford or Medford Heights.

224
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:21,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first one in that three is for ongoing sewer system rehabilitation.

225
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:28,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have issued a contract using unit prices and quantities.

226
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:39,975
[SPEAKER_14]: We put it out on the street, D'Alessandro Corporation bid on it, and we funded their first year of work, to which they've done about $200,000 worth of work already.

227
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:45,258
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're asking for is for funding for years two and three.

228
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:58,107
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's continuing for them to go on and rehabilitate manholes, replace sewer pipe, line sewers, take care of spot repairs, anything and everything that we need that can remove

229
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:00,965
[SPEAKER_14]: or inflow and infiltration.

230
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:20,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to back up, the INI was identified in a study that was done first by Wright Pierce, published in 2011, in which they estimated about 2.5 million gallons per day is flowing due to some form of groundwater or inflow from stormwater events.

231
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're tackling that where we're not going to be able to get rid of every last gallon.

232
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:34,290
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cost effective to do so, but we're following DEP guidelines, which is to pursue about 50% of the I&I.

233
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:45,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So this project is the first one, and we're doing good work in accomplishing removal of this kind of water from our system, which is a savings to the rate payers.

234
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Vice President.

235
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:49,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

236
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:51,274
[SPEAKER_19]: A question on that, Cassandra.

237
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,914
[SPEAKER_19]: You mentioned, did you mention the area on project number two?

238
00:17:55,154 --> 00:18:05,079
[SPEAKER_14]: North Medford, so Medford Heights, bounded by Highland Avenue and 28, Route 28, primarily, and the Malden Line, and then 28 heading north.

239
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,544
[SPEAKER_19]: So about how much was the distance in pipes that will be able to be replaced?

240
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:14,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have, let me see.

241
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:21,368
[SPEAKER_14]: this contract.

242
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:31,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So this contract with Della Sandorna, this is just, we did a phase one limited sanitary sewer evaluation survey.

243
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:37,013
[SPEAKER_14]: We knew we needed to follow on and do another one, which is part of this package that we're applying for.

244
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:47,116
[SPEAKER_14]: But within the phase one, we are, for example, lining about 1,300 linear feet of sewer pipe at eight inch diameter.

245
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,577
[SPEAKER_14]: We're lining 12 inch diameter pipe at 400 linear feet.

246
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,673
[SPEAKER_14]: We're dealing with 20 sewer service connections that need to be replaced.

247
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:01,198
[SPEAKER_14]: We are doing spot repair for about 700 linear feet.

248
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,241
[SPEAKER_14]: We have manhole rehabilitation and manhole replacement.

249
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:10,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a roster of about 40 different payment items that are covered in this contract.

250
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:12,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a point of information, Mr. President.

251
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:19,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any way that we can get a copy of this so you're not reading it, so we have this information ahead of time?

252
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We never got any of this.

253
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,856
[SPEAKER_11]: And two members of the council aren't even here tonight.

254
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:29,519
[SPEAKER_11]: You're asking for $2 million, and you're reading to us what we're supposed to be understanding now.

255
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it would be more appropriate if we had copies of this to understand it.

256
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:39,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is a lot to digest for you selling this, so, you know.

257
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:44,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and I'm not intending you to take notes as I speak.

258
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,606
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an example of what it is that we're working on.

259
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,488
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would be interesting for us to know what we're going to be voting on.

260
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,688
[SPEAKER_11]: and have all the information.

261
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,469
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the information there.

262
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,570
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have it here.

263
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,271
[SPEAKER_14]: So would you like me to have a photocopy made of this?

264
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have copies of whatever you're talking about made available.

265
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're having copied is a payment request from D'Alessandro.

266
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:16,359
[SPEAKER_14]: It's their second payment request, which lists all the pay items for the work that they're doing and their prices.

267
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,941
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to move on while that is being prepared.

268
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,695
[SPEAKER_14]: to continue talking about North Medford.

269
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:30,561
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first part, once again, is to continue funding our sewer rehabilitation contract and its contractor.

270
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:36,306
[SPEAKER_14]: The second part is to disconnect some of the catch basins that are tied to the sewer system.

271
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:47,455
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a study that indicated about nine catch basins are currently connected to the sanitary sewer system, of which three of them are the most cost effective for removal.

272
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,391
[SPEAKER_14]: three locations, six catch bases.

273
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:56,075
[SPEAKER_14]: That's documented in the application and the areas of which they're located is documented in the application.

274
00:20:56,935 --> 00:21:04,920
[SPEAKER_14]: What we would ask to do is that we could go forward with final design and bid documents and start work this fall to disconnect those catch bases.

275
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:13,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The third part of the work that would be happening in North Medford is to do the phase two study that I just mentioned.

276
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:27,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So the phase one limited study came up with roughly 2.5 million gallons per day of water that is in the system that shouldn't be due to groundwater, all kinds of other inflow and infiltration.

277
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, we're not going to be able to get all of it out, but we can get a good portion of it.

278
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:37,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Second phase is to go back in and study more closely areas that were not studied.

279
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,312
[SPEAKER_14]: and to do things like night flow isolation.

280
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:44,294
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's when the sewer system is running at its least.

281
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,056
[SPEAKER_14]: No one's really using water in the dead of night.

282
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:52,559
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to track the source of the infiltration so we could better target the repair work.

283
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,723
[SPEAKER_14]: The repair work can be done with Della Sandra, our current contractor, or we can issue another contract down the road.

284
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,214
[SPEAKER_11]: They're talking to us for the first time about a $2 million project.

285
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:15,257
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just hearing about this, trying to understand it while you're talking.

286
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:28,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And with two members not being here, Mr. President, I just respectfully suggest that we just lay this on the table until we can get our information at hand for the purposes of understanding it.

287
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,305
[SPEAKER_11]: When was the grant applied for?

288
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:35,667
[SPEAKER_14]: When we applied for other grants in the past, such as water work, there was no more.

289
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:40,084
[SPEAKER_14]: in the package for the application than what you're getting here tonight for the sewer system work.

290
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,126
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're talking about what you're going to do.

291
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:43,727
[SPEAKER_14]: That same thing, the other projects.

292
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:45,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and you're asking us to vote on this.

293
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Which we have done in the past for the other two MWRA bills.

294
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,012
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're asking us to vote on it tonight.

295
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,774
[SPEAKER_11]: You've seen it, you've worked on it, and you know what it's about.

296
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:54,956
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, through the chair.

297
00:22:55,896 --> 00:23:00,440
[SPEAKER_25]: I think first, if we could allow Miss Miller wanted to address us briefly.

298
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, if I could.

299
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,764
[SPEAKER_13]: So the application was just filed this past Friday.

300
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:18,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And in order to be reviewed by the MWRA, we must present to them all documents by before August 20th, which is when they meet.

301
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:26,810
[SPEAKER_13]: If we do not make the August 20th deadline, we will not receive funding for any work to be completed in this calendar year.

302
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,292
[SPEAKER_13]: The next round of applications will then be looked at three months later.

303
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:35,148
[SPEAKER_11]: which is November.

304
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,308
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll finish Louise.

305
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,909
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a meeting I think is August 11th.

306
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:38,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

307
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

308
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,031
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can lay this on the table, discuss it.

309
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And when August 11th comes, the council can vote on it.

310
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,954
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because this is a loan order.

311
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:49,676
[SPEAKER_13]: We require, as I understand it, three readings.

312
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And so tonight would have, would be the first reading.

313
00:23:52,278 --> 00:24:01,023
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could advertise it, that would constitute the second reading that would make the August 11th meeting your third reading so that we could have all the documents in place.

314
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,842
[SPEAKER_13]: for the MWRA by their August 20th meeting.

315
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:08,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any reason why we had to wait this long?

316
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:11,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We just submitted the application this past Friday.

317
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:12,509
[SPEAKER_11]: This past Friday?

318
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:12,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

319
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:17,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want us to vote on it tonight because it has to take three readings before August 20th.

320
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:18,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're saying?

321
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:19,815
[SPEAKER_13]: That is what I'm saying, yes.

322
00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:23,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have over $7.5 million in a surplus money in our water and sewer account.

323
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:26,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I have that.

324
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:28,303
[SPEAKER_11]: For which we wouldn't have to pay any interest on.

325
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,429
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no interest under this loan.

326
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:35,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we rushing into this?

327
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,794
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to continue working on the projects that we talked about.

328
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:45,217
[SPEAKER_14]: So Della Sandra's contract for a year two starts in August 2015.

329
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:50,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

330
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

331
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,022
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess for Ms.

332
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:58,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Miller, can we take the one point

333
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:06,650
[SPEAKER_19]: $1 million out of our surplus to cover the city's portion on this project rather than go out to bond on it?

334
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:26,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we could, but there doesn't seem to be any reason to reduce the amount of the retained earnings if we can get a loan, have it at 0% interest, and maintain the retained earnings at the level that they are.

335
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:29,656
[SPEAKER_13]: in the sewer enterprise fund.

336
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:39,501
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no advantage to the city to do that.

337
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:47,465
[SPEAKER_19]: My last question is, I guess, from what I'm understanding, because I have the same kind of concern with regards to what we were given on Friday.

338
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:54,468
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a request for the 2.1 million, and I'm struggling to take notes on the five different projects that's

339
00:25:56,266 --> 00:26:01,510
[SPEAKER_19]: that the $2 million is going to go towards, it would have been nice to have had something in writing describing the projects.

340
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,471
[SPEAKER_14]: But the $5 million projects are in that application.

341
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:04,992
[SPEAKER_14]: The five projects are in there.

342
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they don't have this document.

343
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:07,374
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have this document?

344
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:08,595
[SPEAKER_19]: I never got it.

345
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:13,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think they have that.

346
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,979
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't get an application.

347
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:22,325
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just a large amount of money to vote on with no information before me.

348
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:26,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if my colleague... No.

349
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you get anything?

350
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:32,872
[SPEAKER_30]: I met with him beforehand to talk about this.

351
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:39,297
[SPEAKER_19]: To say that, you know, we don't need to take notes, I just think that's a disservice to us and the taxpayer.

352
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:52,107
[SPEAKER_19]: When I get a call tomorrow asking me from a concerned resident what I just voted on, and I have to say, oh, you know, my notes from last night, I mean, I should have been able to read something and be prepared to take a $2 million vote.

353
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:56,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kind of... No, that's not what I meant, that you don't have to take notes.

354
00:26:56,433 --> 00:27:00,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you had this document in front of you, and that you'd have read it already.

355
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:05,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, I don't have any document to describe the $2 million.

356
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:09,196
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I don't necessarily want to table this right now.

357
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:14,578
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to hear more, but I guess I'm just frustrated having to make a vote.

358
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:19,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, obviously, we need the three readings, and you have this application, and it's a good 0% interest.

359
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,700
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a grant, so it's just a lot to take in.

360
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:23,777
[SPEAKER_19]: at this moment.

361
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:31,162
[SPEAKER_19]: If you could just continue then so we can better understand the five projects.

362
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:40,049
[SPEAKER_31]: The way that I understand this and the way that I see this presented is we have a bond order in front of us for $2.12 million.

363
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:47,194
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to get paid back 45 cents on every dollar that we invest and the bond that we're taking out on the other 55% is at 0%.

364
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,397
[SPEAKER_31]: So actually, we're taking out a bond for

365
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:55,409
[SPEAKER_31]: 1, 2 million, we're getting paid back almost half of that.

366
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,451
[SPEAKER_31]: And then over a five-year period of time, we get to pay back the bond at a 0% interest rate.

367
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,472
[SPEAKER_32]: That's correct.

368
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:07,115
[SPEAKER_31]: And then the projects that we're working on here are to address system upgrades for our water and sewer system.

369
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,737
[SPEAKER_31]: And part of that includes infiltration and inflow as a phase two project.

370
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, that's correct.

371
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:19,961
[SPEAKER_14]: These capital reinvestment in our sanitary sewer system of which we can easily spend tens of millions of dollars

372
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:23,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's starting a process.

373
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:31,201
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a total of $3.16 million available to us under this particular program.

374
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:36,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they move on to a new program, which is a 75% grant, 25% loan.

375
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:45,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So as we go forward with projects that we can make these improvements, we're eligible for more grant money or a larger piece of grant money.

376
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:49,330
[SPEAKER_31]: So in essence, if we support this paper, what we can do is we can

377
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:59,919
[SPEAKER_31]: borrow 2.12 million bucks, get 45% of that money back, and then pay 0% interest on the money that's remaining over a five-year period?

378
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,140
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

379
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,220
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much.

380
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:03,021
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

381
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:06,523
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that you guys are doing a good job.

382
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:13,308
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, there's not too many places where you're going to get 45% back on every dollar that you invest, 45 cents on every dollar back that you invest.

383
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:14,949
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

384
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:15,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

385
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Caffiello?

386
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:18,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

387
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:26,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you say that we're gonna be doing manual covers and sewers repair?

388
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:30,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, just manhole, rebuilding manholes, new manholes, covers.

389
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:32,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of them are all sinking throughout the whole city.

390
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

391
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with the sewers.

392
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:34,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Sewer manholes.

393
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:35,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what phase of the project would that be in?

394
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:38,075
[SPEAKER_14]: It's throughout the three phases.

395
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:40,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the three phases.

396
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:40,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

397
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:44,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with Councilor Knight, we're getting half the money back and borrowing at 0%.

398
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes good fiscal sense and I don't have any problem voting

399
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,800
[SPEAKER_09]: on the first reading this evening.

400
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:55,023
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you want to continue with a point?

401
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:56,143
[SPEAKER_31]: Councillor Knight.

402
00:29:56,944 --> 00:30:08,148
[SPEAKER_31]: In terms of I&I and what the studies say, what exactly is, in a dollar figure, if you can, off the top of your head, what's the city actually spend on I&I issues here in the city of Medford?

403
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:14,131
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, if we're looking at 2.5 million gallons per day, is that what I understood you say?

404
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:16,750
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the flow meters are.

405
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,092
[SPEAKER_14]: They put meters in certain manholes, and they measure the flow.

406
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:21,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And they calculate that out.

407
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,854
[SPEAKER_14]: They extrapolate it.

408
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:28,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And they estimate that there's about 2.5 million gallons per day of additional water there.

409
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,559
[SPEAKER_31]: What would that translate to in terms of cost on a sewer?

410
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:32,600
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you have any idea?

411
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,721
[SPEAKER_29]: Just the implications.

412
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Ms.

413
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:39,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Koulides and I were trying to figure that out.

414
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:44,367
[SPEAKER_13]: The total sewer charges are based upon percentages

415
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:52,645
[SPEAKER_13]: not just sewer flow, so it's not like water, where water, it's consumption, and you would get charged a rate for a particular number of gallons.

416
00:30:53,245 --> 00:31:01,052
[SPEAKER_13]: But 13.3% of the total allocation of sewer is based up on the maximum wastewater flow.

417
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:11,881
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we can reduce the maximum wastewater flow, we're reducing the allocation of the overall sewer cost to the city of Medford.

418
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:17,132
[SPEAKER_13]: large part is 25% is average wastewater flow.

419
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:23,480
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we can also reduce the average wastewater flow, we're reducing the overall allocation to Medford.

420
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,570
[SPEAKER_13]: So the way the sewer rates work is MWRA works out the total number and then allocates it among the communities using a weighted formula.

421
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:38,304
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can try to work on a better number for your next meeting.

422
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,605
[SPEAKER_13]: And speak with MWRA so that we can try to get a better number.

423
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:44,546
[SPEAKER_13]: But we couldn't ourselves work out what that number would be.

424
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:50,728
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to see what exactly is this investment that we're making of about a million dollars is actually going to save the rate payers on the back end.

425
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:56,790
[SPEAKER_31]: And it looks like it's going to be exponential if we're losing 2.5 million gallons per day through I&I.

426
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,511
[SPEAKER_31]: It looks like this is really an investment that's going to show us a return.

427
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:02,712
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure.

428
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:03,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

429
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:06,098
[SPEAKER_24]: I know a couple citizens want to address us.

430
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:06,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

431
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Martin was waiting patiently.

432
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,699
[SPEAKER_25]: We invite her up first.

433
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:14,642
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

434
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

435
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

436
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:23,706
[SPEAKER_07]: While on the face of it, this project seems to be a needed improvement to the city of Medford.

437
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:27,408
[SPEAKER_07]: What concerns me is the expediency at which this project is presented.

438
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,691
[SPEAKER_07]: No information has been presented to the community.

439
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,492
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really know which streets need to be digged up.

440
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:39,114
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know necessarily, maybe more improvements would be necessary, maybe less.

441
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:47,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Without having adequate information presented to the public and to the council in advance, I would urge you to delay this issue.

442
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:53,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that this issue needs to be brought up in some haste, but perhaps a committee of the whole meeting could be held

443
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:56,522
[SPEAKER_07]: where this issue could be reviewed in more detail.

444
00:32:56,923 --> 00:33:05,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, this action represents a pattern of behavior by the city administration.

445
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do it quick.

446
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really need to know.

447
00:33:09,185 --> 00:33:10,285
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council doesn't need to know.

448
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: The public doesn't need to know.

449
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:13,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll rubber stamp it.

450
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, do not use your vote as a rubber stamp.

451
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Take time to consider $2.1 million.

452
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,588
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of funding for this city.

453
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't rush the proposition.

454
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

455
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

456
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Please state your name and address for the record.

457
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:28,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

458
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale street.

459
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:41,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, just a quick side note, the water enterprise fund, water and sewer enterprise fund was established for emergencies in the cities and to take care of old, old pipes and so on and so forth.

460
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:50,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, when that created was created, the recommended funding for level funding level for that was between two and $2.5 million.

461
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:50,545
[SPEAKER_20]: That meant that

462
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:59,766
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd have a substantial amount of money to take care of any and mostly all emergencies that had to do with water and sewer.

463
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:04,216
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we have, I believe it's over $6 million in there.

464
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,258
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't see the reason we need to take out a loan.

465
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,862
[SPEAKER_20]: And as far as not paying any interest on it, the loan becomes part of our debt service.

466
00:34:11,143 --> 00:34:14,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Now who pays the debt service in the city is the taxpayers.

467
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:22,874
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's invisible when you put it on paper, but at the back end, it's the citizens who are paying increases in taxes to pay for this loan.

468
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:24,415
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got the money there.

469
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:26,597
[SPEAKER_20]: All you have to do is take it out of there.

470
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:28,298
[SPEAKER_20]: towards the project.

471
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,840
[SPEAKER_20]: The project is sorely needed, there's no doubt about it.

472
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,343
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can't see why we're not using the Water Enterprise Fund because that was the sole purpose that this was created for.

473
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:38,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

474
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:44,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, John Cerullo, 20 Metcalf Street.

475
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:45,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President and councillors,

476
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,142
[SPEAKER_03]: The Water and Sewer Commission probably anticipated this, as they should have.

477
00:34:55,222 --> 00:35:00,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That is their job, and that's the reason that the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund was set up.

478
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:07,667
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they do is, on the advice, I assume, of the engineer, they decide this has to be done.

479
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:11,909
[SPEAKER_03]: They find out what it is, and they put that into their rates.

480
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why our rates are what they are, because they're supposed to pay for this as it comes along.

481
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to quote to you from the state law.

482
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: This is chapter 41, section 69B, and it says here, if in any fiscal year there should be a net surplus, which is what we have, we have a surplus, remaining after providing for the four set charges, in other words, all the normal charges that the Water and Sewer Commission has,

483
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:59,986
[SPEAKER_03]: If there should be such a surplus, any such reimbursement in full, such surplus may be appropriated for such new construction, extraordinary maintenance, or repairs.

484
00:36:00,306 --> 00:36:01,607
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this is, repairs.

485
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:11,032
[SPEAKER_03]: As the water commission or selectmen authorized to act as such, with the approval of the town may determine upon.

486
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:20,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And in case a net surplus should remain after payment of such new construction, extraordinary maintenance or repairs, the water rates shall be reduced.

487
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,131
[SPEAKER_03]: The water rates should be reduced because we have a surplus.

488
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And here it is right in the law.

489
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city is not following the law.

490
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:40,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Said commissioners, all the selectmen authorized to act as such shall annually, as often as the town may require, render a report

491
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:51,001
[SPEAKER_03]: upon the condition of the works under their charge and an amount of their doings and an account of their doings, including an account of the receipts and expenditures.

492
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that the council gets this annual report from the Water and Sewer Commission, but here it is in the law.

493
00:36:56,803 --> 00:37:02,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this Water and Sewer Department is notorious for their past activities.

494
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been investigated.

495
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:21,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you who've been here on the council previously may remember they've been investigated by an independent commission and that department was found lacking in many areas and it was an embarrassment to the city.

496
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:25,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

497
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:29,388
[SPEAKER_25]: Having had time now to look at some of these notes that were passed to the council,

498
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,473
[SPEAKER_25]: Do any councillors have any further questions for either the engineer or the budget director?

499
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:55,522
[SPEAKER_25]: I may point out that this is the first step in a process that will take a couple weeks, and so we'll have ample time to conduct any investigations we need to for the benefit of our knowledge when making our deliberations on the final decision of this question.

500
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:56,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Penta.

501
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:02,426
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for a copy of what you applied for.

502
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,229
[SPEAKER_11]: You gave us something dated September 16, 2014.

503
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:19,582
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a copy of the price sheet for the contractor who is the sewer system rehabilitation contractor.

504
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:20,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is the application?

505
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:21,644
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for a copy of the application.

506
00:38:30,484 --> 00:38:34,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, may I address two comments?

507
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want clarification on the debt service.

508
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:41,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's a 0% interest loan, there is no debt service.

509
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:43,168
[SPEAKER_13]: It will not appear as debt service.

510
00:38:43,648 --> 00:38:45,429
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's no burden on the taxpayer?

511
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:51,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it has to be paid, but it is not debt service.

512
00:38:52,932 --> 00:39:00,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the second item is I do have a preliminary report.

513
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:03,374
[SPEAKER_13]: on the water and sewer budgets this year.

514
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:15,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you recall, there were tiered rates that were implemented this year, so that the amount of billings is actually less than the expenses for each of those budgets.

515
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:21,661
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will be probably using retained earnings to balance the budget.

516
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:24,062
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the date on that?

517
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:24,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Today.

518
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,042
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's ending June 30th?

519
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:27,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that is for the fiscal year.

520
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:30,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get a copy of that also?

521
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, as soon as it's finalized.

522
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:40,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is part of the report that I told you I would be bringing you regarding the water and sewer rates and where we were with the water and sewer enterprise fund budgets.

523
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Louise, this is important information.

524
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be nice to get that ahead of time so we could review it.

525
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:51,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

526
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:52,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President.

527
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:53,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

528
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:58,123
[SPEAKER_19]: On that issue, what are we looking at for the shortfall?

529
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:14,282
[SPEAKER_13]: So the difference between billings versus expenses, the billings for sewer would be $12,227,527 with expenses of $13,200,000.

530
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a million dollar difference between what was billed versus expenses.

531
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:17,343
[SPEAKER_13]: However, because we don't

532
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:29,793
[SPEAKER_13]: collect money exactly from July 1 to June 30.

533
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:37,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the collections for fiscal 14 are being accrued in fiscal 15.

534
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:42,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now we're projecting a shortfall in sewer of approximately $734,000.

535
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:44,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Now water, the shortfall between

536
00:40:51,829 --> 00:41:08,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Billings and expenditures is $314,977, but because of the way the collection of the rates and the invoices occurs, we're actually okay this year and have a surplus of $50,000.

537
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:18,550
[SPEAKER_13]: However, going forward, because we're billing at such a shortfall, we're going to be carrying over a billing shortfall into fiscal year 16.

538
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:22,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, this is, again, just the preliminary stuff.

539
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:25,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to have some information here in case you had questions regarding that.

540
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:26,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I just got that today.

541
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:30,308
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't completely closed our fiscal year 15 books yet.

542
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:33,930
[SPEAKER_19]: So approximately, you're estimating about $684,000 shortfall for 2014?

543
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Fiscal 15.

544
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Fiscal.

545
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,131
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

546
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:35,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Fiscal.

547
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:35,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

548
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, with regards to the projects that, I think we're on

549
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,890
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been explained 1, 2, and part of 3.

550
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:53,671
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 4, 5 to go.

551
00:41:53,691 --> 00:42:03,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the application from September that was just handed out to us, is there anything in writing that would further describe these five projects?

552
00:42:03,276 --> 00:42:05,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Which streets are going to be re-piped?

553
00:42:05,097 --> 00:42:09,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Which manholes are going to be worked on?

554
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,183
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear the Fulton Heights, but where actually these repairs are going to go?

555
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:21,956
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a few locations where the work is specified, such as Gaston Street, for example.

556
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:26,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Sewer lining has been done last year.

557
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:28,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Locations such as Grant Avenue were taken care of.

558
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:38,100
[SPEAKER_14]: The specifications in the bid documents were not so much site-specific as item-specific.

559
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,662
[SPEAKER_14]: So we know that there are more degraded manholes than are in this contract, and it's designed to get started repairing them.

560
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:53,134
[SPEAKER_14]: The studies that would be done in the catch basin, I was talking to you about moving some of the catch basins that are connected to sewer systems.

561
00:42:53,194 --> 00:43:04,440
[SPEAKER_14]: We have specific locations for them, and we have preliminary layouts for what the drain piping would look like to take the basin off the sanitary sewer system and to route it to a storm drain system.

562
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:05,941
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's been looked at.

563
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:11,785
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I was talking about a follow-on study, which once again would go out in specific areas.

564
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:28,131
[SPEAKER_14]: what they call catchment areas, they're alphabetized, area P, area M, and they get broken down into M1, M2, M3, and they focus on the ones that seem to be the most egregious, and that's a scope of work that's prepared to us by our consultant.

565
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:38,235
[SPEAKER_14]: They say we want to go to, say, for example, M3 and do some night flow isolations because we think that there might be a brook that is infiltrating into the sewer.

566
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:41,496
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to see, you know, through dye testing, they put dye in the water.

567
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,393
[SPEAKER_14]: and they track it to see where it goes.

568
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:53,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's, as I mentioned, more to do than we have money for at this point in time, so that we'll never run out of any spots.

569
00:43:53,456 --> 00:44:01,859
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have, I'd say, 50% target locations, certain vented manhole covers we want to change out.

570
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:07,841
[SPEAKER_14]: The high school has a problem that we are working on with some of the drainage tying, you know,

571
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:11,020
[SPEAKER_14]: getting into the sanitary system.

572
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:21,609
[SPEAKER_19]: With regards to the consultant you had mentioned that goes out and categorizes, is that something that's already been done or is that something that's going to be paid for with the $2 million?

573
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:22,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Both.

574
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the work has been already done.

575
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:25,692
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a loan.

576
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:29,315
[SPEAKER_14]: We were living off a loan that was applied for and granted back in 2002.

577
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:35,106
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the last time the city has gone for this type of money.

578
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:39,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there was some funds remaining that have been spent down to do some of this work.

579
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:45,157
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my first I&I application in the eight years that I've been here.

580
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:48,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I've come before this body twice on the water side.

581
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:52,525
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be coming again to you in the fall to talk about water projects.

582
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:55,917
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the first one that's addressing sewer to this extent.

583
00:44:55,977 --> 00:45:02,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to let you know, more globally, we are under an administrative order from the EPA, as I mentioned before.

584
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:16,088
[SPEAKER_14]: There are sanitary sewer overflows in both the Heights and in this other system, which is project number four, called system P. And we need to address those per EPA.

585
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:22,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Heights was picked because that has three sanitary sewer overflows.

586
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:32,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And system P, which has an overflow on Daly Road, that's the low point where all the water drains to, that has SSO problems in the past.

587
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:37,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're familiar with the Winthrop Street drain project that was going on for what seemed like forever?

588
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:48,058
[SPEAKER_14]: That was intended to take some water out of the system and route it to the storm drains instead of ending up in the sewer as it sometimes did because catch basins would overflow.

589
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would go through these manholes that are not solid anymore.

590
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:58,187
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there are cracks and leaks in the top frames and covers, and it would get into the sanitary sewer system.

591
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:13,238
[SPEAKER_19]: So from the consultant that has already done some work, we have a list out there of which sewers, what work we need to do?

592
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:13,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

593
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,540
[SPEAKER_14]: They did something called smoke testing.

594
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:19,331
[SPEAKER_14]: So they pump smoke into the system, and they look to see where it comes up.

595
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:25,376
[SPEAKER_14]: If it comes up in anybody's downspout or comes up through the grass, that tells us there's a problem area, so they write all that down.

596
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:27,378
[SPEAKER_14]: They found sump pumps.

597
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,300
[SPEAKER_14]: People pump their sumps into the sanitary sewer.

598
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,521
[SPEAKER_14]: They know where some of those are.

599
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:33,323
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to look at a program.

600
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:43,092
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't done anything yet with sump pumps, but we want to look at a program to address that with the residents in a way that's not punitive to the residents who are tied into it.

601
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:53,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have specific locations, but we're also writing this spec and this rehab contract to be open enough that if a sewer collapses somewhere, we can send them out to do it.

602
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:57,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not stuck saying, only going to do these five streets and nothing else.

603
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:03,636
[SPEAKER_14]: It gives us the ability to have something like a house doctor for sanitary sewer work.

604
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,642
[SPEAKER_19]: So from that,

605
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:17,104
[SPEAKER_19]: the first consultant, I guess, what does the list look like?

606
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:23,452
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, how many catch basins need to be fixed?

607
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:29,260
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, what type of list are we looking at for, I'm assuming M3 is the worst, being the worst?

608
00:47:29,678 --> 00:47:34,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I gave you M3 as an example of a location where they would go to.

609
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:41,085
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a report, and the report has categorized the work as immediate corrective action.

610
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:50,829
[SPEAKER_14]: On its condition, how fragile a pipe is, how many cracks are in the pipe, so those are immediate corrective actions.

611
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:54,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Then it drops down to priority one and then priority two.

612
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:59,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd be happy to share the findings from the report that were done in 2011 and 2014 so that you know where they have listed

613
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:13,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have appendices and maps and shading, a lot of extensive background to the reports as documentation for what they did.

614
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:23,363
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're rounding it all up to this level so that we can say, we will assign the contractor to do these specific things.

615
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:25,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've done the $200,000 worth of work last year.

616
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:35,305
[SPEAKER_14]: 400 something thousand they can do this year and another 500 something thousand they can do the next year.

617
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:44,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're going to study and more pinpoint more of the immediate corrective action items that we need to do so we're not spending money on lower priority work.

618
00:48:45,347 --> 00:48:48,667
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going from the worst to the least worse, the least bad.

619
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:55,469
[SPEAKER_24]: It's standard.

620
00:48:58,417 --> 00:48:59,558
[SPEAKER_14]: It's generally standard work.

621
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:05,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Just, I don't know if you're going to continue with the rest of the projects.

622
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:13,105
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we were only on number three of five, so I would just ask that that be completed before you take a vote.

623
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:13,885
[SPEAKER_25]: Project four.

624
00:49:13,905 --> 00:49:16,887
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't understand what was your request, ma'am?

625
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:20,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Vice President?

626
00:49:20,568 --> 00:49:25,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Our city engineer was explaining the five projects that would be covered by the $2 million, so I'm just asking.

627
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,152
[SPEAKER_19]: We were on, I believe, number three.

628
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,534
[SPEAKER_19]: I still don't have a clear picture of where the $2 million will be spent.

629
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:46,065
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I could request to the chair that a written breakdown be provided to the council, you know, if and when this takes its first reading, that we get that before the third reading.

630
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:48,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Perfect.

631
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,389
[SPEAKER_25]: That's something we can get right away, yes?

632
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can get that right away.

633
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:54,012
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

634
00:49:55,892 --> 00:50:08,078
[SPEAKER_14]: So project four, so projects one, two, and three, all in North Medford, Medford Heights, connected to the three sanitary sewer overflows connected to our administrative order.

635
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:16,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Project four is called System P. System P is bounded by the Fells, Mystic Valley Parkway,

636
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:21,999
[SPEAKER_14]: It includes Winthrop Street, High Street, the area of Lawrence Estates.

637
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:26,963
[SPEAKER_14]: All of that water flows toward the pipe in Daly Road that discharges to the MWRA.

638
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:43,477
[SPEAKER_14]: That project involves a follow-on study, so a phase two study, just like North Medford, phase two study, and preparation of bid documents for a contract that can go out to take care of the immediate corrective action

639
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:48,336
[SPEAKER_14]: and the priority one projects that were identified in their phase one report.

640
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:53,759
[SPEAKER_14]: They had a phase one report that they did and gave to us in 2014.

641
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:58,761
[SPEAKER_14]: We paid for that money that was left over from previous borrowing for INI work.

642
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:12,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Did that have anything to do with the stormwater project that was just paved over involving Winthrop Street and Mystic Valley Parkway to the Mystic River?

643
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:21,087
[SPEAKER_14]: They are related because when you had that flood, water got into the sewer system through every available crowds that it could.

644
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:27,069
[SPEAKER_14]: And there were backups in people's homes that were sewer related, not just storm water related.

645
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:33,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to stress that that's managing storm water primarily.

646
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:34,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't really handle sewer.

647
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:39,334
[SPEAKER_14]: We have separate systems, at least in theory, not always in practice.

648
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:42,776
[SPEAKER_26]: But what you're presenting tonight is sewer related.

649
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:43,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Sewer related, yes.

650
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:47,639
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there a final point that you need to make?

651
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Project five.

652
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:55,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Project five I started out my presentation with is the engineering intern.

653
00:51:56,064 --> 00:52:01,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So the authority will allow us to have a student summer intern to help with this work.

654
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:05,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are estimating $8,000 per season.

655
00:52:08,153 --> 00:52:10,134
[SPEAKER_14]: for two years, so $16,000 total.

656
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:24,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And it allows, we've had Tufts University students who have come and helped us, they've learned valuable construction resident inspection experience that helped us with design projects.

657
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:32,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Through the chair, how many students per, is it just for the summer or is it for the whole year?

658
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:36,585
[SPEAKER_14]: This is summer, and it would be one student per year.

659
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:40,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's 15 weeks at 35 hours a week.

660
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:49,010
[SPEAKER_14]: At the going rate for a civil engineering mid-progress student, it's about $15 an hour.

661
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:54,052
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a slight roundup from that number.

662
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:08,802
[SPEAKER_25]: Chair awaits a motion.

663
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:10,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

664
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

665
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:19,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Cassandra, where on here am I looking at the amount of manholes that are going to be repaired?

666
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:24,484
[SPEAKER_14]: If you look at item

667
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:36,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 19, 20, 21, 22 on this chart.

668
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:37,161
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a spreadsheet.

669
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:39,583
[SPEAKER_14]: It says estimate number one on the top of the page.

670
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Citywide sewer system improvements.

671
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:46,508
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a column on the left hand side with item numbers.

672
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:49,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So what was that number again?

673
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:53,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting with 19 and going through 22.

674
00:53:56,553 --> 00:53:59,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So in this contract, there are 13.

675
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So only 13 are going to get fixed?

676
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,376
[SPEAKER_14]: 13 of this kind of rehab removal.

677
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:08,598
[SPEAKER_14]: And 10 new manholes.

678
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see, what else do they have here?

679
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:17,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about it for this contract.

680
00:54:19,602 --> 00:54:22,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So which 19 are going to get done?

681
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:24,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Will we know that when you bring us the next paper?

682
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:27,593
[SPEAKER_14]: which specific manholes?

683
00:54:27,713 --> 00:54:29,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, almost every one in the city needs to be done.

684
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:30,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

685
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:31,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're all sinking.

686
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:36,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And not everyone in the city is a sewer manhole, and not everyone in the city belongs to us.

687
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:37,516
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other people.

688
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:38,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, there are other people.

689
00:54:38,396 --> 00:54:40,097
[SPEAKER_14]: MWRA and other people have manholes, but.

690
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:44,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we take an inventory and let the MWRA come down and start fixing the ones?

691
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,920
[SPEAKER_14]: We do, and we also have in-house capability for manhole repairs as well.

692
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,822
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are jobs that are bigger than what the highway department can handle, because they're responsible for doing the simple fixes.

693
00:54:55,438 --> 00:54:58,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the highway department, they can only do so much work.

694
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:02,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, their tax, their manpower is taxed to the hill right now.

695
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:09,241
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Knight.

696
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:11,382
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I'm satisfied with the presentation.

697
00:55:11,422 --> 00:55:12,722
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd ask for a move for approval on the paper.

698
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:15,323
[SPEAKER_24]: A motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

699
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,383
[SPEAKER_24]: Second that, Mr. President.

700
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:18,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councilor Caviello.

701
00:55:19,204 --> 00:55:20,244
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor.

702
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:20,944
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may.

703
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

704
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:23,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

705
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:28,469
[SPEAKER_19]: I would ask for obviously more information for the third reading.

706
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:35,771
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also think we should be taking some portion of this $1.1 million out of our retained earnings.

707
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:44,974
[SPEAKER_19]: So I make a motion to take half of that money out of retained earnings.

708
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:48,456
[SPEAKER_19]: We have over $7 million we've taken from the rate payers.

709
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:52,597
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know how, I've asked in the past how high,

710
00:55:53,589 --> 00:56:05,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor's office wants that to get, but it's money that the taxpayers have already given to the city through the water and sewer rates, and I think we should be using some of that money.

711
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:13,558
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion for approval as amended by Vice President Mungo-Curran.

712
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:14,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute.

713
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:20,682
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't have the amendment and then vote for this because one offsets the other.

714
00:56:21,302 --> 00:56:21,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

715
00:56:22,182 --> 00:56:23,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do we do?

716
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:24,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Vote for the amendment first.

717
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:32,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the amendment, Sevid, do we need a roll call on that?

718
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:38,311
[SPEAKER_27]: So do we do it as a B paper?

719
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:38,831
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

720
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,172
[SPEAKER_27]: So as a B paper,

721
00:56:49,669 --> 00:56:57,436
[SPEAKER_25]: The amendment that, the B paper that apportioned what was the dollar amount you asked for, Madam Vice President?

722
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,342
[SPEAKER_19]: I can use my calculator if you want an exact number.

723
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:24,403
[SPEAKER_19]: $583,000 would be half.

724
00:57:25,363 --> 00:57:36,789
[SPEAKER_25]: So that $583,000 be taken from the water sewer enterprise account to pay towards this project as a B paper.

725
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:39,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam?

726
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President, if I may.

727
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:51,496
[SPEAKER_13]: If we do not request the $2.12 million, we will not get a 45% grant on amounts that are not requested.

728
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:54,185
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not based upon work that the city is doing.

729
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:57,026
[SPEAKER_13]: It's based upon the amount requested to the MWRA.

730
00:57:57,086 --> 00:57:58,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify that.

731
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:12,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you're making the request for the money to do the work and you can come up with a figure that's less than what's needed and you're still accomplishing the job, what's the problem?

732
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:18,436
[SPEAKER_11]: This grant, I don't see anything in this application other than a date stating September of 2014.

733
00:58:20,732 --> 00:58:28,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So with September of 2014 and with the figures that are in here, are you using the figures that are in here in 2015?

734
00:58:28,574 --> 00:58:28,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

735
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:39,378
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're using both the contract that we have currently in existence as well as the projects that are planned to be done in the next two years.

736
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have anticipated projects to be done with a cost proposal, correct?

737
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,179
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

738
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:44,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is that?

739
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:47,300
[SPEAKER_11]: That's another thing we didn't get.

740
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that is one of the documents that we will make sure that you get with the breakdown.

741
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:57,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's unfortunate, Louise, because you say we will make sure we're going to get them.

742
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:05,439
[SPEAKER_11]: You're asking us to vote for something, and you're asking us to tell us this is where it's going to be up to Project 5, and we have to ask the questions.

743
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:06,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are the documents?

744
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want us to vote on something.

745
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not fair.

746
00:59:10,802 --> 00:59:14,023
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an intelligent way to make a presentation asking for $2 million.

747
00:59:16,004 --> 00:59:16,765
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my position.

748
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:23,586
[SPEAKER_19]: And through the chair, on top of that, I just don't know where to go with that either.

749
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:29,447
[SPEAKER_19]: We're left with no time to review because you need the vote tonight.

750
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:30,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct?

751
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:33,667
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

752
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:38,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Or there will be no work that gets done during this construction season.

753
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:44,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the next time that the application is due is October 20th, they're usually due.

754
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:48,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the third week in October, with a review by the MWRA,

755
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,537
[SPEAKER_13]: the third week in November.

756
00:59:51,837 --> 00:59:54,558
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be in the same position three months from now.

757
00:59:54,778 --> 00:59:55,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a point of clarification.

758
00:59:56,278 --> 00:59:56,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

759
00:59:57,098 --> 01:00:02,960
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't apply for that, we have over $7.5 million sitting in our own Water and Sewer Enterprise account that can accomplish the same thing.

760
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:12,123
[SPEAKER_11]: So why would you make anyone want to think that if we don't do this, we don't have the money to do this project, when we do have the money to do this project?

761
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:18,425
[SPEAKER_13]: If we do not apply, first of all, there is only retained earnings.

762
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:33,306
[SPEAKER_13]: as a fiscal year 15 that I'm showing for sewers, $4,376,000, and if we do not apply for the loan, we have to come up with the full $2.12 million, which is half of what is in retained earnings.

763
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:38,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And we already have it, with over $4 million in a combination of over 7 1⁄2 million with water and sewer.

764
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:43,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So since this is a sewer part project, I don't understand what the problem here is.

765
01:00:45,754 --> 01:00:48,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Beside not getting the information timely like we should have,

766
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:58,446
[SPEAKER_11]: and having a committee of the whole ahead of time to discuss it and understand it and understanding what council along with current has just asked for taking 575 out of the retained earnings portion of it.

767
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:01,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't understand it.

768
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:05,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, how do you explain this to the taxpayers of this community that this is the way to do business?

769
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:08,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand this.

770
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:16,370
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you left us with a, in a predicament left me in a predicament because I just feel like this is a, a voted,

771
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:30,606
[SPEAKER_19]: should be taken because we're getting the 45%, but then a vote that really shouldn't be taken because we were given a piece of paper on Friday asking for a $2 million bond, you know, a $1.1 million bond.

772
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:34,149
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's fiscally irresponsible for me to take a vote like that.

773
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:40,616
[SPEAKER_19]: We were given, you know, some sort of application and a brief outline of the five projects,

774
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:50,427
[SPEAKER_19]: This deserved an hour and a half subcommittee meeting to discuss it beforehand, or at least some paperwork on Friday so we had something to read and understand.

775
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:55,991
[SPEAKER_19]: I just assumed we were going to talk about it briefly and send it to committee, but now we're left tonight having to take a vote.

776
01:01:57,112 --> 01:02:02,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the city's in a predicament because you don't have the usual votes that you need.

777
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:08,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Very, very tough position for me.

778
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:12,193
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe in what the two of you do.

779
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:15,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I just feel like, you know, we were given nothing, absolutely nothing.

780
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,740
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a motion on the floor for approval.

781
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,481
[SPEAKER_21]: So, lady, I'd like to speak.

782
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:25,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, if I may.

783
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:26,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

784
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:32,407
[SPEAKER_31]: To the city engineer, is it safe to say that there is a need for infrastructure improvements to a water and sewer system?

785
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:33,948
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

786
01:02:34,768 --> 01:02:35,829
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it also safe to say that

787
01:02:36,412 --> 01:02:40,614
[SPEAKER_31]: The plan that's in place right now that you're working with will be the plan that we work with going into the future?

788
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:41,095
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

789
01:02:43,856 --> 01:02:54,622
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it safe to say that if the construction and repairs of the system are put off that the inflow and infiltration will actually increase and continue to increase and continue to raise our sewage rate?

790
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:56,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Pipes continue to deteriorate.

791
01:02:57,284 --> 01:03:03,187
[SPEAKER_31]: So not only will rates remain the same, they could probably potentially get worse in terms of inflow and infiltration?

792
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:09,304
[SPEAKER_14]: It's possible, and costs, next year's costs are always higher than this year's costs for repair.

793
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:17,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, I agree 100% with our city engineer's answers to those questions, 100%.

794
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:29,408
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think it's our job as city councilors to know what we're voting on, know that there's a $2 million request to know what projects are being done, not the night of, but maybe

795
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:44,794
[SPEAKER_19]: a couple days beforehand, maybe a weekend beforehand, so that we can review, understand, and make an intelligent decision on a matter that is, you know, we're not talking about $200, we're talking about $2 million.

796
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:48,878
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I don't disagree, and that's why I took out the time to sit down with Ms.

797
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:51,021
[SPEAKER_31]: Miller and talk to her about the project before the meeting tonight.

798
01:03:51,850 --> 01:04:04,667
[SPEAKER_31]: You know I to take my responsibility very seriously and for two million bucks certainly questions I want to get answered and that's why I spoke with her about it before tonight So that I'd be in a position to intelligently speak about it and to move forward on the issue You know with that being said

799
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:09,481
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it's safe to say that our water and sewer infrastructure isn't going to improve any.

800
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:10,882
[SPEAKER_31]: The plan's not going to change.

801
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:12,904
[SPEAKER_31]: The plan that we have here is in place.

802
01:04:12,944 --> 01:04:15,746
[SPEAKER_31]: The question comes down to whether or not this is the way we want to fund it or not.

803
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:28,396
[SPEAKER_31]: And when you look at making an investment of $2.12 million and getting back 45% of that money right off the bat, and then over a five-year period paying off the remainder at 0% interest,

804
01:04:29,306 --> 01:04:30,806
[SPEAKER_31]: I think financially, this makes sense.

805
01:04:31,027 --> 01:04:33,207
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, you watch the Jordan's Furniture commercials.

806
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:39,009
[SPEAKER_31]: Everybody's running down there to buy a couch interest-free for five years, you know what I mean, hoping that the Red Sox hit the hole in the green monster.

807
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:40,990
[SPEAKER_31]: It makes sense, you know what I mean?

808
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:41,870
[SPEAKER_31]: An interest-free loan.

809
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:44,991
[SPEAKER_31]: Why take money out of the bank?

810
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:47,952
[SPEAKER_31]: Why take money out of our reserves when we can get an interest-free loan?

811
01:04:47,972 --> 01:04:54,454
[SPEAKER_31]: We can use those reserves annually if we see it fit to pay down that bond or that loan at a zero percent.

812
01:04:54,905 --> 01:05:02,368
[SPEAKER_31]: But ultimately, why take the money out of the bank right now and put it into one basket when we can have that money and use that to leverage other projects.

813
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,549
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that's what we're doing.

814
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:07,671
[SPEAKER_31]: We're using this money in our water sewer enterprise account and our reserves to leverage projects.

815
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:10,592
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're continuing to leverage, use this money to leverage projects.

816
01:05:11,092 --> 01:05:12,813
[SPEAKER_31]: We're using this leverage to get things done.

817
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:16,154
[SPEAKER_31]: Once the money's gone, the leverage is gone and the work stops.

818
01:05:16,654 --> 01:05:21,076
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think that, you know, in terms of municipal finance, this makes good sense.

819
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,558
[SPEAKER_31]: And I support the paper as filed wholeheartedly.

820
01:05:28,948 --> 01:05:35,713
[SPEAKER_11]: On that subject, when we talk about leverage, you're leveraging the taxpayers' money that have been sitting in a non-interest-paying account for many, many years.

821
01:05:35,753 --> 01:05:37,354
[SPEAKER_11]: We're leveraging our ability to borrow.

822
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:44,399
[SPEAKER_11]: We're leveraging the money that the taxpayers have been paying that has accumulated approximately $7.5 million.

823
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,981
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very important subject matter.

824
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:52,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, we had a Committee of the Whole meeting on the CPA, okay?

825
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:53,466
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a community preservation act.

826
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:59,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you want to compare that to the $2 million, I think the Community Preservation Act could have weighed it to August, and that could have been our Committee of the Whole meeting.

827
01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:05,550
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a matter of the process and the priorities that take place here in this community, and this is too important of an issue.

828
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,590
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the money to spend for this.

829
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,571
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our reserves account of $4.5 million.

830
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think the process was presented properly.

831
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:16,772
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have to come to a meeting and ask for the information,

832
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:22,489
[SPEAKER_11]: and then they have to go and Xerox it during the course of the meeting and you still don't have all the locations.

833
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Councillor Caviello just alluded to,

834
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:26,278
[SPEAKER_11]: with the 19 catch basins.

835
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:28,840
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't even know which catch basins there are.

836
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,944
[SPEAKER_11]: This is such an important issue that this council has been talking about for so many, many months.

837
01:06:34,384 --> 01:06:38,287
[SPEAKER_11]: INI, leak detection, water and sewer construction, and street reconstruction.

838
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,949
[SPEAKER_11]: The Winthrop Street Rotary, we had many conversations over that.

839
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:43,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Committee of the Whole meeting's over that.

840
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:51,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And tonight we're asking for $2.1 million, quick, quick, quick, because the MWRA is saying that if we don't have this by August 20th, we're gonna lose our-

841
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:55,115
[SPEAKER_31]: You just said we were talking about it for 10 years.

842
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:56,856
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been talking about infiltration.

843
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:57,878
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been talking about inflow.

844
01:06:57,898 --> 01:06:58,959
[SPEAKER_31]: We've been talking about it for 10 years.

845
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:02,463
[SPEAKER_31]: Now we have a paper in front of us that's actually going to give us results instead of rhetoric.

846
01:07:02,763 --> 01:07:04,525
[SPEAKER_31]: It's going to give us results instead of rhetoric.

847
01:07:05,266 --> 01:07:06,727
[SPEAKER_31]: We spend the money or we don't, Mr. President.

848
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:08,769
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that that's where we're at at this point in time.

849
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,073
[SPEAKER_31]: We need the full votes to get the paper to pass its first reading.

850
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:13,902
[SPEAKER_31]: We can debate this all day.

851
01:07:13,922 --> 01:07:16,264
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we all agree that the water and sewer system needs upgrades.

852
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,787
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we all agree that the water and sewer system is deteriorating.

853
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:20,969
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we all agree that something needs to be done.

854
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:22,750
[SPEAKER_31]: The question is, how are we going to do it?

855
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,651
[SPEAKER_31]: How are we going to fund it?

856
01:07:24,132 --> 01:07:26,093
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that the paper before us is a good way to fund it.

857
01:07:26,274 --> 01:07:27,074
[SPEAKER_31]: That's why I support it.

858
01:07:27,455 --> 01:07:28,776
[SPEAKER_31]: Other individuals don't feel that way.

859
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:29,677
[SPEAKER_31]: Why don't we put it to a vote?

860
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:34,181
[SPEAKER_11]: With all due respect to my colleague, Mr. President, he had his opportunity to speak and I'm going to have mine.

861
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And mine is very simply this.

862
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:37,784
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're talking about talking about it for 10 years.

863
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:45,967
[SPEAKER_11]: And each and every—for the last five to six years, you've had an accumulated—an accumulated net surplus that never went back to the rate payers in this community.

864
01:07:45,987 --> 01:08:02,302
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a gentleman over here that just gave you a sighting section of the law that turned around and told you if there was a surplus at the end of the year and there was no ongoing projects—and I think the projects has to be within a 90-day startup period of time—that that surplus was supposed to go back to the rate payers of this community, so they don't have to pay a water and sewer rate increase in their bills.

865
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:03,223
[SPEAKER_11]: That's number one.

866
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:13,904
[SPEAKER_11]: The other part of this whole situation is the presentation, the process.

867
01:08:14,704 --> 01:08:16,445
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we consider to be important here?

868
01:08:16,925 --> 01:08:22,629
[SPEAKER_11]: On this particular night, we're talking about $2.5 million or $2.1 million.

869
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:27,231
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to ask for the information, and we still don't have all the information.

870
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:28,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's wrong.

871
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,833
[SPEAKER_11]: We have access to our money and the retained earnings.

872
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel very comfortable in going there, and I feel very comfortable in knowing that the ratepayers' money will now be used for something rather than sitting there, as the administration says, the more we keep it in the air, it increases our bond rating.

873
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:49,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not worried about bond rating anymore, because the taxpayers, their streets, their sidewalks, their sewer infrastructure is beyond repair.

874
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:52,925
[SPEAKER_11]: When you talk about first time in 10 years, well, where was the city 10 years ago?

875
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:53,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

876
01:08:54,226 --> 01:08:55,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Where was the city 10 years ago?

877
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:57,850
[SPEAKER_11]: The city wasn't doing what it should have done 10 years ago.

878
01:08:58,211 --> 01:09:05,400
[SPEAKER_11]: You've done all the parks over three times, but you let the streets, and you let the water, and the sewer, and the ironite deteriorate to the point that it is right now.

879
01:09:05,981 --> 01:09:11,368
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not going to vote for this tonight, because we do have the alternative, and the alternative is taking out of retained earnings.

880
01:09:11,828 --> 01:09:37,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And when anyone has to come to that podium and try to force and compel a city council to vote for something because you're in a time squeeze and this council didn't even have enough between itself to figure out to call a meeting rather than wait for the August meeting or the July meeting because of the importance of this, shame on this council and shame on the leadership of this council because we should have been informed about this, had the meeting with the water and sewer people, the city engineer Louise Miller and everyone else concerned.

881
01:09:38,037 --> 01:09:48,862
[SPEAKER_11]: To put our backs against the wall on something that we still don't know that's dated, and I don't care what anyone says, dated September 2014, still doesn't cut the mustard for me, and I am not going to take its first reading.

882
01:09:49,162 --> 01:09:55,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to use the option that we have in our city revenue, in our city reserves, and the retained earnings of our water and soil.

883
01:09:55,304 --> 01:10:04,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Ma'am, if you wish to speak, please state your name and address for the record.

884
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Joanne Haney, 123 Playstead Road.

885
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to agree with that.

886
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:13,404
[SPEAKER_04]: My water bill has skyrocketed.

887
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I am over $1,500 a year now.

888
01:10:18,425 --> 01:10:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have any water sprinklers.

889
01:10:22,086 --> 01:10:24,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not water my lawn all the time.

890
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It has gone well beyond what it should be.

891
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:33,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single time you turn around, they've raised the rates.

892
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's wrong, I think we have to think about it, and please don't approve this tonight.

893
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,132
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to really think about it.

894
01:10:43,492 --> 01:10:43,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

895
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:02,677
[SPEAKER_11]: B comes before 8-0?

896
01:11:03,857 --> 01:11:04,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the amendment.

897
01:11:05,038 --> 01:11:06,178
[SPEAKER_11]: She's amending the main motion.

898
01:11:06,919 --> 01:11:16,463
[SPEAKER_25]: The B paper, which was $500 and some odd thousand, is to be allocated from the retained earnings towards this project.

899
01:11:17,623 --> 01:11:18,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

900
01:11:20,424 --> 01:11:22,325
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Musil, Councilor Kerrio?

901
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:22,545
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

902
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:24,126
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Banks?

903
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:24,386
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

904
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:26,187
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Long-Term?

905
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:26,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

906
01:11:26,827 --> 01:11:28,287
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Marks?

907
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:28,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

908
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:29,108
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Pender?

909
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:29,448
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

910
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:31,615
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

911
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:37,237
[SPEAKER_25]: The vote of three in the negative, two in the affirmative.

912
01:11:37,257 --> 01:11:39,938
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion fails.

913
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:47,500
[SPEAKER_25]: On the main motion for approval by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Caviello.

914
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:49,681
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, through the Chair, Ms.

915
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:55,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Miller, if this is tabled until we get the information we need, where does that leave us, having to call a special meeting?

916
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:07,785
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a positive vote on the loan order before the MWRA meeting of August 20th.

917
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:14,326
[SPEAKER_19]: And through the chair, Clerk Finn, can we take all three readings August 11th?

918
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:18,507
[SPEAKER_27]: No, in loan orders, you have to take two separate readings.

919
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:20,707
[SPEAKER_19]: Two separate readings in the third?

920
01:12:20,727 --> 01:12:21,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Three separate readings.

921
01:12:21,368 --> 01:12:25,789
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, which would be first reading is at the meeting itself.

922
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,189
[SPEAKER_27]: Second is advertised.

923
01:12:35,861 --> 01:12:37,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Louis, let me ask you this question.

924
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:41,026
[SPEAKER_27]: I love it.

925
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:43,948
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying it has to take its readings.

926
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:54,018
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it takes its first read—if it takes its first reading and it's into its second before the third takes place in August, what's the problem?

927
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,272
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as it's taking its readings, it isn't like it's not taking its readings, it's taking its readings.

928
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:05,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

929
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:06,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Caviello.

930
01:13:06,596 --> 01:13:16,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, why can't we take our first reading tonight and before the next meeting, have a council of the whole meeting to have all the papers presented to us before we take a second hearing that night?

931
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:19,063
[SPEAKER_09]: My sentiments exactly, Counselor.

932
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:21,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'm sorry, I was just told,

933
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:26,137
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to have a decision by the 17th for Bond Council.

934
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:27,658
[SPEAKER_19]: What did he say?

935
01:13:27,718 --> 01:13:28,738
[SPEAKER_19]: What did he want you to say?

936
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:29,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Take the first.

937
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,019
[SPEAKER_19]: Get the information.

938
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a council hall meeting before the next meeting.

939
01:13:34,461 --> 01:13:36,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we have a hall next week or something?

940
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:38,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Or on the 11th.

941
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:41,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

942
01:13:41,805 --> 01:13:46,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Council meeting before the next meeting.

943
01:13:46,748 --> 01:13:49,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the first meeting and start the process.

944
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,271
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't like it, we can kill it.

945
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:54,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the first reading.

946
01:13:54,049 --> 01:13:58,031
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a committee of the whole meeting before the next reading.

947
01:13:58,071 --> 01:13:59,731
[SPEAKER_09]: At least the process has been started.

948
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:01,372
[SPEAKER_31]: You can call a subcommittee meeting.

949
01:14:02,212 --> 01:14:02,852
[SPEAKER_31]: You're on business.

950
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:04,353
[SPEAKER_31]: You're on transportation.

951
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,113
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion for approval.

952
01:14:07,133 --> 01:14:08,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

953
01:14:08,454 --> 01:14:09,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caviello.

954
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:09,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

955
01:14:09,314 --> 01:14:09,634
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilman.

956
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:09,754
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

957
01:14:09,834 --> 01:14:11,255
[SPEAKER_31]: Vice President O'Connor.

958
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:23,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

959
01:14:25,488 --> 01:14:25,708
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

960
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:28,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

961
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:33,932
[SPEAKER_25]: With the vote of four in the affirmative, uh, one negative, two absent the motion passes.

962
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:41,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I may, through the chair, just to call a committee, the whole meeting, whether it be August 11th at five 30, um, to

963
01:14:43,269 --> 01:14:46,312
[SPEAKER_19]: discuss the paperwork that we're obviously hopefully going to get beforehand.

964
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:50,575
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll have one in the intervening weeks before the next meeting of the council.

965
01:14:50,755 --> 01:14:53,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, people out there with children, they'd like to speak.

966
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:55,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Council night.

967
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I know the suspension of the rules.

968
01:14:58,482 --> 01:15:10,612
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a paper in hand, uh, from the city solicitor, uh, to the city, uh, council and president from my family city solicitor regarding the Brooks estate caretakers matter.

969
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:19,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council, I respectfully request that I be given the opportunity to update you on the status of our discussions on the above-captioned matter.

970
01:15:19,877 --> 01:15:24,079
[SPEAKER_26]: Since the matter is not finalized, this update should be given in Executive Session.

971
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair awaits a motion to go into Executive Session.

972
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:31,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd like to ask Mr. Rumley, if he wouldn't mind, there are a group of folks out here with some children.

973
01:15:31,603 --> 01:15:35,666
[SPEAKER_11]: They would like to address the Council as it relates to the issue in their neighborhood.

974
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:39,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So rather than go into Executive Session, could you just wait to let them speak first?

975
01:15:41,296 --> 01:15:41,536
[SPEAKER_11]: You mind?

976
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:42,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

977
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:42,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

978
01:15:43,557 --> 01:15:46,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to table the matter in the hands of the president.

979
01:15:46,619 --> 01:15:49,361
[SPEAKER_25]: In the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

980
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:50,441
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

981
01:15:51,822 --> 01:15:53,463
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this mysterious matter, Councilor?

982
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,925
[SPEAKER_11]: There are residents out there that would like to speak on the matter.

983
01:15:57,165 --> 01:15:58,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they on the agenda?

984
01:15:58,106 --> 01:16:00,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have to call an agenda item, Mr. Councilor?

985
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:00,747
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't.

986
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:02,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

987
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:03,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the agenda.

988
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:05,610
[SPEAKER_07]: May you open up?

989
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is a trick.

990
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:08,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So it isn't a trick.

991
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:11,650
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-594.

992
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,832
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-594, yeah.

993
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:20,515
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Penta to take item number 15-594 out of order.

994
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,336
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

995
01:16:22,356 --> 01:16:22,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

996
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:22,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

997
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:24,037
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

998
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:24,157
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

999
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:24,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1000
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:29,620
[SPEAKER_25]: Motions before us.

1001
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,863
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-594 petition by Michael Ruggiero.

1002
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:52,661
[SPEAKER_25]: 18 Pembroke Street, Medford, Mass., to address the Council on appointing a traffic engineer, either through MassDOT or contractually, to study congestion, speeding, and heavy trucking to alleviate problems of the residential streets.

1003
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:54,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Councillors.

1004
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:55,761
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Michael Leggero.

1005
01:16:55,801 --> 01:16:57,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1006
01:16:57,402 --> 01:17:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for taking this issue out of order to make sure that a number of families can speak.

1007
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:03,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to speak briefly.

1008
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,138
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of people want to talk about this issue.

1009
01:17:05,178 --> 01:17:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing I want to address is what is a transportation engineer?

1010
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, the role that we're looking for is called transportation engineer.

1011
01:17:14,081 --> 01:17:18,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Traffic engineer would also be okay, but transportation engineer has a broader role.

1012
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:23,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Really quickly, a transportation engineer has safety implications.

1013
01:17:24,388 --> 01:17:31,793
[SPEAKER_07]: They study and report unsafe road conditions, and they work with local police to report on speeding hotspots.

1014
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:36,636
[SPEAKER_07]: They also work with police to identify potholes into roads.

1015
01:17:37,096 --> 01:17:38,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It has economic implications.

1016
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:47,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Transportation engineers survey pedestrian flow in commercial areas, suggest improvements to help get more of our shoppers into our stores.

1017
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:50,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, they also help us alleviate traffic.

1018
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:59,843
[SPEAKER_07]: They explore public transportation options, safe bike lanes, and they also help choose which routes to ship on.

1019
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:10,335
[SPEAKER_07]: This would cost the city roughly $80,000 a year if you decide to hire someone full-time, but other options exist to also hire a traffic engineer contractually through MassDOT.

1020
01:18:11,043 --> 01:18:15,705
[SPEAKER_07]: or even to work with Tufts and have students study traffic patterns as well.

1021
01:18:16,786 --> 01:18:19,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are some possible suggestions of issues that could be worked on.

1022
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: First, we could consider streets that are now being used as cutoffs.

1023
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:29,251
[SPEAKER_07]: A transportation engineer would perhaps suggest

1024
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,612
[SPEAKER_07]: laying down speed bumps in those areas.

1025
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:41,795
[SPEAKER_07]: They could also compile a searchable online list of street hazards, such as potholes, where residents could actually track road improvements.

1026
01:18:42,015 --> 01:18:49,457
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of residents I've talked to throughout the city of Medford, they have potholes in front of their house that have existed for years.

1027
01:18:50,177 --> 01:18:58,920
[SPEAKER_07]: If there was a transportation engineer with an online database, it would allow people to actually see where they are on their improvement.

1028
01:18:59,273 --> 01:19:03,496
[SPEAKER_07]: could also study the effects of Medford parking and offer solutions to us.

1029
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:07,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, they could spear line the Green Line expansion.

1030
01:19:08,398 --> 01:19:09,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of options for this.

1031
01:19:09,879 --> 01:19:13,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a little handy visual if you want to check it out.

1032
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a number of families that I'm going to invite to step up to speak about traffic issues on their streets.

1033
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:21,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys can come up now.

1034
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:22,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for waiting.

1035
01:19:31,008 --> 01:19:33,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilman, uh, address for the record.

1036
01:19:33,989 --> 01:19:34,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

1037
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:39,850
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is William Oliver and I'm at 69 Arlington street, Medford mass.

1038
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:49,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to bring before you, um, an issue which I observed back in, I believe it was, uh, August of last year.

1039
01:19:50,672 --> 01:19:56,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, my next, my neighbor's cat, uh, who live Rennell, uh, and I,

1040
01:19:57,431 --> 01:20:00,433
[SPEAKER_08]: don't know his last name, but he lives at 68 Arlington Street.

1041
01:20:00,493 --> 01:20:16,385
[SPEAKER_08]: His cat happened to be walking across the street about seven o'clock in the morning when a car came through at a very high rate of speed, hit the cat, killed it, went through the stop sign, and proceeded down the street.

1042
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:21,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this because my neighbor at 65 Arlington Street

1043
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:24,663
[SPEAKER_08]: was out in the middle of the street yelling for the car to stop.

1044
01:20:25,444 --> 01:20:27,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And the car did not stop.

1045
01:20:29,206 --> 01:20:38,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I observed a number of times after that where cars are coming through the intersection at a very high rate without stopping.

1046
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:49,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is mainly commuters cutting over from Route 60 over to Route 16 based upon the traffic pattern

1047
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:56,190
[SPEAKER_08]: which is in Arlington, which gets backed up over the Mystic River Bridge on Route 60.

1048
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:18,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought that was a concern, so I called the Medford Police, and the Medford Police basically said that they have a number of different streets and roads which are very hazardous due to early morning commute, and it's mainly the early morning commute versus the evening commute, which we see this behavior.

1049
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to bring this to your attention.

1050
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:22,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1051
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:23,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1052
01:21:25,091 --> 01:21:25,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1053
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:26,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.

1054
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:27,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1055
01:21:28,412 --> 01:21:28,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1056
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:33,133
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ruth Youngblood and I live at 72 Arlington street.

1057
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:36,674
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of issues.

1058
01:21:37,574 --> 01:21:42,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we, I live right near Duggar park.

1059
01:21:42,555 --> 01:21:43,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1060
01:21:44,596 --> 01:21:46,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And people come off of,

1061
01:21:48,177 --> 01:21:58,844
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 coming down, and there is a stop sign, four-way stop sign, going across between Arlington Street and Fairfield.

1062
01:21:59,725 --> 01:22:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: People just drive by there, don't stop, are eased, and they go, shh.

1063
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a guard, because there have been too many almost, almost.

1064
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:15,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has to be something.

1065
01:22:16,312 --> 01:22:19,834
[SPEAKER_01]: to deter this traffic.

1066
01:22:21,094 --> 01:22:26,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm retired, and I look out the window at between 7.30 and 8 o'clock.

1067
01:22:26,537 --> 01:22:29,718
[SPEAKER_01]: They fly through there, even in the evening.

1068
01:22:30,318 --> 01:22:35,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of children now that are out, and they're playing in the playground.

1069
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:37,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And God forbid,

1070
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:43,817
[SPEAKER_01]: If any, I have a grandson and his friends.

1071
01:22:44,718 --> 01:22:52,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two daycares and one French school at the community center, which is closed now for the summer.

1072
01:22:53,424 --> 01:23:00,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two daycares and all the children, and even people from Arlington, come over to play in that playground.

1073
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:04,131
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently people just don't care.

1074
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:06,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Another point is that,

1075
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Mystic River Road that meets Arlington Street.

1076
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:15,552
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a stop sign there.

1077
01:23:16,775 --> 01:23:35,660
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's Arlington Street, and it's Mystic River Road, and those people come down that path, that path, and they fly down there, and I have to look and stop, because I live on the Arlington Street, and when I get to that D, and I see people, they don't stop.

1078
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:40,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, so good, there has not been any accidents at all.

1079
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But like William was saying, that there should be a speed bump.

1080
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:51,402
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be something there, and especially for the kids.

1081
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:52,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1082
01:23:58,443 --> 01:23:58,763
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi there.

1083
01:23:58,803 --> 01:24:00,884
[SPEAKER_36]: Kimmy Saradon, 61 Arlington Street.

1084
01:24:00,904 --> 01:24:02,464
[SPEAKER_36]: Got a lot of Arlington Street here tonight.

1085
01:24:03,904 --> 01:24:06,325
[SPEAKER_36]: You've probably heard from my house

1086
01:24:07,646 --> 01:24:18,096
[SPEAKER_36]: at your office as well as the city police and the state police with regards to some of the traffic problems in our neighborhood as well as with regards to the speeding boats on the Mystic River.

1087
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:25,102
[SPEAKER_36]: There is quite commonly drag racing along Mystic Valley Parkway, which is granted a DCR street.

1088
01:24:25,142 --> 01:24:30,147
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a state of Massachusetts street, but that goes right through our Medford neighborhood.

1089
01:24:30,747 --> 01:24:32,269
[SPEAKER_36]: There's oftentimes

1090
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:42,037
[SPEAKER_36]: Drag racing back there, there's people that will drive the wrong direction on that one-way street to cut through the neighborhood when they're coming off the two rotaries.

1091
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:53,824
[SPEAKER_36]: There's also a lot of people that will stop back there and use the area for recreation behind our house.

1092
01:24:54,004 --> 01:24:58,547
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm actually sandwiched between Arlington Street and Mystic Valley, and you see a lot of bad behavior

1093
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:01,602
[SPEAKER_36]: on both streets, especially during the traffic time.

1094
01:25:01,983 --> 01:25:04,384
[SPEAKER_36]: There's several suggestions that we've made.

1095
01:25:04,764 --> 01:25:15,450
[SPEAKER_36]: Speed bumps in the neighborhood, the rotary at 60 and High Street should be a much larger rotary, so it's an actual impediment to traffic just shooting right through there.

1096
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:20,993
[SPEAKER_36]: I think I just said speed bumps through there, signs, some stop signs as well.

1097
01:25:21,433 --> 01:25:27,076
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think maybe even signs that are no turns into this neighborhood between certain hours during rush hour times

1098
01:25:27,526 --> 01:25:29,587
[SPEAKER_36]: so that traffic doesn't come through our neighborhood.

1099
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:33,128
[SPEAKER_36]: We're a pretty tight-knit neighborhood over there on Arlington Street.

1100
01:25:33,148 --> 01:25:36,949
[SPEAKER_36]: We've got several daycares, as Sherry pointed out, and we've got a playground.

1101
01:25:37,009 --> 01:25:39,670
[SPEAKER_36]: There's tennis courts over there that are very active.

1102
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,830
[SPEAKER_36]: They hold classes in the morning.

1103
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:45,891
[SPEAKER_36]: There is the West Medford Community Center that also has classes throughout the day.

1104
01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:53,654
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a lot of children and families in that neighborhood, and there's a lot of people from other neighborhoods cutting through our neighborhood at a very high rate of speed.

1105
01:25:55,407 --> 01:26:06,135
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand there's traffic on 60, but alleviating that traffic, a traffic engineer could help look at ways to alleviate that traffic without using our neighborhood as a way to get through that.

1106
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,101
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Giuseppe De Simone.

1107
01:26:13,261 --> 01:26:14,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 96 Alvarez Street.

1108
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:20,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And this street, somebody's going to get killed one of these days.

1109
01:26:21,988 --> 01:26:23,669
[SPEAKER_06]: People go by the street 60, 70 miles an hour.

1110
01:26:25,465 --> 01:26:29,128
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even stop at the red line on Willis Avenue.

1111
01:26:29,988 --> 01:26:30,849
[SPEAKER_06]: They just go through.

1112
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:33,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Red light, yellow light, they don't care.

1113
01:26:34,171 --> 01:26:41,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus early in the night, days, radio, it's unbelievable.

1114
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:43,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Three o'clock in the morning, full blast.

1115
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:46,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I got two grandkids.

1116
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:49,883
[SPEAKER_06]: They wake up and they can fall asleep all night long.

1117
01:26:53,703 --> 01:27:01,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the last election for the mayor, they put a sign, no truck allowed, all over Harvard Street.

1118
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:02,765
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

1119
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:10,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was two state troop cruises stop for two or three weeks there.

1120
01:27:11,327 --> 01:27:12,447
[SPEAKER_06]: They were warning everybody.

1121
01:27:12,787 --> 01:27:15,108
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, we don't even see police anymore there.

1122
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:20,849
[SPEAKER_06]: The last years, all the sign, they took it off the city of Medford.

1123
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1124
01:27:23,123 --> 01:27:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've got to leave there.

1125
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:30,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, trucks go by there 40, 50 miles an hour, early in the morning, night, day.

1126
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:34,352
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't even get out to the driveway sometimes.

1127
01:27:34,372 --> 01:27:36,294
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to wait at least 15, 20 minutes.

1128
01:27:37,474 --> 01:27:42,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, before I get out, I will wait 10 minutes before I get out to my driveway.

1129
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:47,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And people, you tell them, you know, there's a little courtesy.

1130
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:48,183
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll laugh at you.

1131
01:27:49,549 --> 01:27:51,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pay tax like everybody else.

1132
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:54,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Something has got to be done before somebody get killed.

1133
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:57,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I got two grandkids and something happened.

1134
01:27:58,632 --> 01:28:00,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to, I'm going to go after the city of Medford.

1135
01:28:01,994 --> 01:28:02,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1136
01:28:06,335 --> 01:28:08,356
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, my name is Gina Nuzzo.

1137
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:08,856
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1138
01:28:09,336 --> 01:28:11,377
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm on 133 Willis Ave in Medford.

1139
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,380
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually, Giuseppe is one of my neighbors.

1140
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:27,383
[SPEAKER_35]: And I also wanted to talk to you about the intersection of Harvard and Willis, which I'm sure you know it tends to be one of the high rate of accidents in the city of Medford.

1141
01:28:27,403 --> 01:28:28,383
[SPEAKER_35]: We have a lot of them.

1142
01:28:29,183 --> 01:28:35,965
[SPEAKER_35]: But beyond that, I wanted to introduce you to a term that all of our neighbors are very familiar with, and that's truck quakes.

1143
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:37,725
[SPEAKER_35]: So instead of earthquakes, we have truck

1144
01:28:39,202 --> 01:28:44,845
[SPEAKER_35]: And that is caused by our homes actually vibrating, actually shaking the foundations.

1145
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:46,846
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm not talking small trucks.

1146
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:51,489
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm talking 18-whalers just coming down the streets at all times.

1147
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:53,350
[SPEAKER_35]: And our homes are physically shaking.

1148
01:28:54,331 --> 01:29:01,135
[SPEAKER_35]: I think beyond it just being a nuisance in terms of noise or whatever, there's a real safety and health concern that goes with it.

1149
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:06,285
[SPEAKER_35]: For example, nobody opens their windows on the street anymore because of the exhaust.

1150
01:29:07,165 --> 01:29:07,926
[SPEAKER_35]: You just can't.

1151
01:29:07,966 --> 01:29:09,946
[SPEAKER_35]: You open the window, it's like, where's the fresh air?

1152
01:29:10,026 --> 01:29:11,407
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not there.

1153
01:29:11,467 --> 01:29:13,647
[SPEAKER_35]: The exhaust coming out of the trucks is significant.

1154
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:24,970
[SPEAKER_35]: And then also, I think from a safety perspective, I mean, it's just a matter of time before a kid goes rolling out after a ball, or I think we've heard about trucks

1155
01:29:25,989 --> 01:29:35,099
[SPEAKER_35]: And accidents happening, you know, with more frequency, especially in the last couple of years, if it happens in a residential neighborhood, I think it can be catastrophic.

1156
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,802
[SPEAKER_35]: So I really do hope that you consider it.

1157
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:42,186
[SPEAKER_35]: As Giuseppe mentioned, there were signs that went up.

1158
01:29:42,987 --> 01:29:46,370
[SPEAKER_35]: I did follow up with the police in terms of why they came down, and they said that

1159
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:50,527
[SPEAKER_35]: It wasn't easy to pull these trucks over.

1160
01:29:50,547 --> 01:29:56,249
[SPEAKER_35]: And I thought, well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that you can probably pull them over on Mystic Ave, right?

1161
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,990
[SPEAKER_35]: Just kind of hide behind that.

1162
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:02,732
[SPEAKER_35]: So, I mean, I do hope that you consider the traffic along that street.

1163
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:06,914
[SPEAKER_35]: I know it's a main cut through, but perhaps we can alleviate some of the truck traffic.

1164
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:07,634
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

1165
01:30:07,854 --> 01:30:08,274
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1166
01:30:14,017 --> 01:30:15,017
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Edward DeAngelo.

1167
01:30:15,478 --> 01:30:17,520
[SPEAKER_34]: I live on 8 Suffolk Street in Medford.

1168
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,141
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a relatively new resident.

1169
01:30:20,622 --> 01:30:26,046
[SPEAKER_34]: I also represent several other people with children that were here for a while but had to leave because of the timing.

1170
01:30:27,467 --> 01:30:28,288
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a pediatrician.

1171
01:30:28,668 --> 01:30:32,391
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm very concerned about safety of children on my street.

1172
01:30:33,492 --> 01:30:39,676
[SPEAKER_34]: We are also a cut through, 293 people avoiding Winthrop Square by cutting through Suffolk.

1173
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:46,761
[SPEAKER_34]: Obviously, there's a lot of individual stories and lots of cut-throughs and lots of bad traffic situations.

1174
01:30:47,261 --> 01:30:59,465
[SPEAKER_34]: But I think Mr. Ruggiero's issue is an important one, which is this traffic issue in a city the size of Medford has to be approached systematically and needs to be data-driven.

1175
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:03,346
[SPEAKER_34]: You're hearing data now, but that's just only because we happen to be having a meeting.

1176
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:05,167
[SPEAKER_34]: But there's probably lots of other places.

1177
01:31:05,647 --> 01:31:11,349
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would certainly support some kind of approach to bring on an expert who can analyze it systematically

1178
01:31:11,736 --> 01:31:17,601
[SPEAKER_34]: and apply appropriate metrics to evaluate for safety, traffic flow, and many other issues that are so important here.

1179
01:31:17,741 --> 01:31:19,143
[SPEAKER_34]: So I support this.

1180
01:31:26,129 --> 01:31:26,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1181
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Christopher DeVita, 67 West Street.

1182
01:31:30,052 --> 01:31:34,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spoken on occasion before this council about pedestrian safety issues.

1183
01:31:34,616 --> 01:31:35,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It's become an issue.

1184
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere, as I think you are hearing now, I think you could probably pretty much have every single resident in Medford come up here and talk about how pedestrian safety and traffic problems here are just a little bit out of control now.

1185
01:31:52,848 --> 01:32:02,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I live on a street that's a one-way, but that doesn't prevent people going 40 miles per hour the wrong way down my street, because somehow going faster means you won't get caught.

1186
01:32:05,335 --> 01:32:06,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can tell you that

1187
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:30,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a city planner by trade, and I've worked with a lot of transportation engineers, and I support the creation of the position, but I have to say that if you just put the transportation engineer out there on his or her own without any backup and implementation monies, they're just gonna give you a lot of data, and unfortunately, data that we already know.

1188
01:32:31,761 --> 01:32:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to have a holistic approach to this where we really support

1189
01:32:37,683 --> 01:32:48,568
[SPEAKER_05]: the creation of a proper traffic and engineering department here and put the monies behind it to change this behavior.

1190
01:32:49,748 --> 01:32:57,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it requires hiring more police to do enforcement, I think we should do that.

1191
01:32:57,592 --> 01:33:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's the issue, I'm not really sure it is, but if it is the issue, then we should look at that.

1192
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:04,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of about the how

1193
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:08,640
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what kind of city do we want to live in at this point?

1194
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:15,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, as you can hear from everyone who's spoken, uh, it's not the one we currently have right now.

1195
01:33:16,401 --> 01:33:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1196
01:33:23,062 --> 01:33:24,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Sharon Wentworth.

1197
01:33:24,623 --> 01:33:26,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 694 Winthrop street.

1198
01:33:27,663 --> 01:33:29,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed a very big difference.

1199
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been there a long time.

1200
01:33:30,704 --> 01:33:33,945
[SPEAKER_12]: The car start, the truck started four o'clock in the morning.

1201
01:33:35,005 --> 01:33:35,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

1202
01:33:36,051 --> 01:33:42,054
[SPEAKER_12]: they're going down so fast that they're beeping behind you when you're following the speed.

1203
01:33:42,734 --> 01:33:44,355
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they go around you.

1204
01:33:44,735 --> 01:33:50,638
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a school and a park on that street, the high school, Victory Park.

1205
01:33:51,639 --> 01:34:01,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I really want to make, I'm not sure if you already know, is where Playstead meets and Winthrop Street, the buses sit there.

1206
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:02,644
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't get out.

1207
01:34:03,884 --> 01:34:04,625
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't see.

1208
01:34:06,068 --> 01:34:07,629
[SPEAKER_12]: You got buses on Winthrop.

1209
01:34:08,029 --> 01:34:09,770
[SPEAKER_12]: You got buses on Playstead.

1210
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,131
[SPEAKER_12]: You're coming up.

1211
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:13,692
[SPEAKER_12]: You're trying to take a left.

1212
01:34:14,352 --> 01:34:15,213
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't get out.

1213
01:34:17,034 --> 01:34:18,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody's going to get hit there.

1214
01:34:19,355 --> 01:34:20,215
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no light.

1215
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,057
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a flashing light, but that's it.

1216
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:27,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to make somebody aware of that.

1217
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:28,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1218
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:33,704
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.

1219
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:34,944
[SPEAKER_38]: My name's Jay Campbell.

1220
01:34:34,984 --> 01:34:36,545
[SPEAKER_38]: I live at 707 Fulton Street.

1221
01:34:37,885 --> 01:34:42,567
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to bring up that I also agree that having a traffic engineer is a fantastic idea.

1222
01:34:43,127 --> 01:34:58,572
[SPEAKER_38]: I also think, though, that some people don't realize when they talk about what's going to happen, that thanks to Medved, the community agreement with the Wynn Resorts is actually already have 12 different intersections that they're planning on redoing, which includes Wellington Circle.

1223
01:34:58,612 --> 01:35:02,313
[SPEAKER_38]: But there's also where I live, Fulton Street and Felsway, they're going to redo that.

1224
01:35:03,025 --> 01:35:06,166
[SPEAKER_38]: They're also going to redo Salem Street and Fells Way.

1225
01:35:06,366 --> 01:35:10,007
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's many spots, some of the places that people have talked about, they want someone to do something.

1226
01:35:10,667 --> 01:35:12,207
[SPEAKER_38]: It's already being in the works to get done.

1227
01:35:13,468 --> 01:35:15,548
[SPEAKER_38]: And the MEPA process is going right now with WIND.

1228
01:35:16,089 --> 01:35:23,390
[SPEAKER_38]: Once that gets approved, some of these things are going to happen, because based on the agreement, they're going to take place before the casino opens, before the resort opens.

1229
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:32,753
[SPEAKER_38]: I think in addition to the issues that some people have with the traffic, it would also be nice to have a traffic engineer that can work with WIND to get these things done correctly and efficiently.

1230
01:35:34,037 --> 01:35:37,439
[SPEAKER_38]: as a city has already agreed to have this done and have Wynn pay for it.

1231
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:42,120
[SPEAKER_38]: So I just want to bring that up as an additional point so people are aware of that fact, if they don't know already.

1232
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:42,600
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1233
01:35:46,522 --> 01:35:47,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1234
01:35:47,142 --> 01:35:48,803
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1235
01:35:49,063 --> 01:35:49,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome.

1236
01:35:51,164 --> 01:35:51,624
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening.

1237
01:35:51,684 --> 01:36:01,948
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Joan Lovett, and I live at 75 Arlington Street, and I am right across from the Tots Playground.

1238
01:36:01,988 --> 01:36:02,728
[SPEAKER_33]: Day after day,

1239
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:08,792
[SPEAKER_33]: I see the cars coming down Mystic River Road, zoom, right through the stop sign.

1240
01:36:09,552 --> 01:36:10,313
[SPEAKER_33]: And I mean zoom.

1241
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:13,874
[SPEAKER_33]: And this happens more than once, and it happens every day.

1242
01:36:14,994 --> 01:36:18,996
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, a police detail, that's just some time.

1243
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:20,757
[SPEAKER_33]: We need something all the time.

1244
01:36:20,937 --> 01:36:26,079
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think you need a speed bump, just like Belmont has around their schools.

1245
01:36:26,979 --> 01:36:29,120
[SPEAKER_33]: Something like that could probably work.

1246
01:36:31,261 --> 01:36:32,141
[SPEAKER_33]: That's my suggestion.

1247
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:34,210
[SPEAKER_33]: You're welcome.

1248
01:36:41,392 --> 01:36:41,792
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1249
01:36:41,832 --> 01:36:43,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1250
01:36:43,392 --> 01:36:47,973
[SPEAKER_25]: Rick Giganti, 139 Harvard Street.

1251
01:36:48,013 --> 01:36:49,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hit the button, please, there?

1252
01:36:52,535 --> 01:36:54,955
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

1253
01:36:55,775 --> 01:36:57,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Rick Giganti, 139 Harvard Street.

1254
01:36:59,596 --> 01:37:00,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Where do I start?

1255
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I guess we could start first by saying,

1256
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:09,221
[SPEAKER_17]: The truck noise, that's coming up Harvard Street now is becoming more and more and more of an issue.

1257
01:37:10,462 --> 01:37:22,967
[SPEAKER_17]: We do realize that the work on Boston Ave has to be done, but the trucks are coming up, dump trucks are coming up like you cannot believe in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night.

1258
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:24,648
[SPEAKER_17]: That's one.

1259
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:30,750
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing is, is the speed now has increased dramatically.

1260
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:33,611
[SPEAKER_17]: We have speed signs, 20 miles an hour.

1261
01:37:34,512 --> 01:37:36,112
[SPEAKER_17]: That just doesn't happen.

1262
01:37:38,113 --> 01:37:48,818
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing is, I can sit on my front porch, which I don't, but I could sit and water the lawn or water the flowers in this little phone, and you can see all the people on the phone.

1263
01:37:49,839 --> 01:37:56,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Seventy percent out of every 10 cars, seven of them are on this phone, driving.

1264
01:37:57,283 --> 01:38:00,304
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know it's a law, and I know Meffitt can do something.

1265
01:38:00,752 --> 01:38:03,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the police can sit there, and they can probably do pretty good.

1266
01:38:05,235 --> 01:38:06,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we have a detail.

1267
01:38:06,356 --> 01:38:06,997
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got to do this.

1268
01:38:07,017 --> 01:38:07,617
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got to do that.

1269
01:38:08,138 --> 01:38:14,463
[SPEAKER_17]: We bring in parking with this new parking ban thing that we have going on.

1270
01:38:14,623 --> 01:38:19,206
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we can just do some things to try to help the traffic.

1271
01:38:20,707 --> 01:38:25,891
[SPEAKER_17]: We have on Harvard Street, we also have a nursery right there alone.

1272
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:27,433
[SPEAKER_17]: The kids are there.

1273
01:38:27,913 --> 01:38:29,174
[SPEAKER_17]: People are trying to get out of the driveway.

1274
01:38:29,648 --> 01:38:30,628
[SPEAKER_17]: can't get out of the driveway.

1275
01:38:30,808 --> 01:38:32,849
[SPEAKER_17]: It's impossible.

1276
01:38:33,989 --> 01:38:35,970
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know where I can ask.

1277
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,851
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to try to ask here.

1278
01:38:39,011 --> 01:38:41,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Where I live is right where the light is.

1279
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:58,017
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm wondering to help not only emergency vehicles, but to have a stop here before my driveway so that the trucks, fire trucks, can make the corner to come down Harvard Street

1280
01:38:58,397 --> 01:38:59,758
[SPEAKER_17]: being a state road that it is.

1281
01:39:00,759 --> 01:39:13,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead of going all the way up to the red light, not only will it help for that, also in the winter, cars might be able to make it through the light if they get a rolling start from behind my house instead of at the corner.

1282
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:16,570
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how to go about doing that.

1283
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:23,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe someone can inform me later, but something that I would like to think about and talk about and try to have that installed.

1284
01:39:24,733 --> 01:39:30,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe that might cut some of the traffic to slow it down a little bit instead of trying to speed up through the red light.

1285
01:39:31,978 --> 01:39:32,739
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't know if it'll work.

1286
01:39:32,979 --> 01:39:35,901
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's on Riverside Ave, but maybe that might help.

1287
01:39:37,682 --> 01:39:40,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that could cut down some of the traffic.

1288
01:39:41,384 --> 01:39:42,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that was a great talk.

1289
01:39:44,006 --> 01:39:47,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Two weeks before election, the street signs went up.

1290
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:49,369
[SPEAKER_17]: No trucks, no trucks, no trucks.

1291
01:39:49,389 --> 01:39:51,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Stadies were there and everything, and it was working.

1292
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:52,211
[SPEAKER_17]: It worked.

1293
01:39:52,552 --> 01:39:53,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it worked.

1294
01:39:53,615 --> 01:39:55,816
[SPEAKER_17]: but we knew it wasn't gonna last, and it didn't.

1295
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:59,038
[SPEAKER_17]: So anything that we can do to help, greatly appreciate it.

1296
01:39:59,058 --> 01:39:59,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1297
01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:00,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1298
01:40:05,322 --> 01:40:06,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Citizen Castagnetti.

1299
01:40:06,683 --> 01:40:07,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Dela Cruz.

1300
01:40:08,985 --> 01:40:12,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Castagnetti, Andrew, Cushion Street, 02155.

1301
01:40:13,187 --> 01:40:21,132
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may, I'd like to commend Mr. Ruggiero for at least trying to improve the traffic, automobile, et cetera, situation in the city.

1302
01:40:24,283 --> 01:40:31,787
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be wonderful if there is some improvement, and I'm sure the citizens would appreciate it, and the general public.

1303
01:40:32,808 --> 01:40:33,348
[SPEAKER_15]: I commend them.

1304
01:40:33,388 --> 01:40:33,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1305
01:40:39,912 --> 01:40:40,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Michael Ruggiero.

1306
01:40:41,013 --> 01:40:42,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1307
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:50,338
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a small sampling of the people that could be helped by having a full-time traffic engineer study these issues.

1308
01:40:51,597 --> 01:40:54,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I urge you to please vote yes on this issue.

1309
01:40:54,698 --> 01:41:01,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single street I've walked down in Medford has these problems, from Spring Street to Harvard Street to Winthrop Street.

1310
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:03,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single street I've walked down has these problems.

1311
01:41:04,882 --> 01:41:06,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I'm just one guy.

1312
01:41:06,342 --> 01:41:14,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't able to spread enough of the word out to get more people here, but I think we have an excellent opportunity to alleviate some of these problems.

1313
01:41:14,805 --> 01:41:15,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1314
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:24,121
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank the residents from the city for coming out here this evening and telling us about their concerns.

1315
01:41:25,122 --> 01:41:35,606
[SPEAKER_31]: I think it would be incumbent upon this council to make a recommendation to our Traffic Commission, Mr. President, and based on what I'm hearing, there are several items that I'd like to add to this paper by way of amendment.

1316
01:41:37,047 --> 01:41:40,708
[SPEAKER_31]: If the city clerk is ready, I think that we need to take a look at

1317
01:41:41,135 --> 01:41:47,860
[SPEAKER_31]: Utilizing the temporary speed bumps that we recently appropriated funding for through the community improvement initiative, Mr. President, along Arlington Street.

1318
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:50,962
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that would be very important, and I think that would address some of the concerns.

1319
01:41:53,743 --> 01:41:59,908
[SPEAKER_31]: I also think it would be very important for our traffic commission to take a look at the feasibility of putting a stop sign at Arlington Street and Mr. Griveaux Road.

1320
01:42:01,909 --> 01:42:10,915
[SPEAKER_31]: And utilizing the speed boards that we have, Mr. President, by way of the police department at Willis Ave, Arlington Street, and West Street to control speeds, as well as Harvard Ave, Harvard Street, rather.

1321
01:42:16,519 --> 01:42:24,583
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also think that directed patrols for enforcement of violations, Mr. President, speed and truck routes along these roadways would be imperative.

1322
01:42:26,644 --> 01:42:39,170
[SPEAKER_31]: And lastly, I think that we need to request that the Traffic Commission revisit the issue of a truck ban a long habit, because I, too, travel that road quite frequently and see four trucks back up and block the intersection, and it's a waiting game.

1323
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:41,291
[SPEAKER_31]: You just wait for the lights to change, wait for the lights to change.

1324
01:42:41,931 --> 01:42:43,952
[SPEAKER_31]: Individuals can't even get out of their driveway, Mr. President.

1325
01:42:44,508 --> 01:42:47,810
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to amend the paper by requesting that the Traffic Commission take these following steps.

1326
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:51,152
[SPEAKER_22]: This was a petition, so this will be the paper.

1327
01:42:51,172 --> 01:42:51,833
[SPEAKER_22]: It has a number.

1328
01:42:51,893 --> 01:42:52,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1329
01:42:55,655 --> 01:42:56,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caput.

1330
01:42:56,536 --> 01:42:57,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1331
01:42:57,476 --> 01:43:01,699
[SPEAKER_09]: As a person who lives on a cut-through street, I can understand why many of these people go through.

1332
01:43:01,739 --> 01:43:08,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Pinto stopped by my house the other night, and he saw people just going through the stop sign, and they weren't even there.

1333
01:43:11,165 --> 01:43:12,226
[SPEAKER_09]: The City of Medford did

1334
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:32,468
[SPEAKER_09]: asked the wing commission that Mr. Campbell talked about for $2 million a few weeks ago, which I'm the representative to the committee there, for traffic studies, and we were denied by the gaming commission the funds for the traffic studies and possibly even hiring an engineer.

1335
01:43:32,508 --> 01:43:35,149
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to let you know.

1336
01:43:35,249 --> 01:43:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some work going to be done, as Mr. Campbell said, but we did ask for the funding through that to helpfully alleviate

1337
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:48,816
[SPEAKER_09]: the Traffic Studies and the Traffic Commissioner, but we were denied those funds by the Gaming Commission.

1338
01:43:48,836 --> 01:43:52,418
[SPEAKER_09]: They just said they are not available at this particular time.

1339
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

1340
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:56,201
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Patu.

1341
01:43:56,961 --> 01:44:02,325
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that I heard here tonight was there is an inconsistency of traffic enforcement in this community.

1342
01:44:03,366 --> 01:44:09,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of the suggestions offered by Councilor Knight and as Councilor Caviello just alluded to, these are things that definitely need to be addressed.

1343
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:26,182
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that I would have a special interest in would be having a truck enforcement unit within our Method Police Department, because there are just so many trucks that are traveling through our community at high rates of speed that that's a serious concern that we have here right now.

1344
01:44:26,882 --> 01:44:30,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, this administration, you know, has not wished to delve into that.

1345
01:44:31,805 --> 01:44:35,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I can assure you, after January, it will be delved into.

1346
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:39,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result of that, we will make sure that

1347
01:44:39,643 --> 01:44:45,547
[SPEAKER_11]: public safety is looked upon seriously and not just as a temporary political fix, so to speak.

1348
01:44:47,069 --> 01:44:51,872
[SPEAKER_11]: The public safety of this community is the backbone of why people want to live here.

1349
01:44:51,892 --> 01:45:01,239
[SPEAKER_11]: In today's edition, I think it was in the Boston Globe, it said we're in the lowest third tier of people wanting to live here in the city of Medford.

1350
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,461
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the latest report that just came out today.

1351
01:45:04,362 --> 01:45:06,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result of, pardon me,

1352
01:45:10,405 --> 01:45:16,487
[SPEAKER_11]: lowest tier.

1353
01:45:17,068 --> 01:45:19,869
[SPEAKER_11]: You really want to know why you're living here in the city of Medford.

1354
01:45:20,249 --> 01:45:23,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because your real estate values are going up, is it because of the school system?

1355
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:24,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it because of the streets?

1356
01:45:24,871 --> 01:45:26,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it because of your accessibility to 93?

1357
01:45:26,311 --> 01:45:29,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it your accessibility to public transportation?

1358
01:45:29,373 --> 01:45:33,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly has nothing to do with your downtown environment, because there's nothing there.

1359
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:35,835
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no economic development in these squares.

1360
01:45:36,355 --> 01:45:38,997
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been laying in abyss for such a long period of time.

1361
01:45:40,926 --> 01:45:46,730
[SPEAKER_11]: We really need to do an awful lot of work as to find out what our city's about and where it needs to go.

1362
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:54,895
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when you talk about Somerville and some of these issues, they've come a long way in a short period of time because everybody worked together.

1363
01:45:55,195 --> 01:45:57,716
[SPEAKER_11]: They put a collective effort together.

1364
01:45:58,036 --> 01:46:01,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there's a gentleman sitting out there, and I don't want to embarrass him, but Mr. Chris DeVita.

1365
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:02,779
[SPEAKER_11]: He said he was a city planner.

1366
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:06,261
[SPEAKER_11]: He worked over there in Somerville where they had 12, 14 people at one time.

1367
01:46:07,002 --> 01:46:08,663
[SPEAKER_11]: City of Memphis has one and a half people.

1368
01:46:09,098 --> 01:46:12,640
[SPEAKER_11]: This administration only kept one and a half people working full time in that office.

1369
01:46:13,181 --> 01:46:16,303
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a sad commentary to why we don't have development.

1370
01:46:16,343 --> 01:46:21,947
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have development because there's nothing in this city to go out and develop because there's nobody out there being able to do it.

1371
01:46:22,707 --> 01:46:24,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll just leave you with this last thought.

1372
01:46:24,568 --> 01:46:26,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It's public safety and streets and roads.

1373
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:29,212
[SPEAKER_11]: But this all interconnects with each other.

1374
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:30,873
[SPEAKER_11]: It interwines with each other.

1375
01:46:31,473 --> 01:46:36,677
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, your roads will take you from A to B and B to C and C to D. And that's very important.

1376
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:38,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Your kids on the roads, bicycles,

1377
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:40,370
[SPEAKER_11]: people traveling in the summertime.

1378
01:46:40,991 --> 01:46:47,152
[SPEAKER_11]: During the summertime, more speeding tickets are given up in the city of Medford because the motorcycle patrolmen are out there.

1379
01:46:47,393 --> 01:46:49,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I met with them last night and had a conversation about that.

1380
01:46:50,493 --> 01:47:00,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what needs to be done is to have you folks call the chief of police and ask him to put his motorcycle unit in particular areas because you folks know where the issues are.

1381
01:47:00,716 --> 01:47:05,658
[SPEAKER_11]: They try to do the best they can with what they have, but if they're being told where the issues might be,

1382
01:47:06,283 --> 01:47:09,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see where that goes, and let's just see the response that comes from that.

1383
01:47:10,004 --> 01:47:10,864
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a beginning.

1384
01:47:10,904 --> 01:47:11,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a first step.

1385
01:47:12,104 --> 01:47:17,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, from there, you can take a step by saying, hey, you either were responded to, or you weren't responded to.

1386
01:47:18,006 --> 01:47:21,507
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way we're going to fix these problems, one street, one day at a time.

1387
01:47:21,927 --> 01:47:24,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we all work together, it can take place, and it will get done.

1388
01:47:25,067 --> 01:47:25,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1389
01:47:29,228 --> 01:47:31,049
[SPEAKER_09]: The President Thank you, Mr. President.

1390
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:35,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion that we send a letter to the Chief of Police

1391
01:47:36,434 --> 01:47:44,095
[SPEAKER_09]: asking him to call the state police and request that the dot truck team come to medford on occasion.

1392
01:47:45,436 --> 01:48:02,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see them on the parkway but if the dot team, they're out there everywhere, I see them all over the roads, come to medford and maybe on Salem street, high street, riverside avenue where all the trucks come, maybe on a rotating basis.

1393
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:03,779
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could do that, Mr. President.

1394
01:48:05,304 --> 01:48:10,508
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Caffiello.

1395
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:11,469
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1396
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:13,630
[SPEAKER_25]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1397
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:16,112
[SPEAKER_07]: May I ask a quick question?

1398
01:48:16,272 --> 01:48:20,015
[SPEAKER_07]: On the paper now, is there a recommendation to hire a traffic engineer?

1399
01:48:24,938 --> 01:48:26,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is.

1400
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we put it on the paper now?

1401
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:32,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at the budget meeting I was there, and I don't recall that motion coming up.

1402
01:48:33,084 --> 01:48:34,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, was it a different budget meeting?

1403
01:48:35,065 --> 01:48:49,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, does your resolution address that?

1404
01:48:49,653 --> 01:48:52,374
[SPEAKER_07]: The traffic commission is not really solving these problems right now.

1405
01:48:52,795 --> 01:48:57,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there needs to be an individual that has control of these issues.

1406
01:48:57,217 --> 01:49:00,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single street I've walked down in Medford has these problems.

1407
01:49:01,273 --> 01:49:04,294
[SPEAKER_07]: There needs to be one individual who's ultimately responsible for these issues.

1408
01:49:04,314 --> 01:49:05,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1409
01:49:05,494 --> 01:49:06,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Diller.

1410
01:49:06,834 --> 01:49:09,835
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe we should have a committee meeting on this.

1411
01:49:09,915 --> 01:49:14,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you mentioned a few different options, whether it be Tufts students, an engineer.

1412
01:49:15,417 --> 01:49:20,158
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it was brought up, well, if we have an engineer, how will we actually fix the problems?

1413
01:49:20,178 --> 01:49:22,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we need to allocate more money to do so?

1414
01:49:22,138 --> 01:49:27,600
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe just a roundtable discussion, ask Tufts to come to the meeting, ask city

1415
01:49:29,802 --> 01:49:33,865
[SPEAKER_19]: administration to maybe come in and give their two cents on something that's feasible.

1416
01:49:33,885 --> 01:49:38,609
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I definitely think it would be helpful to do, we need to do something, so.

1417
01:49:38,929 --> 01:49:40,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Subcommittee on public safety.

1418
01:49:41,091 --> 01:49:41,691
[SPEAKER_31]: Transportation.

1419
01:49:42,111 --> 01:49:42,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Or transportation.

1420
01:49:43,624 --> 01:49:49,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's fair to many of the individuals that took time out of their schedule to attend a variety of different meetings.

1421
01:49:49,850 --> 01:50:00,559
[SPEAKER_07]: While I understand that there is this issue to you want to explore different options, I hope that we can understand that many people came out today about this issue.

1422
01:50:00,919 --> 01:50:05,403
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have enough civil engineers on the Medford staff as Councilor Penta pointed out.

1423
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Having someone that actually studied transportation here directly in Medford, I think, would alleviate many of these issues.

1424
01:50:11,482 --> 01:50:12,802
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, Councillor.

1425
01:50:13,363 --> 01:50:17,104
[SPEAKER_07]: He would make recommendations, and these recommendations might actually cost more money.

1426
01:50:17,564 --> 01:50:20,345
[SPEAKER_07]: But these would be recommendations that would be needed throughout the city of Medford.

1427
01:50:20,385 --> 01:50:21,305
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't be squandering.

1428
01:50:22,646 --> 01:50:34,490
[SPEAKER_31]: My concern is that between now and when we get a transportation engineer that we went through an operating budget that we didn't fund already, and we already had this discussion just a month ago,

1429
01:50:35,964 --> 01:50:41,427
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not confident that the administration is going to act and hire a transportation engineer between now and January.

1430
01:50:41,947 --> 01:50:46,749
[SPEAKER_31]: And that means that if we make the resolution, hire a transportation engineer, none of these items get taken care of.

1431
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:55,213
[SPEAKER_31]: We still need to look at whether or not MassDOT has the ability and power and the past practice of providing transportation engineers to the community.

1432
01:50:55,533 --> 01:50:56,554
[SPEAKER_31]: I did investigation on this.

1433
01:50:56,974 --> 01:50:59,415
[SPEAKER_31]: I spoke with several individuals at MassDOT today.

1434
01:51:00,476 --> 01:51:01,296
[SPEAKER_31]: My understanding is they don't.

1435
01:51:02,348 --> 01:51:08,252
[SPEAKER_31]: They have an office that works with project managers and works with transportation planners that are working on particular projects in regions.

1436
01:51:09,173 --> 01:51:15,077
[SPEAKER_31]: They have technical assistance that they use to provide certain technical assistance to people that are working on projects in communities.

1437
01:51:15,417 --> 01:51:17,699
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think that there are a lot of financing questions here, Mr. President.

1438
01:51:17,839 --> 01:51:25,884
[SPEAKER_31]: And, you know, I think that if we don't vet it properly, it's just going to be another paper that gets sent to the corner office and sits there and collects dust in the corner office.

1439
01:51:26,705 --> 01:51:31,688
[SPEAKER_31]: But if we keep the conversation alive and take ownership of it, as opposed to passing the buck across the hall,

1440
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:34,062
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that we may be able to get better results.

1441
01:51:56,648 --> 01:51:58,209
[SPEAKER_31]: We want to talk about a transportation engineer.

1442
01:51:58,249 --> 01:52:07,517
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we should be doing that through a subcommittee process, bringing the appropriate parties to the table and building the momentum that's going to make it happen, as opposed to sending a paper across the hall and letting us sit there, Mr. President.

1443
01:52:09,503 --> 01:52:17,367
[SPEAKER_07]: A very disappointing fact in our city that when a paper is sent to the executive office, it is just, as you say, collects dust.

1444
01:52:17,827 --> 01:52:18,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That's unacceptable.

1445
01:52:18,267 --> 01:52:18,988
[SPEAKER_31]: It is what it is, though.

1446
01:52:19,008 --> 01:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, my concern is the people back here and whether or not they want these results on their streets.

1447
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:23,710
[SPEAKER_31]: You know what I mean?

1448
01:52:23,730 --> 01:52:27,792
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that this is an approach that we can take where we can effectuate change immediately is all I'm saying, Mr. President.

1449
01:52:27,812 --> 01:52:29,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then you can have two papers as well.

1450
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:31,193
[SPEAKER_31]: We could have five papers if we want.

1451
01:52:31,354 --> 01:52:36,136
[SPEAKER_31]: What I'm saying is in January, we discussed this very same topic in the subcommittee meetings, in the budget hearings.

1452
01:52:37,237 --> 01:52:38,618
[SPEAKER_31]: It wasn't included in the operating budget.

1453
01:52:38,638 --> 01:52:40,178
[SPEAKER_31]: The operating budget passed last meeting.

1454
01:52:41,179 --> 01:52:42,479
[SPEAKER_31]: Last meeting was the operating budget.

1455
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:47,762
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, here we are, the meeting after the operating budget passed, saying, create a new position and add it to the operating budget.

1456
01:52:48,142 --> 01:52:50,343
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm saying, okay, that sounds like a good idea.

1457
01:52:50,383 --> 01:52:55,926
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's sit down and let's figure out how we're going to do that, as opposed to saying, hey, over there, put this in the operating budget.

1458
01:52:56,326 --> 01:52:56,946
[SPEAKER_31]: This is what we want.

1459
01:52:57,867 --> 01:53:04,650
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's figure out how we're going to do it, how we're going to fund it, what steps we need to take, where we can find funding for it, because I think it's a good idea.

1460
01:53:05,795 --> 01:53:11,418
[SPEAKER_31]: That's why I brought it up at the budget hearings when we were having the budget hearings, because a transportation planner is a good idea, and we need help.

1461
01:53:12,298 --> 01:53:15,580
[SPEAKER_31]: Number one, revitalizing our downtowns, and number two, alleviating traffic in our community.

1462
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,581
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no question about that.

1463
01:53:17,281 --> 01:53:26,686
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think that in order for us to address issues of speed bumps and stop signs, that has to go to the traffic commission regardless of whether or not we have a traffic or transportation engineer on staff.

1464
01:53:34,139 --> 01:53:37,881
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to clarify one thing.

1465
01:53:38,982 --> 01:53:40,122
[SPEAKER_38]: For the record again, I'm sorry.

1466
01:53:41,183 --> 01:53:43,044
[SPEAKER_38]: Jay Campbell, I live at 707 Fulton.

1467
01:53:43,364 --> 01:53:47,047
[SPEAKER_38]: Just to clarify one thing that you mentioned, which you're right about going to the gaming commission.

1468
01:53:47,407 --> 01:53:50,669
[SPEAKER_38]: The intersections I talked about are totally separate than the $2 million.

1469
01:53:51,009 --> 01:53:52,930
[SPEAKER_38]: So I just wanted to bring that up so that way everyone knows.

1470
01:54:01,405 --> 01:54:02,186
[SPEAKER_38]: No, I understand that.

1471
01:54:02,726 --> 01:54:07,989
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, in the 12, yeah.

1472
01:54:08,309 --> 01:54:11,271
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I want you to point out.

1473
01:54:11,491 --> 01:54:13,212
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion, all those in favour?

1474
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:14,673
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1475
01:54:15,474 --> 01:54:15,834
[SPEAKER_25]: Carries.

1476
01:54:19,903 --> 01:54:22,525
[SPEAKER_25]: introduce that paper as you go into executive session?

1477
01:54:22,545 --> 01:54:23,285
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, Mr. President.

1478
01:54:23,305 --> 01:54:27,588
[SPEAKER_31]: I think maybe if there's anybody that has business before the body, we can take care of that.

1479
01:54:27,628 --> 01:54:29,590
[SPEAKER_31]: If there's any, you know, I think we have a traffic license.

1480
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:31,091
[SPEAKER_31]: We have a brief presentation.

1481
01:54:31,151 --> 01:54:33,813
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll be happy to hold my resolutions until the end of the meeting.

1482
01:54:33,893 --> 01:54:43,939
[SPEAKER_31]: But if there are any other members of the general public that are here that want to, I know we have two taxi licenses and we also have three licenses?

1483
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:47,902
[SPEAKER_25]: We have three licenses and we have a presentation from the Energy Commission.

1484
01:54:47,962 --> 01:54:49,143
[SPEAKER_25]: Present yourself to the rail.

1485
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:56,783
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello to take the licenses, petitions, partesans.

1486
01:55:00,465 --> 01:55:08,629
[SPEAKER_25]: On Fish Business to take 15, 571, Cleaning and Dyeing License for Grace Cleaners.

1487
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:11,351
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1488
01:55:11,371 --> 01:55:12,191
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1489
01:55:12,471 --> 01:55:15,273
[SPEAKER_25]: Would the representatives of Grace Cleaners please present themselves?

1490
01:55:15,953 --> 01:55:17,714
[SPEAKER_25]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1491
01:55:18,154 --> 01:55:18,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1492
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:24,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I reviewed the papers from the last meeting, and they are in order.

1493
01:55:25,082 --> 01:55:31,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a customer of Grace Cleaners in West Memphis, and I hope you'll continue to do the same good work that the Grace guys did.

1494
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:34,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion for approval.

1495
01:55:34,808 --> 01:55:36,909
[SPEAKER_09]: A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

1496
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:37,629
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1497
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:40,351
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1498
01:55:40,371 --> 01:55:41,231
[SPEAKER_25]: 570, Mr. President.

1499
01:55:41,611 --> 01:55:43,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion carries.

1500
01:55:43,913 --> 01:55:44,713
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

1501
01:55:44,793 --> 01:55:46,574
[SPEAKER_25]: They're the same people, Mr. President, both of them.

1502
01:55:46,594 --> 01:55:47,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1503
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:52,832
[SPEAKER_25]: 15, 570.

1504
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:52,832
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, the same people for both.

1505
01:55:52,932 --> 01:55:55,334
[SPEAKER_25]: Cleaning drive, dying license, new way cleaners.

1506
01:55:55,554 --> 01:55:56,855
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back.

1507
01:55:57,936 --> 01:55:58,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Come back.

1508
01:55:58,697 --> 01:56:01,719
[SPEAKER_25]: 15, 570 for new way cleaners, so they have two cleaning places.

1509
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:02,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1510
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:03,381
[SPEAKER_25]: You are the rep.

1511
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:04,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1512
01:56:06,003 --> 01:56:06,543
[SPEAKER_00]: The new way?

1513
01:56:08,084 --> 01:56:08,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name and the.

1514
01:56:08,965 --> 01:56:09,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

1515
01:56:10,526 --> 01:56:12,268
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Samuel Pa.

1516
01:56:13,249 --> 01:56:16,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And new way located in 471 High Street.

1517
01:56:18,997 --> 01:56:19,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1518
01:56:19,978 --> 01:56:24,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the established papers also, and do find them in order.

1519
01:56:24,781 --> 01:56:26,862
[SPEAKER_25]: A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

1520
01:56:26,882 --> 01:56:27,623
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1521
01:56:28,203 --> 01:56:29,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

1525
01:56:46,996 --> 01:56:47,917
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caviello?

1526
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:50,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1527
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:55,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I review this gentleman's papers and also find them in order.

1528
01:56:56,429 --> 01:57:00,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you, do you know where the Citywide Taxi's office is?

1529
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:01,850
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 Canal Street, Medford.

1530
01:57:02,030 --> 01:57:03,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is it?

1531
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 Canal Street, Medford.

1532

[SPEAKER_09]: 40 Canal Street, Medford.

1533
01:57:06,991 --> 01:57:10,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I review this gentleman's paperwork and find them in order also.

1534
01:57:10,952 --> 01:57:14,113
[SPEAKER_09]: On motion of Councilor Caravelle for approval, all those in favor?

1535
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, Councilor Pinto wishes to be recorded as opposed.

1536
01:57:25,765 --> 01:57:28,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Because we do not have a taxi ordinance update.

1537
01:57:28,087 --> 01:57:29,988
[SPEAKER_25]: These are for drivers, not a taxi company.

1538
01:57:30,989 --> 01:57:31,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

1539
01:57:31,909 --> 01:57:33,651
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations on your approval, sir.

1540
01:57:33,831 --> 01:57:34,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1541
01:57:34,952 --> 01:57:35,472
[SPEAKER_25]: Drive safely.

1542
01:57:35,632 --> 01:57:36,893
[SPEAKER_25]: Two hands on the wheel, please.

1543
01:57:36,913 --> 01:57:37,734
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1544
01:57:49,717 --> 01:57:55,059
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion to resort back to the regular order of business by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1545
01:57:55,079 --> 01:57:58,321
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1546
01:57:58,341 --> 01:57:58,421
[SPEAKER_25]: 15584 and 15585.

1547
01:57:58,521 --> 01:58:01,502
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Caviello, the first one.

1548
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:15,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council would like to allow the Medford Energy Committee to address the council about the upcoming Energy Festival to inform residents, businesses, and community organizations on the process of how the awards will be chosen for this year's event.

1549
01:58:16,309 --> 01:58:19,030
[SPEAKER_25]: And 585, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved

1550
01:58:19,454 --> 01:58:22,837
[SPEAKER_25]: that a representative from Medford's Energy Committee be recognized.

1551
01:58:23,197 --> 01:58:27,119
[SPEAKER_25]: regarding the Green Energy Awards and Harvest Your Energy Festival.

1552
01:58:27,639 --> 01:58:28,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome.

1553
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:29,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1554
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,561
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, councillors.

1555
01:58:30,581 --> 01:58:31,741
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Curtis Tudin.

1556
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:35,443
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 72 Bonner Ave, and I'm a member of the Medford Energy Committee.

1557
01:58:35,503 --> 01:58:43,807
[SPEAKER_23]: For anyone who doesn't know, that's a appointed group of local volunteers who are responsible for being involved with environmental and energy-related projects in the city.

1558
01:58:44,227 --> 01:58:46,168
[SPEAKER_23]: One of those projects is the Medford Green Awards.

1559
01:58:46,228 --> 01:58:52,251
[SPEAKER_23]: And in 2015, like in years past, we think it's very important for any community to recognize leaders who are

1560
01:58:52,768 --> 01:58:56,571
[SPEAKER_23]: especially responsible and go above and beyond in terms of environmental stewardship.

1561
01:58:57,472 --> 01:59:02,257
[SPEAKER_23]: The application forms to be eligible for the award just became available a few weeks ago.

1562
01:59:02,297 --> 01:59:14,968
[SPEAKER_23]: They can be picked up in the Office of Energy Environment here at City Hall, or you can more easily go to gogreenmedford.org, which is the committee's website, and find all the information there about the application as well as every other project that the committee is involved in.

1563
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:24,222
[SPEAKER_23]: So I wanted to take this opportunity tonight to, one, make this project more publicized, and also to pass out the application forms to the counselors themselves.

1564
01:59:24,622 --> 01:59:34,145
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be great for any of you to reach out to people that you find are exemplary environmental or energy-related residents, or maybe you yourselves feel like you deserve an award.

1565
01:59:34,265 --> 01:59:35,425
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd be happy to recognize you.

1566
01:59:35,825 --> 01:59:43,547
[SPEAKER_23]: And this all comes together on October 3rd at the annual, the 6th annual Harvest Your Energy Festival, which is held under the wind turbine at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1567
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,808
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a, I'm sorry, McGlynn Middle School.

1568
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:48,329
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a great event that happens every year.

1569
01:59:48,389 --> 01:59:58,652
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a collection of residents, businesses, and community groups that are basically innovators in the field that help make Medford a very green community, that help make us a leader, really, in the city in that respect.

1570
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,614
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

1571
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:11,780
[SPEAKER_23]: But really, residents, I just want to stress again that you can go greenmedford.org and just really recognize yourselves or recognize someone that you know that goes above and beyond in this respect.

1572
02:00:12,881 --> 02:00:15,022
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1573
02:00:15,522 --> 02:00:16,763
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1574
02:00:16,823 --> 02:00:18,484
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you, Mr. Tudin, for being here.

1575
02:00:18,524 --> 02:00:22,727
[SPEAKER_31]: I think if we all think back to a couple of weeks ago, we saw Curtis here wearing a different hat.

1576
02:00:23,407 --> 02:00:24,308
[SPEAKER_31]: It was a baseball hat.

1577
02:00:24,348 --> 02:00:27,690
[SPEAKER_31]: He's one of our coaches at the Medford High School baseball team, GBL champs.

1578
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:34,271
[SPEAKER_31]: And one of his other functions that he does here is working on the Energy Commission, and he does great work.

1579
02:00:34,892 --> 02:00:36,794
[SPEAKER_31]: Curtis, I'd like to thank you for coming down here this evening.

1580
02:00:36,814 --> 02:00:38,096
[SPEAKER_31]: I appreciate your presentation.

1581
02:00:38,697 --> 02:00:44,124
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd like you to maybe tell us a little bit about the Harvester Energy Fest and how fun it is, because last year I went down there and

1582
02:00:44,745 --> 02:00:47,848
[SPEAKER_31]: I think I bought more light bulbs than I knew what to do with by the time I got out of there.

1583
02:00:47,868 --> 02:00:50,031
[SPEAKER_31]: They had these energy efficient light bulbs at a great price.

1584
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:53,615
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's one of the many great offers you can get.

1585
02:00:53,875 --> 02:00:57,098
[SPEAKER_23]: It's literally over $120 worth of light bulbs for about a $10.

1586
02:00:57,759 --> 02:00:58,920
[SPEAKER_23]: It comes in a really great package.

1587
02:00:59,381 --> 02:01:02,364
[SPEAKER_23]: I try to take advantage of that every single year and it's something that we commonly have.

1588
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:10,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Really, it's a collection of businesses and groups and a lot of different educational groups in the city that are very environmentally oriented.

1589
02:01:10,556 --> 02:01:16,640
[SPEAKER_23]: And last year, I think we had over 100 tables and there were over 400 people who came down and participated in the event.

1590
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:18,982
[SPEAKER_23]: It's hopefully going to be even bigger this year.

1591
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:22,284
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a very busy September and October with a lot of city events going on.

1592
02:01:22,324 --> 02:01:25,206
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is just one of the many great themes.

1593
02:01:25,266 --> 02:01:32,071
[SPEAKER_23]: And the fact that it can happen underneath the wind turbine and really show off alternative energy and energy efficiency in the way the city is a leader.

1594
02:01:32,972 --> 02:01:39,316
[SPEAKER_23]: It's great that the City Council recognizes that, and I especially appreciate you and Councilman Carviello for helping me get on the agenda for this evening.

1595
02:01:39,796 --> 02:01:44,359
[SPEAKER_23]: And really, the rest of your talks this evening were all very interesting, so thanks for that.

1596
02:01:44,959 --> 02:01:45,780
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for your work, Curtis.

1597
02:01:47,521 --> 02:01:49,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, again, I want to thank you.

1598
02:01:49,242 --> 02:01:56,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Being a member of the Chamber of Commerce myself, we've been involved with these awards from day one, and I know how important they are, and I've been down to every one of these festivals.

1599
02:01:57,476 --> 02:02:00,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope — and every year, they keep — they continue to grow and get bigger.

1600
02:02:00,197 --> 02:02:02,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope this year gets bigger than last year's.

1601
02:02:02,378 --> 02:02:09,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, there's a lot of inspiring individuals in this city, and it's important to recognize them because I think it just leads to more and more people being environmentally responsible.

1602
02:02:09,401 --> 02:02:10,721
[SPEAKER_23]: So, meetings like this are great.

1603
02:02:10,741 --> 02:02:11,001
[SPEAKER_23]: So, thank you.

1604
02:02:11,061 --> 02:02:13,182
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1605
02:02:13,202 --> 02:02:16,023
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

1606
02:02:18,224 --> 02:02:18,704
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1607
02:02:18,884 --> 02:02:19,405
[SPEAKER_31]: Thanks, Chris.

1608
02:02:22,746 --> 02:02:25,387
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, is there any other matters before the —

1609
02:02:27,283 --> 02:02:28,404
[SPEAKER_30]: Are the people here to speak on?

1610
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,685
[SPEAKER_29]: Michael Wongo around maybe?

1611
02:02:30,786 --> 02:02:31,186
[SPEAKER_29]: He's doing good.

1612
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:31,327
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi.

1613
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:31,447
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1614
02:02:31,487 --> 02:02:31,607
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1615
02:26:19,135 --> 02:26:21,537
[SPEAKER_25]: Council meeting, all those in favor?

1616
02:26:22,257 --> 02:26:22,937
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1617
02:26:23,538 --> 02:26:32,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion is reconvened, and in our meeting, in the executive session, the matter before us was received and placed on file.

1618
02:26:33,304 --> 02:26:38,027
[SPEAKER_25]: So now we return to the regular order of business.

1619
02:26:38,047 --> 02:26:39,748
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-586 offered by Councilor Knight.

1620
02:26:40,368 --> 02:26:47,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the MBTA take the necessary steps to address cleanliness at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station, Councilor Knight.

1621
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:49,700
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1622
02:26:50,061 --> 02:27:11,846
[SPEAKER_31]: About 97 days ago, I believe, I put a resolution on piggybacking on Councilor Caviello's resolution of about 180 days before that and requesting that the West Medford Commuter Rail Station be beautified in terms of deweeding and the replacement of stanchions along High Street and some other items relative to overall cleanliness and upkeep.

1623
02:27:12,446 --> 02:27:14,727
[SPEAKER_31]: And to date, we have not seen these occur.

1624
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:19,431
[SPEAKER_31]: I've placed a call into the Department of Transportation requesting their assistance on this matter.

1625
02:27:19,471 --> 02:27:27,153
[SPEAKER_31]: However, I ask that my council colleagues support this agenda item in order to have an official paper passed by this body for the MBTA to act on.

1626
02:27:28,374 --> 02:27:28,694
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

1627
02:27:28,734 --> 02:27:30,354
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1628
02:27:30,994 --> 02:27:32,675
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1629
02:27:33,135 --> 02:27:34,135
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion carries.

1630
02:27:34,155 --> 02:27:35,816
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-587 offered by Councilor Knight.

1631
02:27:36,256 --> 02:27:43,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the OCD review the zoning at Wellington Plaza with intent to make recommendations that will promote mixed use

1632
02:27:43,820 --> 02:27:48,042
[SPEAKER_25]: transit-based development, and the creation of affordable housing, Councilor Knight.

1633
02:27:48,603 --> 02:27:49,923
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1634
02:27:51,184 --> 02:28:07,793
[SPEAKER_31]: Over recent months, I've been driving down the corridor of Riverside Avenue, and every time I drive past the Wellington Plaza, I look at it, and I look at it as a potential for great growth, a potential for us to maybe make some zoning changes there and address some of the needs that we have in this community.

1635
02:28:08,553 --> 02:28:10,374
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a very large parcel of land right now.

1636
02:28:10,415 --> 02:28:11,515
[SPEAKER_31]: It's about two stories high.

1637
02:28:13,702 --> 02:28:31,546
[SPEAKER_31]: thinking I think that maybe we can go up a little bit, a couple of more stories, create some commercial space, potentially maybe some tech industry jobs or some office space that might be resulting in the knowledge-based economy, in the health sciences, Mr. President.

1638
02:28:32,126 --> 02:28:38,888
[SPEAKER_31]: But more importantly, I think that we also need to take a look at this opportunity to create affordable housing in our community, affordable housing that's transit-based,

1639
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:44,322
[SPEAKER_31]: affordable housing that can help us reach our quota, because we are not there at this point in time.

1640
02:28:44,982 --> 02:28:58,846
[SPEAKER_31]: And based upon our conversations that we had in our committee of the whole this morning with the issue of the Community Preservation Act, I think there is an underlying concern that the lack of affordability in terms of housing in our community is forcing people out.

1641
02:28:59,566 --> 02:29:01,427
[SPEAKER_31]: And with that being said, there's a need.

1642
02:29:01,467 --> 02:29:06,948
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that transit-based mixed-use development at a location like Wellington Plaza would do a number of things, Mr. President.

1643
02:29:07,008 --> 02:29:08,949
[SPEAKER_31]: First of all, it would increase our commercial tax base.

1644
02:29:09,451 --> 02:29:14,576
[SPEAKER_31]: would allow us to develop more businesses, which would, in turn, allow us to have a broader tax base.

1645
02:29:14,996 --> 02:29:30,491
[SPEAKER_31]: It would also allow us to address the need of affordable housing by creating units there for people that can live with low and moderate income with access to the T, so that they have the ability to get in and out of town, to go to jobs, go to work, have more opportunities than they would have if they weren't based in a development that's further away from transit.

1646
02:29:30,631 --> 02:29:34,355
[SPEAKER_31]: So, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on the council to support this measure.

1647
02:29:34,913 --> 02:29:36,954
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not the first time I've brought an item like this up.

1648
02:29:37,034 --> 02:29:41,575
[SPEAKER_31]: I've discussed this also at the site of, you know, Locust Street, Meadowglen Mall, and Shaw's.

1649
02:29:41,995 --> 02:29:49,978
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think it's a good idea for us to really take a look at our zoning and to come up with a combined use model for us to really capitalize on the space that we have.

1650
02:29:51,038 --> 02:29:51,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1651
02:29:52,098 --> 02:29:53,539
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caravaglio.

1652
02:29:53,819 --> 02:29:54,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1653
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:58,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had the opportunity to talk with some of these people from Boyd Plaza.

1654
02:29:59,081 --> 02:30:03,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I think going down the line, you're going to see that whole front

1655
02:30:05,116 --> 02:30:07,698
[SPEAKER_09]: of the property developed at some point.

1656
02:30:07,738 --> 02:30:20,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I know once they finish the three restaurants there, there's talk of them building on the other side of Century Bank with some more retail and other things.

1657
02:30:20,487 --> 02:30:25,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think going down the line, I think they will be looking for some more mixed use.

1658
02:30:25,531 --> 02:30:29,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were a little hesitant when we asked them about the question about housing.

1659
02:30:30,741 --> 02:30:34,182
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know that they do have more stuff planned going in there going forward.

1660
02:30:34,622 --> 02:30:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think these people who bought it are going to really do a good job there.

1661
02:30:41,224 --> 02:30:41,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1662
02:30:41,584 --> 02:30:42,164
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Knight.

1663
02:30:43,944 --> 02:30:45,905
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I certainly agree that growth is good.

1664
02:30:45,925 --> 02:30:48,946
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're looking at growth here in this area.

1665
02:30:48,966 --> 02:30:50,066
[SPEAKER_31]: We're seeing it.

1666
02:30:50,106 --> 02:30:53,107
[SPEAKER_31]: We're seeing facade improvements go on in the retail aspect.

1667
02:30:53,147 --> 02:30:54,387
[SPEAKER_31]: We're seeing restaurants come in.

1668
02:30:55,207 --> 02:30:57,228
[SPEAKER_31]: But the way I'm looking at this is a little bit broader.

1669
02:30:59,899 --> 02:31:16,789
[SPEAKER_31]: commercial space come in that brings us jobs that are good-paying jobs that pay $80,000, $90,000, $100,000 a year, jobs that are outside the realm of the food service industry, more in the knowledge-based economy, life sciences, and the actual future of where we see job growth in Massachusetts and in the region.

1670
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:20,692
[SPEAKER_31]: So I can understand that they want to build this area out,

1671
02:31:21,277 --> 02:31:26,901
[SPEAKER_31]: and they want to put chain restaurants in there, and they want to put Panera and Smashburger, and that's all well and good, and those are projects that I support.

1672
02:31:27,541 --> 02:31:44,191
[SPEAKER_31]: However, on a larger scale, I think if we're looking at bringing jobs to the community and we're looking at really addressing several concerns about improving our tax base, putting money back into the circular flow of our economy, and having good jobs that provide good wages with good benefits, I think we need to look at it a little differently as opposed to retail.

1673
02:31:44,852 --> 02:31:46,753
[SPEAKER_31]: We really need to take a look at commercial and industry.

1674
02:31:48,248 --> 02:31:49,148
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1675
02:31:49,308 --> 02:31:51,169
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1676
02:31:51,849 --> 02:31:51,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1677
02:31:52,209 --> 02:31:54,389
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1678
02:31:54,409 --> 02:31:54,910
[SPEAKER_25]: Carries.

1679
02:31:54,930 --> 02:32:12,894
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-588 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council meet as a committee of the whole in September 2015, December 2015, March 2016 with the budget director to monitor the current fiscal year's operating budget and to prepare for the next fiscal year's operating budget.

1680
02:32:12,954 --> 02:32:13,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1681
02:32:14,236 --> 02:32:15,176
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1682
02:32:15,997 --> 02:32:18,438
[SPEAKER_31]: Last meeting, we wrapped up our fiscal year's budget.

1683
02:32:18,618 --> 02:32:22,579
[SPEAKER_31]: We approved that budget, and it is now on the books.

1684
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:31,402
[SPEAKER_31]: But there was a lot of debate, a lot of question, a lot of concern about being provided with information, being provided information late, about having questions that need to be answered.

1685
02:32:32,003 --> 02:32:43,487
[SPEAKER_31]: So in looking at the process as a whole, when I took a step back and said, how did this all go, I thought it might make sense for us to meet quarterly with the budget director to talk about what's going on in terms of actual expenditures out of our budget.

1686
02:32:44,129 --> 02:32:54,678
[SPEAKER_31]: and forecasted revenues that we're hoping are coming in, and then also what our needs and priorities are, and how we can better address some of the concerns that were raised through our last two proceedings, Mr. President.

1687
02:32:55,378 --> 02:32:55,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

1688
02:32:55,758 --> 02:32:58,681
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1689
02:32:59,321 --> 02:33:04,486
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1690
02:33:04,546 --> 02:33:05,186
[SPEAKER_25]: Carries.

1691
02:33:05,206 --> 02:33:12,512
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-596 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the location of 5 High Street and the unsightly scaffolding that surrounds the entire building

1692
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:17,482
[SPEAKER_25]: and sidewalk location continues to present a safety and ugly appearance.

1693
02:33:18,063 --> 02:33:25,966
[SPEAKER_25]: And since the city administration has yet to require the building owner to take any corrective action, that an ordinance be established that addresses the problem.

1694
02:33:26,307 --> 02:33:26,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Pinto.

1695
02:33:27,127 --> 02:33:36,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, it's quite obvious that since this, uh, I believe since March of this year, that unsightly, um, issue is in front of us at high street in Medford.

1696
02:33:36,772 --> 02:33:39,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know why our city administration,

1697
02:33:40,257 --> 02:33:43,700
[SPEAKER_11]: is failing to take immediate action, corrective action on this particular.

1698
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:56,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I would like to have the council consider, as soon as this fall comes into place, an ordinance that addresses a situation such as this.

1699
02:33:56,489 --> 02:33:57,970
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the lean and mean program.

1700
02:33:58,710 --> 02:34:03,794
[SPEAKER_11]: If somebody doesn't care for their property, you can go ahead and do it and charge them on this.

1701
02:34:03,854 --> 02:34:06,256
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a situation where I think the city can just go out there

1702
02:34:07,016 --> 02:34:08,757
[SPEAKER_11]: and do what needs to be done.

1703
02:34:08,877 --> 02:34:09,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea.

1704
02:34:09,717 --> 02:34:15,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody in this city knows what is wrong with the building, if anything at all, why that scaffolding is all around the building.

1705
02:34:16,679 --> 02:34:20,741
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just, it's a detriment, a detriment to business, public safety and public health.

1706
02:34:21,301 --> 02:34:31,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So that being said, Mr. President, I would suggest, I'm going to suggest an offer for our September meeting and that we establish an ordinance that addresses situations such as this.

1707
02:34:31,885 --> 02:34:35,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if it was an ongoing problem that just needed a delay in time,

1708
02:34:35,482 --> 02:34:36,442
[SPEAKER_11]: and work was ongoing.

1709
02:34:36,462 --> 02:34:40,183
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one thing, but absolutely no work is being done taking place.

1710
02:34:40,723 --> 02:34:47,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result of that, that just absolutely detours from any kind of advancement in making Metro square look better than what it is right now.

1711
02:34:48,285 --> 02:34:50,025
[SPEAKER_11]: So I move on that motion, Mr. President.

1712
02:34:50,265 --> 02:34:51,205
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you on that motion.

1713
02:34:51,265 --> 02:34:52,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

1714
02:34:52,106 --> 02:34:53,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Councilor.

1715
02:34:53,506 --> 02:35:03,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, uh, I was told by, uh, someone in the construction industry that scaffolding can only be up X amount of so many days before it has to be recertified again by the city.

1716
02:35:03,599 --> 02:35:13,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if our building department is going down there within the time frame that the scaffolding is allowed to be up.

1717
02:35:13,964 --> 02:35:20,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told that once it's put up, you have so many weeks to keep it up there and to fix it and take it down.

1718
02:35:20,486 --> 02:35:28,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's supposed to be certified in a reasonable amount of time, especially when it's up there for that long time.

1719
02:35:28,638 --> 02:35:34,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the way the issue runs itself is that if work is taking place, and it's ongoing, and it's continuing — The President I understand no work taking place.

1720
02:35:34,102 --> 02:35:34,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Sperling There is nothing.

1721
02:35:34,902 --> 02:35:35,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero.

1722
02:35:35,403 --> 02:35:36,784
[SPEAKER_11]: There's absolutely nothing taking place.

1723
02:35:36,824 --> 02:35:44,088
[SPEAKER_11]: As a matter of fact, the other day, for some reason or another, either kids did it or something else, there was a two-by-four plank that fell off the scaffolding.

1724
02:35:44,128 --> 02:35:46,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know how it got up there, whatever it did.

1725
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:48,852
[SPEAKER_11]: But thankfully, nobody got hurt, and it fell down.

1726
02:35:48,952 --> 02:35:53,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So, with that being said — well, beside the audience, Mr. President — strike that.

1727
02:35:53,655 --> 02:35:58,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot to say, I think we move immediately to have the building department take the appropriate legal action.

1728
02:35:58,844 --> 02:36:03,127
[SPEAKER_11]: and our legal department take the appropriate legal action against the landowner on this particular matter.

1729
02:36:03,947 --> 02:36:04,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1730
02:36:04,308 --> 02:36:08,450
[SPEAKER_24]: So as amended by Councillor Penta on the main motion, Councillor Knight.

1731
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:10,231
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1732
02:36:10,271 --> 02:36:12,573
[SPEAKER_31]: And thank you, Councillor Penta, for once again raising this issue.

1733
02:36:13,093 --> 02:36:20,477
[SPEAKER_31]: I did a little investigating on the matter myself, and it's my understanding that a brick fell from the roof of the building as part of the parapet, I guess they call it.

1734
02:36:21,018 --> 02:36:24,440
[SPEAKER_31]: And that scaffolding is not up because they're doing work on the building.

1735
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:28,222
[SPEAKER_31]: That scaffolding is up so no one gets conked on the head by a brick is what my understanding is.

1736
02:36:29,381 --> 02:36:38,207
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that, you know, this is probably an appropriate situation for us to look into the clean it or lean it ordinance that we have in place.

1737
02:36:38,567 --> 02:36:42,109
[SPEAKER_31]: However, I'm going to be with Councilor Penta to run this one 100%.

1738
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:44,571
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care what we do, but we got to do something to get it fixed.

1739
02:36:44,631 --> 02:36:49,915
[SPEAKER_31]: And if it's a public safety issue and it's because bricks are falling down off the top of the building, that needs to be addressed immediately.

1740
02:36:50,695 --> 02:36:56,499
[SPEAKER_31]: In the interim, you know, I think we need to have a building department take a look at it to make sure that there are no public safety concerns that are generally

1741
02:36:58,457 --> 02:37:02,999
[SPEAKER_31]: endangering, passes by, pedestrians and cars and vehicles alike, Mr. President.

1742
02:37:03,019 --> 02:37:05,420
[SPEAKER_31]: So, Councilor Penta, thank you for bringing this resolution forward.

1743
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:06,120
[SPEAKER_31]: I like the approach.

1744
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:08,801
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, if there's nothing on the books, let's put something on the books.

1745
02:37:08,861 --> 02:37:11,382
[SPEAKER_31]: If there is something on the books, then tell us what it is and let's take care of it.

1746
02:37:11,902 --> 02:37:12,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good, Councilor Knight.

1747
02:37:14,203 --> 02:37:14,623
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1748
02:37:14,723 --> 02:37:16,384
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1749
02:37:16,724 --> 02:37:17,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, City Council.

1750
02:37:17,924 --> 02:37:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1751
02:37:19,985 --> 02:37:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize to the Council.

1752
02:37:21,205 --> 02:37:23,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw an article on the landlord there.

1753
02:37:25,987 --> 02:37:27,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Sunday's paper.

1754
02:37:27,788 --> 02:37:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will send it to the city council.

1755
02:37:30,108 --> 02:37:33,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there may be some kind of issue, bankruptcy or something.

1756
02:37:34,410 --> 02:37:49,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the city can look towards taking over the building by eminent domain because the situation looked quite serious and that thing could stay up there forever if the guy is in, or the company is in some kind of trouble financially.

1757
02:37:52,235 --> 02:37:52,595
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1758
02:37:52,756 --> 02:37:54,096
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of council Penta,

1759
02:37:54,569 --> 02:38:01,694
[SPEAKER_25]: As amended by Councilor Penta, the clerk has requested, I apologize, requested to call the roll.

1760
02:38:04,216 --> 02:38:05,857
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Caruso, Councilor Caviello.

1761
02:38:05,877 --> 02:38:06,157
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1762
02:38:06,877 --> 02:38:07,358
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight.

1763
02:38:07,438 --> 02:38:07,718
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1764
02:38:08,198 --> 02:38:09,239
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Longo Kern.

1765
02:38:09,279 --> 02:38:09,359
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1766
02:38:09,859 --> 02:38:11,300
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Marks, Councilor Penta.

1767
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:11,420
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1768
02:38:12,541 --> 02:38:13,302
[SPEAKER_28]: President Del Rosso.

1769
02:38:13,382 --> 02:38:13,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1770
02:38:13,742 --> 02:38:19,086
[SPEAKER_25]: With a vote of five in the affirmative and two absent, the motion carries.

1771
02:38:19,486 --> 02:38:20,607
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

1772
02:38:20,627 --> 02:38:22,548
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-598, offered by Councilor Caviello.

1773
02:38:24,625 --> 02:38:31,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council... Ooh, I apologize.

1774
02:38:31,807 --> 02:38:52,355
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-597, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that upon citizens' request, an explanation be forwarded to the Council and citizens of Medford as to alleged complaints that the Mayor's kiosk parking program, run by the Republic Parking Company from Tennessee, did in fact issue tickets on the 4th of July.

1775
02:38:55,228 --> 02:39:00,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, once again, these out-of-state bounty hunters did exactly what they did on Patriots Day.

1776
02:39:00,491 --> 02:39:01,532
[SPEAKER_11]: They were out there tagging.

1777
02:39:02,132 --> 02:39:04,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a long discussion with our chief of police on this.

1778
02:39:05,435 --> 02:39:08,077
[SPEAKER_11]: He wasn't very happy as to what they were doing.

1779
02:39:08,557 --> 02:39:14,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess most of these tickets, if not all of them, revolved themselves into neighborhood parking areas.

1780
02:39:15,542 --> 02:39:16,823
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just not right.

1781
02:39:16,943 --> 02:39:22,707
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not right for the taxpayers of this community to be subject to this out-of-state company that the mayor decided to bring in.

1782
02:39:23,490 --> 02:39:36,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And just hustle the citizens of this community out of their money, especially on July 4th, one of the sacred holidays that we have in our country, other than Christmas and New Year's and Memorial Day.

1783
02:39:37,657 --> 02:39:38,437
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just wrong.

1784
02:39:38,797 --> 02:39:41,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's obvious that they're in here just for the money.

1785
02:39:41,558 --> 02:39:44,520
[SPEAKER_11]: They really don't care about what our community is all about.

1786
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:47,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just the wrong thing.

1787
02:39:47,861 --> 02:39:51,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope, Mr. President, that we can get the chief of police just to

1788
02:39:51,703 --> 02:39:52,683
[SPEAKER_11]: give us a report back.

1789
02:39:52,763 --> 02:39:56,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I know he said he was going to have a discussion with the Republic Parking Company about this.

1790
02:39:58,145 --> 02:40:07,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And as an aside to this whole thing, a lot of the folks that go to this Republic Parking Company cannot understand why they're not open on a Saturday.

1791
02:40:08,129 --> 02:40:16,713
[SPEAKER_11]: They're running it like a business, and they're tagging people in the business area, but they're not open on a Saturday for anybody to go in there and to resolve any of their problems.

1792
02:40:17,213 --> 02:40:20,574
[SPEAKER_11]: So a dual request here is to have the chief report back and also

1793
02:40:21,015 --> 02:40:26,558
[SPEAKER_11]: to make a request that Republic Park can be opened on a Saturday during regular business hours, Mr. President.

1794
02:40:27,059 --> 02:40:27,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

1795
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:33,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Roll call vote has been required by Councilor Penta, requested by Councilor Penta on this matter as amended.

1796
02:40:33,943 --> 02:40:35,464
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1797
02:40:35,484 --> 02:40:36,165
[SPEAKER_11]: To report back.

1798
02:40:38,386 --> 02:40:39,467
[SPEAKER_11]: To report back, you know.

1799
02:40:46,551 --> 02:40:49,313
[SPEAKER_28]: Councillor Musil, Councillor Karygiannis.

1800
02:40:53,421 --> 02:40:55,101
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1801
02:40:56,362 --> 02:40:58,543
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1802
02:40:58,703 --> 02:40:59,023
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1803
02:40:59,103 --> 02:41:04,626
[SPEAKER_25]: With a vote of five in the affirmative, two absent, the motion carries.

1804
02:41:04,646 --> 02:41:13,730
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-598 offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council look into removing the old payphone stand in front of 29 High Street.

1805
02:41:14,110 --> 02:41:15,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caviello.

1806
02:41:15,431 --> 02:41:16,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1807
02:41:16,511 --> 02:41:19,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with 29 High, there's one in front of Riverside Ave,

1808
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:21,921
[SPEAKER_09]: several of them around the city.

1809
02:41:22,201 --> 02:41:26,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who owns them or who doesn't own them, but they're quite unsightly.

1810
02:41:26,763 --> 02:41:29,464
[SPEAKER_09]: The one at 29 High doesn't even have a top on it.

1811
02:41:29,504 --> 02:41:30,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, oh, there's a piece of metal.

1812
02:41:31,125 --> 02:41:33,866
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one in front of them at the co-op, and there's probably half a dozen.

1813
02:41:34,226 --> 02:41:36,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see if we can maybe take them out.

1814
02:41:36,707 --> 02:41:39,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I don't know who owns them or who doesn't own them.

1815
02:41:39,869 --> 02:41:42,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe refer the paper to the electrical department.

1816
02:41:42,430 --> 02:41:43,890
[SPEAKER_09]: The electrical department, if they could take them out.

1817
02:41:44,231 --> 02:41:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: They're quite unsightly, and I think they're a safety issue also.

1818
02:41:47,678 --> 02:41:50,299
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good, so as amended by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1819
02:41:50,319 --> 02:41:50,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1820
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:51,580
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1821
02:41:52,761 --> 02:41:53,061
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion.

1822
02:41:53,081 --> 02:41:55,522
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-589 offered by Councilor Knight be resolved.

1823
02:41:55,903 --> 02:42:01,966
[SPEAKER_25]: The Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Salvatore DiMeo on his recent passing.

1824
02:42:03,327 --> 02:42:04,627
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1825
02:42:04,787 --> 02:42:08,109
[SPEAKER_31]: And if Councilor Marks were here, I'm sure he'd be signed onto this resolution as well.

1826
02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:14,213
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. DiMeo's son and I were very close friends, his daughter, and Councilor Marks are very close friends.

1827
02:42:14,513 --> 02:42:16,594
[SPEAKER_31]: With that being said, Mr. DiMeo,

1828
02:42:17,112 --> 02:42:23,353
[SPEAKER_31]: passed away recently, unexpectedly, after a short battle with cancer.

1829
02:42:23,773 --> 02:42:28,254
[SPEAKER_31]: And he was actually beating his cancer back and passed away from some complications very recently.

1830
02:42:29,014 --> 02:42:34,436
[SPEAKER_31]: However, it's my hope that this council will join me in extending its deepest and sincere condolences to the family on their loss.

1831
02:42:34,536 --> 02:42:39,417
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. DiMaio was a great person, a great individual, a great family man.

1832
02:42:39,717 --> 02:42:41,037
[SPEAKER_31]: He's lived in Medford a very long time.

1833
02:42:41,077 --> 02:42:44,518
[SPEAKER_31]: He came here from Italy, settled in Medford, and has been here ever since.

1834
02:42:44,578 --> 02:42:46,658
[SPEAKER_31]: He's been a strong member of our community.

1835
02:42:47,265 --> 02:42:52,766
[SPEAKER_31]: He owns multiple properties in the neighborhood, and he's just an all-around great person, Mr. President, and he's going to be missed.

1836
02:42:53,306 --> 02:42:53,686
[SPEAKER_25]: Good man.

1837
02:42:54,426 --> 02:43:05,828
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we could take 15590 together with this, also offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Marie Ruberti on her recent passing.

1838
02:43:06,468 --> 02:43:08,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, again, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1839
02:43:08,849 --> 02:43:16,450
[SPEAKER_31]: And if Councilor Camuso were here this evening, he would be, I'm sure, assigned onto this resolution, as Marie's grandson, John, is very close friends with both of us.

1840
02:43:17,361 --> 02:43:22,045
[SPEAKER_31]: With that being said, Marie's children Giovanni and Nick still live in south Medford.

1841
02:43:23,145 --> 02:43:33,553
[SPEAKER_31]: Marie came over here from Tripoli by way of Italy some 70 plus years ago, Mr. President, and she recently passed away after a brief illness, and she too will sadly be missed.

1842
02:43:34,173 --> 02:43:42,539
[SPEAKER_31]: She was the stalwart of the family, the matriarch of the home, and she did a great job raising her children and her grandchildren, and she will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

1843
02:43:42,559 --> 02:43:46,602
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'd like to have the council join me in extending its deep and sincere condolences to the family.

1844
02:43:47,086 --> 02:43:51,807
[SPEAKER_26]: We could rise for a moment of silence for these two citizens of Medford.

1845
02:44:04,910 --> 02:44:09,231
[SPEAKER_25]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1846
02:44:09,251 --> 02:44:16,332
[SPEAKER_25]: 15-595, petition by Mr. Joseph Figlioni, 5-9 Garfield Avenue, Medford, to address the council

1847
02:44:16,852 --> 02:44:20,433
[SPEAKER_25]: on a vote on lending monies from non-profits to the library.

1848
02:44:21,733 --> 02:44:22,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, welcome.

1849
02:44:23,054 --> 02:44:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, City Council.

1850
02:44:24,014 --> 02:44:26,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass.

1851
02:44:27,795 --> 02:44:34,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-profits in any city, it's hard to get a grasp on how many there are, and I think we should have a directory of them.

1852
02:44:34,477 --> 02:44:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It will help the non-profits.

1853
02:44:35,617 --> 02:44:39,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It would help people understand a little better how they operate.

1854
02:44:39,598 --> 02:44:45,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Our library has wonderful rooms in the back, just as City Hall has rooms that are sometimes available to the public.

1855
02:44:46,830 --> 02:44:54,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be wonderful if nonprofits could utilize the library, have some board meetings there, especially ones that want to be public, say Pop Warner.

1856
02:44:54,417 --> 02:45:00,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's a gardening club or even something more high profile.

1857
02:45:00,603 --> 02:45:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is this, that with all the nonprofits in the city, having a place to congregate, like the library, would be a nice way to have a little

1858
02:45:12,432 --> 02:45:13,513
[SPEAKER_02]: One hand washes the other.

1859
02:45:13,833 --> 02:45:20,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if they invested a little in the library, we talked about the TV station giving a loan to the library and having some space.

1860
02:45:20,657 --> 02:45:29,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if the non-profits congregated, if we had a little non-profit directory, we'd have a better understanding of this aspect of our community.

1861
02:45:30,103 --> 02:45:37,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would help us so that we don't run into problems as we ran into with West Medford Hillside Little League, Medford Community Cablevision, Pop Warner.

1862
02:45:38,497 --> 02:45:42,620
[SPEAKER_02]: having a little bit of transparency in a place where people could, like, hey, I might want to join that club.

1863
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of the councilors are part of some of the civic groups.

1864
02:45:46,482 --> 02:45:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on a whole other level.

1865
02:45:48,364 --> 02:45:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the nonprofits that do things for the community.

1866
02:45:52,306 --> 02:45:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be just nice to have a higher profile.

1867
02:45:55,548 --> 02:45:57,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see the library get more use.

1868
02:45:57,610 --> 02:46:03,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Councilor Caraviello had mentioned the library before, and I think it got me thinking about the library, and I thank him for having brought it up.

1869
02:46:09,750 --> 02:46:11,191
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much, Mr. Viglione.

1870
02:46:12,091 --> 02:46:15,013
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive in place on file, all those in favor?

1871
02:46:15,033 --> 02:46:17,134
[SPEAKER_25]: Opposed?

1872
02:46:17,574 --> 02:46:18,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion carries.

1873
02:46:21,696 --> 02:46:31,341
[SPEAKER_25]: Finally, petitions, communications from the Mayor, 15592, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

1874
02:46:32,141 --> 02:46:37,664
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm

1875
02:46:38,808 --> 02:46:49,575
[SPEAKER_25]: the reappointment of Michael Luongo, who resides at 145 Fourth Street, to the Medford Housing Authority for a five-year term to expire April 8th, 2020.

1876
02:46:52,817 --> 02:46:58,580
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1877
02:46:58,961 --> 02:46:59,761
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1878
02:47:00,622 --> 02:47:01,362
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1879
02:47:01,882 --> 02:47:07,886
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Luongo, who served a few years on that board, and who sent us his resume for consideration.

1880
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:26,645
[SPEAKER_25]: Under suspension, Papers 15-599, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that if, in fact, the mayor has signed a new contract with Comcast, that he furnish a copy to the city council.

1881
02:47:27,865 --> 02:47:28,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Penta.

1882
02:47:29,046 --> 02:47:32,047
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry I was tongue-tied on that one.

1883
02:47:32,207 --> 02:47:36,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the contract was signed on July 1st of this year.

1884
02:47:37,818 --> 02:47:39,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're just finding out about it tonight.

1885
02:47:39,719 --> 02:47:48,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just getting, because it was just scuttlebutt, and we're getting a copy of it here July 21st, 21 days, 20 days after the fact.

1886
02:47:49,563 --> 02:47:54,546
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a shame that this contract, I have absolutely no idea, haven't had a chance to read it.

1887
02:47:55,406 --> 02:48:04,230
[SPEAKER_11]: When the public hearing took place this past May, neither the mayor nor anyone from the Medford City government appeared at that public hearing on behalf of the ratepayers.

1888
02:48:05,070 --> 02:48:06,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the only elected official there.

1889
02:48:07,068 --> 02:48:10,549
[SPEAKER_11]: There were 10 other residents from this community who spoke on their concerns.

1890
02:48:10,730 --> 02:48:15,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know if their concerns were even incorporated into this contract, for which I've yet to see.

1891
02:48:16,192 --> 02:48:33,359
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact that the mayor has signed a 10-year contract obligating Comcast customers for the next 10 years, when the terms right now are roughly running anywhere from three to five years with cable contracts with renewable options, it just doesn't make any sense.

1892
02:48:34,443 --> 02:48:44,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Since the mayor decided not to hire a new public works director, letting the new mayor come in in January of this year to make that determination, why would he do the same thing for this?

1893
02:48:44,392 --> 02:48:53,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would he obligate the community to a 10-year contract when he has failed to do what he needed to do regarding public access here in this community?

1894
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:57,903
[SPEAKER_11]: We're sitting on over $330,000 in public access money.

1895
02:48:58,484 --> 02:49:02,467
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never received the financial reports from the old Channel 3 station.

1896
02:49:02,958 --> 02:49:11,523
[SPEAKER_11]: never received the minutes, never received the documents from the State Attorney General's office, never from the Secretary of State's office.

1897
02:49:11,783 --> 02:49:17,187
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't even know if Channel 3 has been dissolved or not, whether it's been accepted to be dissolved or whether it's legally dissolved.

1898
02:49:17,207 --> 02:49:18,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea.

1899
02:49:19,368 --> 02:49:28,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I will address further on, because I'm just getting this document here tonight on peg access, where it sits and where it fits in here in this particular document.

1900
02:49:29,274 --> 02:49:30,955
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just a damn shame that

1901
02:49:31,781 --> 02:49:43,424
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole facade of hiring Mr. Peter Epstein from Boston, I believe he gets paid $325 an hour to sit before this community on, I believe, a Wednesday afternoon with 10 folks, including myself.

1902
02:49:43,864 --> 02:49:56,168
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here to testify, to give our reasons, and not knowing whether any of those reasons were addressed, whether a bona fide research, or even acknowledged to be part of the document that we have before us.

1903
02:49:56,931 --> 02:50:11,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyone who might be a rate payer out there, the only thing I can tell you is, unfortunately, this administration, this mayor, has tied up, once again, your cable contract for 10 years with Comcast, not knowing whether to be bad, good, or indifferent.

1904
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:20,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the requests were made that the issuing authority go to the legislative body, as they do in a lot of communities, and not to the executive authority.

1905
02:50:20,244 --> 02:50:22,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way, the public hearings would be able to take place.

1906
02:50:22,965 --> 02:50:25,847
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd be able to have an opportunity to talk about it and discuss it.

1907
02:50:26,253 --> 02:50:32,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'd have more of a reasonable interpretation and transparency as to what could be in your cable rate, in your cable bill.

1908
02:50:32,816 --> 02:50:34,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is going to cause you an increase.

1909
02:50:35,077 --> 02:50:37,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if the senior citizens are going to be addressed.

1910
02:50:37,479 --> 02:50:39,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if low-income people are going to be addressed.

1911
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:45,623
[SPEAKER_11]: All these things were issues that were brought up at the public hearing this past May.

1912
02:50:46,263 --> 02:50:54,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, again, it's another sad day for ratepayers in this community being saddled with a new 10-year contract.

1913
02:50:55,096 --> 02:51:01,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And this mayor is just riding off into the sunset, leaving this community without even knowing what the options might be.

1914
02:51:01,558 --> 02:51:02,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, he signed it.

1915
02:51:02,938 --> 02:51:03,498
[SPEAKER_11]: He delivered it.

1916
02:51:03,798 --> 02:51:05,178
[SPEAKER_11]: This council wasn't apprised of it.

1917
02:51:05,839 --> 02:51:07,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The ratepayers weren't apprised of it.

1918
02:51:08,339 --> 02:51:10,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're saddled with another 10-year contract.

1919
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:14,801
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't speak well for government interpretation with the customer.

1920
02:51:15,501 --> 02:51:15,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1921
02:51:16,301 --> 02:51:17,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counselor.

1922
02:51:17,061 --> 02:51:17,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Caviello.

1923
02:51:18,121 --> 02:51:18,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1924
02:51:19,322 --> 02:51:24,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, a few weeks ago, there was something on one of our agendas

1925
02:51:25,448 --> 02:51:30,171
[SPEAKER_09]: about somebody winning the award for the station.

1926
02:51:30,712 --> 02:51:31,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did that ever go?

1927
02:51:31,512 --> 02:51:38,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the mayor awarded the station to somebody or there was a winning bidder.

1928
02:51:38,897 --> 02:51:41,939
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a winning bidder for the station.

1929
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:46,402
[SPEAKER_25]: That issue was section 22 and never taken off by the sectioner.

1930
02:51:46,422 --> 02:51:47,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.

1931
02:51:49,525 --> 02:51:50,025
[SPEAKER_29]: Counselor Knight.

1932
02:51:50,773 --> 02:52:04,620
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, where the resolution before this body was to have the mayor provide us a copy of the contract if it has, in fact, been signed, and we, before us here, have a signed contract, I think that the request has been met and the paper can be received and placed on file.

1933
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:12,364
[SPEAKER_31]: The gentleman, I'm sure, will do his due diligence and his research and take a look at this contract, and at a later date, I'm sure, bring a paper forward.

1934
02:52:12,484 --> 02:52:16,806
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know if that's the way you want to handle it, counselor, if you want to table the paper and then bring that back to life at a later date.

1935
02:52:20,022 --> 02:52:40,188
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole idea of having this was, it was scuttled, but at the time that I sent my resolution to be on the agenda for this week, and now knowing tonight when Mr. Finn turned around and said he had copies of it already prepared, and I'd seen the city solicitor early, and he had indicated, you know, if you want it electronically through email, but I'd rather have the hard copy.

1936
02:52:40,228 --> 02:52:45,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad we got it, but the sad, the disturbing part about this is, once again,

1937
02:52:45,688 --> 02:52:48,231
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, why would the mayor sign a 10-year contract?

1938
02:52:48,591 --> 02:52:52,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly all the cities and towns are into three to five-year contracts.

1939
02:52:52,175 --> 02:52:52,815
[SPEAKER_11]: That's number one.

1940
02:52:52,855 --> 02:53:00,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And number two, having no input into this other than the make-believe dog and pony show that took place here in May.

1941
02:53:00,977 --> 02:53:05,218
[SPEAKER_11]: hiring an attorney to come in here and just elicit commentaries.

1942
02:53:05,338 --> 02:53:09,480
[SPEAKER_11]: You could hire our own city solicitor to come in to do it, or the assistant city solicitor.

1943
02:53:10,060 --> 02:53:12,421
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't even know if any of these things are incorporated in here.

1944
02:53:12,441 --> 02:53:14,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And the hour is what?

1945
02:53:14,441 --> 02:53:14,941
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 past 10.

1946
02:53:15,001 --> 02:53:18,162
[SPEAKER_11]: We just get this thing at approximately 10 o'clock tonight and to review it.

1947
02:53:18,663 --> 02:53:20,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to review it, bring it up at another time.

1948
02:53:20,963 --> 02:53:22,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do it as a separate paper?

1949
02:53:22,904 --> 02:53:24,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, do it as a separate paper.

1950
02:53:24,704 --> 02:53:26,205
[SPEAKER_11]: We can receive this and place it on file.

1951
02:53:26,225 --> 02:53:29,646
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact of the matter is, this does not bode well

1952
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:36,882
[SPEAKER_11]: for cable TV subscribers who have Comcast, who's probably been rated one of the worst companies in the country to deal business with.

1953
02:53:37,183 --> 02:53:38,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not from me.

1954
02:53:38,363 --> 02:53:39,864
[SPEAKER_11]: That's from the Wall Street people.

1955
02:53:41,424 --> 02:53:44,545
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of council, I'll deny it to receive and place on file.

1956
02:53:45,125 --> 02:53:46,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Citizen wishes to speak.

1957
02:53:46,606 --> 02:53:47,086
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1958
02:53:47,166 --> 02:53:48,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1959
02:53:49,247 --> 02:53:49,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

1960
02:53:49,687 --> 02:53:52,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1961
02:53:52,968 --> 02:53:57,110
[SPEAKER_02]: As people here can recall, I found the letter from Timothy

1962
02:53:59,210 --> 02:54:02,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Timothy over at Comcast that the mayor got in December.

1963
02:54:03,594 --> 02:54:04,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Timothy Kelly, thank you very much.

1964
02:54:05,756 --> 02:54:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of blues hammers when you're 61 years old, you know.

1965
02:54:08,838 --> 02:54:10,660
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tim Kelly at Comcast.

1966
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I should know that name like the back of my hand.

1967
02:54:14,643 --> 02:54:15,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know about it.

1968
02:54:15,364 --> 02:54:16,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We were not apprised of it.

1969
02:54:16,345 --> 02:54:19,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I did receive this Comcast contract on Friday.

1970
02:54:19,807 --> 02:54:24,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Janice Spencer, wonderful woman in the solicitor's office, gave me the pages I requested.

1971
02:54:25,952 --> 02:54:27,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I had put a public records request in.

1972
02:54:29,062 --> 02:54:32,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And on July 3rd, Mark Grumley wrote me.

1973
02:54:32,903 --> 02:54:35,623
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 17th, I went over to City Hall and got these papers.

1974
02:54:36,463 --> 02:54:45,805
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's very important in this contract, I have been studying section, this is page, not page seven.

1975
02:54:46,785 --> 02:54:53,346
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a part of the Comcast contract, which is article six, starting on page 18.

1976
02:54:53,426 --> 02:54:56,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important, especially for this election.

1977
02:54:59,052 --> 02:55:02,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to take just a minute to read this.

1978
02:55:02,695 --> 02:55:03,315
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.8 censorship.

1979
02:55:03,976 --> 02:55:21,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither the licensee, which is Comcast, or the city and or its designees shall engage in any program censorship or any other control of the content of the peg access programming in the cable system except as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

1980
02:55:21,968 --> 02:55:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what that means is if we have a TV show, it should be aired.

1981
02:55:25,511 --> 02:55:27,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the mayor doesn't have a peg channel,

1982
02:55:27,472 --> 02:55:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: public, it should air on the high school or the government channel.

1983
02:55:29,973 --> 02:55:31,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a TV show called Visual Radio.

1984
02:55:33,234 --> 02:55:34,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we watch it?

1985
02:55:34,715 --> 02:55:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So the censorship clause is very important for every candidate out there and every voter in Medford.

1986
02:55:40,317 --> 02:55:49,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Every voter and every candidate, you go to Mark Rumley with the law and you say, Mr. Rumley, 6.0, 6.8 censorship, page 20.

1987
02:55:50,061 --> 02:55:55,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want Jack Dempsey doing, you know, the videos for the candidates.

1988
02:55:57,054 --> 02:56:00,017
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks before the election, we want a vibrant discussion.

1989
02:56:00,578 --> 02:56:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about this issue for 12 long years in Medford.

1990
02:56:05,483 --> 02:56:06,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We're paying a lot of money.

1991
02:56:06,604 --> 02:56:13,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe when this contract was signed, a balloon payment triggered not only from Comcast, but additionally from Verizon.

1992
02:56:13,811 --> 02:56:20,098
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read the Verizon contract, which is in the city clerk's office, I think you will see there's a balloon payment from Verizon that goes

1993
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:23,321
[SPEAKER_02]: simultaneous with this.

1994
02:56:24,081 --> 02:56:25,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very important.

1995
02:56:25,381 --> 02:56:26,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are.

1996
02:56:26,562 --> 02:56:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor signed the contract.

1997
02:56:27,722 --> 02:56:28,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't let us know about it.

1998
02:56:29,003 --> 02:56:30,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have his public hearing.

1999
02:56:30,623 --> 02:56:31,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the people.

2000
02:56:32,324 --> 02:56:33,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in our hand.

2001
02:56:34,584 --> 02:56:35,905
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a censorship issue here.

2002
02:56:36,645 --> 02:56:38,506
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor had chose to be the issuing authority.

2003
02:56:38,606 --> 02:56:42,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the city council should be the issuing authority in Winchester.

2004
02:56:42,627 --> 02:56:44,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the selectmen, not the town manager.

2005
02:56:44,888 --> 02:56:46,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a critical issue.

2006
02:56:46,549 --> 02:56:48,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did the mayor choose to be issuing authority?

2007
02:56:48,729 --> 02:56:50,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't the council vote on this?

2008
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:51,640
[SPEAKER_02]: censorship.

2009
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:52,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an election.

2010
02:56:52,361 --> 02:56:54,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 104 days away.

2011
02:56:55,223 --> 02:56:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put together a quick access station.

2012
02:56:57,985 --> 02:57:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I just told Louise Miller outside we can get a backpack.

2013
02:57:01,467 --> 02:57:04,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It can transmit on cellular lines and go right to Channel three.

2014
02:57:05,350 --> 02:57:06,971
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be done efficiently.

2015
02:57:06,991 --> 02:57:08,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it in my sleep.

2016
02:57:08,752 --> 02:57:10,393
[SPEAKER_02]: As I told the mayor, I saw him a few weeks ago.

2017
02:57:10,413 --> 02:57:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Your Honor, I could put it together in my sleep.

2018
02:57:13,015 --> 02:57:19,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as for the award of the infrastructure at the high school station, yes, Mr Payette was awarded

2019
02:57:20,197 --> 02:57:22,979
[SPEAKER_02]: the infrastructure and that's happening.

2020
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:28,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just talked to Louise Miller and the mayor wants to put peg access at the high school.

2021
02:57:28,905 --> 02:57:31,527
[SPEAKER_02]: He has decided to have the high school oversee it.

2022
02:57:31,907 --> 02:57:33,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the transcript this week.

2023
02:57:33,148 --> 02:57:35,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Alex can probably speak about it eloquently.

2024
02:57:36,291 --> 02:57:39,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Louise Miller told me, yes, the mayor has decided to put it at the high school.

2025
02:57:39,934 --> 02:57:40,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go, people.

2026
02:57:48,490 --> 02:57:57,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, before we move to the question, if the gentleman at the podium is correct, once again, why do we have to hear this from a citizen if the mayor is already making a determination?

2027
02:58:02,498 --> 02:58:04,939
[SPEAKER_29]: Councillor Camuso brought this issue up two weeks ago, and it got sectioned.

2028
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:06,420
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't think we're hearing it from a citizen.

2029
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:09,422
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we were going to hear it from one of our councillors, and then the matter got sectioned.

2030
02:58:09,702 --> 02:58:11,003
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't able to be brought to the table.

2031
02:58:11,403 --> 02:58:12,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear what you're saying.

2032
02:58:12,284 --> 02:58:15,045
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact of the matter is Councillor Camuso is not the mayor in this community.

2033
02:58:15,085 --> 02:58:18,207
[SPEAKER_11]: If the mayor is making a determination with the high school and the contractor,

2034
02:58:18,497 --> 02:58:29,179
[SPEAKER_11]: this council which has been asking week after week, month after month, to be apprised as to what's going on, and we have to hear it from citizens in the newspaper once again to read about it, that that's wrong.

2035
02:58:29,519 --> 02:58:30,620
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not transparency.

2036
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:31,680
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not communication.

2037
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:37,361
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the mayor once again just doing whatever he wants when he wants, and it's wrong.

2038
02:58:37,461 --> 02:58:38,922
[SPEAKER_11]: It's absolutely wrong.

2039
02:58:43,222 --> 02:58:44,263
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I want to report back.

2040
02:58:44,283 --> 02:58:45,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to report back from the mayor.

2041
02:58:46,145 --> 02:58:50,466
[SPEAKER_11]: If in fact that's true, what is the mayor intending to do with peg access up at the high school?

2042
02:58:53,166 --> 02:58:54,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote on that.

2043
02:58:54,207 --> 02:58:56,827
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me ask this question before.

2044
02:58:57,227 --> 02:58:57,327
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2045
02:59:20,890 --> 02:59:21,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2046
02:59:25,871 --> 02:59:34,472
[SPEAKER_25]: The papers were passed.

2047
02:59:34,492 --> 02:59:38,833
[SPEAKER_25]: The records of the June 30th, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

2048
02:59:39,073 --> 02:59:39,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Where did you get three?

2049
02:59:40,433 --> 02:59:40,893
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to table.

2050
02:59:40,913 --> 02:59:41,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, where did you get three?

2051
02:59:41,974 --> 02:59:43,214
[SPEAKER_11]: How did you count those votes again?

2052
02:59:44,234 --> 02:59:45,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Three to two.

2053
02:59:46,254 --> 02:59:46,614
[SPEAKER_21]: You won.

2054
02:59:48,595 --> 02:59:48,975
[SPEAKER_21]: We won.

2055
02:59:49,575 --> 02:59:49,815
[SPEAKER_21]: You won?

2056
02:59:50,681 --> 02:59:51,522
[SPEAKER_21]: With two absences.

2057
02:59:51,582 --> 02:59:52,042
[SPEAKER_21]: It passed.

2058
02:59:52,122 --> 02:59:52,922
[SPEAKER_21]: It didn't fail.

2059
02:59:53,423 --> 02:59:54,143
[SPEAKER_28]: It passed.

2060
02:59:55,164 --> 02:59:56,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It passed.

2061
02:59:57,025 --> 02:59:57,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Three to two.

2062
03:00:00,027 --> 03:00:02,829
[SPEAKER_28]: You need four votes.

2063
03:00:03,869 --> 03:00:04,750
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people are here?

2064
03:00:04,790 --> 03:00:07,311
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a majority of those attending a meeting.

2065
03:00:08,812 --> 03:00:10,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't say the word minimum.

2066
03:00:10,974 --> 03:00:12,955
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a majority of those attending, I believe.

2067
03:00:16,608 --> 03:00:18,649
[SPEAKER_31]: Four members of the city council shall constitute a quorum.

2068
03:00:18,689 --> 03:00:21,109
[SPEAKER_31]: A committee of the whole meeting shall be postponed if a quorum is not present.

2069
03:00:29,272 --> 03:00:33,853
[SPEAKER_31]: The affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected to the council shall be necessary for the passage.

2070
03:00:36,174 --> 03:00:40,475
[SPEAKER_31]: The affirmative vote of the majority of the members present shall be sufficient to adjourn any meeting of the council.

2071
03:00:40,495 --> 03:00:44,656
