67
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:33,332
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had robust discussion.

68
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:37,755
[SPEAKER_12]: There has been more communications, emails sent by the mayor.

69
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:42,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe Councilor Lemming has had some conversations with the mayor.

70
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:44,640
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to turn over to Councilor Lemming.

71
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We also did receive a communication at some point today which I have printed in front of me.

72
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:55,585
[SPEAKER_12]: I have it here, yeah.

00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:56,866

81
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:52,302
[SPEAKER_12]: This would be if that vote was taken.

82
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:56,725
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor and city council agreed on a plan to restart the city zoning updates project.

83
00:43:56,785 --> 00:44:05,832
[SPEAKER_12]: The city will sign an extension and provide additional resources to advance key zoning priorities in Medford square, Tufts and Boston Ave between now and May, 2026.

84
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:08,854
[SPEAKER_12]: The city will solicit new proposals starting in February, March

85
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:15,657
[SPEAKER_12]: for work on zoning updates between May 2026 and June 2028 with a one-year extension, if not complete.

86
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:26,302

[SPEAKER_12]: The Mayor will additionally request that the City Council and Community Development Board hold a joint public hearing in January to discuss the rezoning proposal for Medford Square and West Medford Square that is currently sitting in the Community Development Board.

89
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:54,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Following this, a request for proposals for a new contract

90
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:00,042

98
00:45:39,064 --> 00:45:43,325
[SPEAKER_12]: The map released by the Community Development Board from May 2025 will not be the starting point.

99
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:46,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Parking will take place at the same time as residential zoning.

100

103
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:11,886
[SPEAKER_12]: The council and the mayor will work together on whether or not this should be a standalone RFP.

104
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,307
[SPEAKER_12]: No new zoning amendments will be presented during July and August.

105
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:18,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Department heads will be consulted from the beginning on all of the above.

106
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:26,415
[SPEAKER_12]: At the December 2nd meeting, the council voted to rezone parts of the Salem Park node from MX2 to MX1 following a September request from the mayor.

107
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,217
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the full draft.

108
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:38,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you Councilor Lemming for working on it and I will turn it over to you and then we can go to discussion from the council and then we'll reopen the public hearing.

109
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:39,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lemming.

110
00:46:40,713 --> 00:46:40,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

111
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:44,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Council President Behrs.

112
00:46:45,194 --> 00:47:08,042
[SPEAKER_13]: This, following the last city council meeting where members of this body requested that the full agreement be written out in detail and sent out in a press release, I worked with the mayor and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on hammering out the

113
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:18,486
[SPEAKER_13]: exact wording of a press release so that we can then vote to endorse it.

114
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:23,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Subsequently, the mayor and the communications team will release it.

115
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:27,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this will make it clear what

116
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:36,819
[SPEAKER_13]: with what the rezoning process will entail moving forward.

117
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:46,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a consistent pattern in this process that pretty much everybody has agreed upon is that communication has been lacking both within

118
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:54,108
[SPEAKER_13]: City Hall and among the general public.

119
00:47:54,849 --> 00:48:09,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And having a press release coming from the mayor and endorsed by the city council will go a long ways towards building trust in the process moving forward.

120
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:14,274
[SPEAKER_13]: And it will also give us something to point to regarding sort of what we agreed upon.

121
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:26,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that individual members of this council in the preceding meetings have made it very clear what their

122
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,742
[SPEAKER_13]: views on this are individually.

123
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:42,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not gonna speak for anybody else here, but I personally feel like this, what's written out here does provide us with a very solid framework moving forward.

124
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:49,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank the mayor's office for working with me on it.

125
00:48:50,220 --> 00:49:13,858
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of moving forward, I would, I'm not sure if we would have to motion to close the public hearing first, but I would motion to, I think that the two motions would be to approve the amendment and then follow, and then contingent upon its approval, motion for a B paper to endorse the wording of this proposal as well.

126
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:23,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just procedurally we have to reopen the public hearing and then we'll close the public hearing and then we would have to vote on any B paper before voting on the main paper.

127
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:30,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, so we'd have to vote to endorse this prior to the actual Salem Street?

128
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:30,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

129
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:31,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, okay.

130
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:32,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Well.

131
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:38,512
[SPEAKER_12]: But we can get there once we've done the, once we've closed the public hearing, I'll take the motions.

132
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:38,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotcha.

133
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:39,372
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

134
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:39,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

135
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:41,313
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I have to say.

136
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:41,953
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

137
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:46,968
[SPEAKER_12]: to Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Lazaro, then Council Vice President Collins.

138
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:47,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

139
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:48,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

140
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:54,953
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Council, I believe that we were talking about the press release going public first before we did.

141
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,154
[SPEAKER_15]: We went through any votes, correct?

142
00:49:57,214 --> 00:50:04,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that we wanted it to go public so people can chime in and bring us back to where we were.

143
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:11,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's one of the things we talked about is having people see what the mayor is saying and then people can

144
00:50:12,187 --> 00:50:19,633
[SPEAKER_15]: look into this and then as part of the process that we've talked about being communicated and making sure that everybody sees the process.

145
00:50:19,693 --> 00:50:22,375
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so I wasn't expecting for a vote for that tonight.

146
00:50:22,415 --> 00:50:35,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I was expecting to vote on the press release going out to the public and then at our next meeting, uh, receiving any of the feedback that we have from the residents in that, and especially in the Salem street area that have been reaching out to us.

147
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:37,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so,

148
00:50:38,613 --> 00:50:40,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that that's the way to go.

149
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:46,916
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, I was not part of the negotiations.

150
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:47,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

151
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:49,897
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't either, so.

152
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:59,021
[SPEAKER_12]: From reading this, it seems like the mayor is saying that she's only willing to put out a press release after a vote, but I'll let Councilor Lemming talk about that.

153
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:00,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

154
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:03,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I should say that this was hammered out between

155
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,161
[SPEAKER_13]: between the two of us, and I fully understand what you're saying.

156
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:25,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there is a bit of a chicken and egg issue where we would want the press release to go out and then vote on it, but the mayor would sort of want it the other way around, and it's just a matter of the body's not really.

157
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:27,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there is a matter of trust between the bodies.

158
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:36,313
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I propose, and this proposal did come from me, so, was to pass it and then if, well,

159
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:56,581
[SPEAKER_13]: we did end up voting in favor of the amendment, then vote to endorse this press release, assuming that members of this council wanted the press, like, endorse the wording of the press release.

160
00:51:56,621 --> 00:52:00,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So, again, I think that, I fully hear what you're saying.

161
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:07,725
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was, I think there was a bit of a chicken and egg issue going on there, and I,

162
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:15,891
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll say that the press release went out tonight.

163
00:52:16,651 --> 00:52:24,815
[SPEAKER_13]: The press release only got to us in a draft form today, so we didn't have, individuals didn't have too much time to review it.

164
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:36,146
[SPEAKER_13]: What I will say is that for this, in this particular case, this was the result of me actually trying to work with the administration on this.

165
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:44,031
[SPEAKER_13]: So at least there is one member of the body trying to be, you know, we are trying to be a little bit collaborative in this case.

166
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:51,276
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would be interested in hearing from my colleagues on what their opinions on the process should be moving forward.

167
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:53,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

168
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:56,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate

169
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:08,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lemming, you know, reaching out and being that olive branch, I think that we all want to see this move forward one way or the other so we can get to a resolution.

170
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:22,574
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that, you know, it's the who's on first game where, again, this is where we vote on something tonight without getting the input of what has been publicly released.

171
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,676
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it comes back to the council saying, there you go again.

172
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:35,709
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked for a transparent and open form of government, but we're doing something privately because we've heard that a thousand times the last couple of weeks, right?

173
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:40,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything's being done in a bubble and even the council doesn't know what's going on at times.

174
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:42,553
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know.

175
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:54,380
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I can support it, a vote until, I would vote to move the press release to go public, but I, you know,

176
00:53:56,885 --> 00:54:06,117
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm gathering she wants us to vote on, I don't know, I'm talking into riddles right now.

177
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:09,321
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I need to, yeah, go ahead if you can, yeah.

178
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:12,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we can go around or, go ahead Matt, Councilman.

179
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:14,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I could, well, yeah, sorry.

180
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:25,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I do appreciate what you're saying with wanting to get feedback from residents on what the process ought to be.

181
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:39,752
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will repeat, I think it does become a bit of a chicken and egg issue because if the press release were phrased in such a way that, I don't know, I do think it would be,

182
00:54:42,205 --> 00:54:53,292
[SPEAKER_13]: a bit odd to release, to give out a press release with like a details of what the rezoning process could be and say this is, this is just one draft, this is just one possibility the way things could go.

183
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:57,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Please residents come back and, you know, tell us, tell us what you, what you think it should be.

184
00:54:57,875 --> 00:55:01,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I. Yeah.

185
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:03,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

186
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and I think just, you know, we're approving this draft release.

187
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:10,663
[SPEAKER_12]: We then have to have a meeting.

188
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,210
[SPEAKER_12]: on the substance of it, both the.

189
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:17,534
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to have a meeting to restart the first phase of that process.

190
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:19,154
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to have a meeting on writing the RFP.

191
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:20,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's room for engagement.

192
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:33,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to see, to be honest, like maybe in this first phase that some of the communication support would be talking about the meeting about the RFP for the second phase, you know.

193
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:34,820
[SPEAKER_12]: But I agree with you.

194
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:41,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my personal preference was also that a public statement was made before it came back to us.

195
00:55:41,562 --> 00:55:43,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems like that wasn't where we ended up.

196
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:44,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

197
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:45,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

198
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:46,325
[SPEAKER_12]: But I hear you.

199
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:47,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear you.

200
00:55:47,466 --> 00:55:47,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

201
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:47,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

202
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:50,450
[SPEAKER_12]: And good counseling.

203
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

204
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:21,530
[SPEAKER_13]: The other point, and I should just say the reason that I kind of do want to get this done tonight is in full transparency, the CDB, they have a meeting on the residential rezoning proposal on December 17th, which they only have because it was delayed from the last time it was discussed, I believe,

205
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:40,318
[SPEAKER_13]: June or July, and I would, if we get this published, which essentially is an agreement between the council and the mayor that we're then showing to the public on how this project will move forward, then I would

206
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that provides us like a little bit of, you know, solid ground on which we can proceed.

207
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:56,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would like to then submit a resolution at the next meeting to actually withdraw that resolution, to actually withdraw the residential rezoning proposal from the CDB.

208
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,397
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

209
00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:01,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

210
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:01,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

211
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean I think that sounds like a path forward.

212
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:06,268
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a start.

213
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:08,010
[SPEAKER_12]: As I read this, it's a starting point.

214
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:14,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Details to come in terms of some of the, we're not saying exactly when everything's going to happen.

215
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:15,496
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still a framework.

216
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:16,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazaro.

217
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

218
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:29,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say thank you to the Mayor's Office, the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office, and Councilor Lemming for hammering out the details of this.

219
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:35,875
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a lot of different people with a lot of different requests being made over a period of time.

220
00:57:36,976 --> 00:57:40,499
[SPEAKER_07]: on this topic and it's very easy for it to get muddy.

221
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:50,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just appreciate that everybody was coming together and trying to figure out how to move forward on this project in a way that was cohesive.

222
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm comfortable moving forward with this.

223
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:54,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I've said everything I had to say.

224
00:57:55,715 --> 00:58:01,818
[SPEAKER_07]: on the topic and I feel good about where we landed based on what we have here.

225
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:08,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you said, being able to hammer out the details as we move forward, I think it's still, it's still, that's still available to us.

226
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's fine.

227
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:11,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much again.

228
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:13,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Lozano.

229
00:58:14,003 --> 00:58:14,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins.

230
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:19,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Behrs.

231
00:58:20,249 --> 00:58:22,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the discussion around this.

232
00:58:23,014 --> 00:58:25,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to see this reach this point.

233
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:30,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to thank Councilor Lemming for bringing it home, so to speak.

234
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:32,169
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of conversations about this for the past...

235
00:58:33,837 --> 00:58:47,106
[SPEAKER_00]: over our two meetings in November and I think I've made it pretty clear in our past two meetings and in my private conversations with the mayor my list of needs things that I needed to see to

236
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:58,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Not things that I needed to see to be able to support the Salem Street Amendment because I do support that and I was ready to vote yes on that but things that I need to see in order to take that vote at all.

237
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:08,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've closed a lot of distance between where she started and my list of needs and other counselors lists of needs.

238
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:17,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy to see that and I'm glad we've gotten to the point where we can take the vote on the Salem Street Amendment and be done with that.

239
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:30,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm even more glad that we've reached the point where we can say with certainty to the community that has been invested in visioning the future of planning in Medford for five years and that has been invested in conversations about rezoning in Medford.

240
00:59:30,822 --> 00:59:33,925
[SPEAKER_00]: for two years that yes, we have a confirmed path forward.

241
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,867
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a, to me, this is a public commitment.

242
00:59:37,568 --> 00:59:38,629
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yet a press release.

243
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:40,971
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be, but it's public record now.

244
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:48,558
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very important to me to be able to see, to be able to, that was a critical ingredient for me to be able to take a vote on the Salem Street Amendment.

245
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:53,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frankly, I've said this before, but I'll say it again.

246
00:59:53,479 --> 00:59:56,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the city council's approach has been collaborative throughout this process.

247
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that city staff's approach has been collaborative throughout this process.

248
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:03,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that collaboration breakdown has been in the mayor's office.

249
01:00:03,702 --> 01:00:05,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why we had to say,

250
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:15,131
[SPEAKER_00]: We will, we have to retain this chip of leverage that we have until we get a guarantee from your office that you will collaborate with us going forward.

251
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:16,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry that we had to play it like that.

252
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:22,317
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you look at where we started six weeks ago or back in late July and where we are now.

253
01:00:25,803 --> 01:00:26,604
[SPEAKER_00]: the proof is in the pudding.

254
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:33,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate my fellow counselors for sticking their necks out for a process that is what the community deserves.

255
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:43,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy that we'll be able to jointly publish this press release and be able to say the community, we will really, we'll hammer out the details later.

256
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:53,047
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hammer out the details in January and February, but we will be crafting an RFP that unlike the last one, we'll ask for,

257
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:59,781
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate resources for community engagement and communications and public participation.

258
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:04,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll cover all of these topics without rushing and with less confusion.

259
01:01:05,004 --> 01:01:06,905
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what the community has been asking for.

260
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:08,226
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what the community deserves.

261
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:15,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am really excited to see what that looks like over the next two or three years.

262
01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:16,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

263
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:19,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

264
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Any more comments or questions from members of the council?

265
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:26,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none at this time, I'm gonna reopen the public hearing.

266
01:01:26,827 --> 01:01:32,656
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're here in person and you'd like to speak on this topic, this is the proposed amendment for Salem Street zoning.

267
01:01:32,696 --> 01:01:35,862
[SPEAKER_12]: You can come to the podium or if you're on Zoom, you can raise your hand.

268
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:37,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Public hearing is open.

269
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:48,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing one hand, and I will go there in just a second.

270
01:01:48,144 --> 01:01:55,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to note this is our third meeting of this continued public hearing, and we have had several people speak on this in previous public hearings.

271
01:01:57,286 --> 01:02:09,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me one second, Micah.

272
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:14,271
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

273
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:18,028
[SPEAKER_12]: name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

274
01:02:19,629 --> 01:02:21,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Kesselman 499 Main Street.

275
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:33,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that I'm glad to see that this is finally coming to closure after a long and arduous back and forth.

276
01:02:33,276 --> 01:02:36,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to

277
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,508
[SPEAKER_09]: gets some clarity on something.

278
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:45,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I understanding right that the mayor basically got this to the city council just today, this afternoon?

279
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:51,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Micah, I'll answer questions at the end of your comment.

280
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:52,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sure.

281
01:02:52,355 --> 01:03:02,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, so if that is my understanding, I just, I think it is really bears pointing out that this is like a pattern of behavior that is

282
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:12,566
[SPEAKER_09]: making all processes that go before the council and require collaboration with the mayor far more difficult and challenging than they need to be.

283
01:03:12,586 --> 01:03:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the mayor's full time job.

284
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:19,712
[SPEAKER_09]: This is none of no single counselor has this as their full time job.

285
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:27,698
[SPEAKER_09]: This like last minute it you know, sometimes dog ate my homework type type of

286
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:35,797
[SPEAKER_09]: handing in of deliverables that need to be vetted and reviewed by the council really needs to improve.

287
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,399
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very challenging.

288
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:44,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Also challenging for the public too, because we also want to see what's going on and look at what's submitted.

289
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, I'm happy to see that this is finally coming to a close.

290
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:50,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks to you guys.

291
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:55,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And also thanks to the mayor for working with you guys on it.

292
01:03:58,796 --> 01:04:02,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, yeah, we received this by email at 4.30, 4 p.m.

293
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:02,598
[SPEAKER_12]: today.

294
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:14,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any, and actually at 5.30, well, actually I'm not sure we all received it, I'm not sure.

295
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:17,625
[SPEAKER_12]: I received it at 4.30, 4 p.m.

296
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:17,885
[SPEAKER_12]: today.

297
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:21,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lemming?

298
01:04:24,468 --> 01:04:26,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just to clarify sort of the,

299
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:54,812
[SPEAKER_13]: back and forth, I believe an initial draft was sent out, I think it was Monday or Monday or Tuesday, or no, sorry, no, sorry, an initial draft was sent out at some time last week, and then there was, I did have a back and forth with the mayor on just like wording that would be more acceptable, and there were just,

300
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:07,859
[SPEAKER_13]: There are just some points of sort of contention that I know that my colleagues expressed at the previous meeting as well.

301
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:16,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yes, the final draft of this did come out quite late before this meeting, but there

302
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:33,332
[SPEAKER_13]: But from what I was seeing on the back end, there wasn't any particularly egregious delays from the mayor's end of things, at least within the past week.

303
01:05:36,703 --> 01:05:45,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it could have been improved if, you know, they, we started to work on a press release immediately after the last meeting, but that didn't happen.

304
01:05:45,086 --> 01:05:53,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and obviously to address some of Micah's points, I don't, I didn't like this process.

305
01:05:53,689 --> 01:05:56,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anybody did like this process.

306
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:01,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot's been said about it at previous meetings, but I'm,

307
01:06:02,987 --> 01:06:06,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to move forward on it.

308
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:17,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this is probably the best deal between both parties that we will end up getting.

309
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councillor Lemming.

310
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:25,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this topic in the public hearing?

311
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:35,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing no one in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

312
01:06:36,712 --> 01:06:37,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion?

313
01:06:37,713 --> 01:06:39,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Councilor Lemming, you had two motions.

314
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:44,139
[SPEAKER_12]: If you wanna, I can see if I can get them down myself.

315
01:06:44,179 --> 01:06:48,543
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a motion for a B paper to approve the, here, you go ahead.

316
01:06:49,773 --> 01:07:09,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, so I'm not sure about the order of it, but I would say the B paper would be approving the wording of the press release, and then the A paper would be the Salem Street amendment itself.

317
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:17,750
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, obviously, if the Salem Street vote fails, then the mayor doesn't actually have to release this.

318
01:07:20,007 --> 01:07:21,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it, do we have any questions?

319
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:44,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a motion on a B paper to approve the language of the draft press released, submitted by the mayor on Tuesday, December 2nd, by Councilor Lemming.

320
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second on that motion?

321
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:49,651
[SPEAKER_12]: seconded by Councilor Seng, and then we'll take a motion on the main paper.

322
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:53,193
[SPEAKER_12]: On the B paper, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

323
01:07:58,097 --> 01:07:58,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan?

324
01:07:58,958 --> 01:07:59,018
Yes.

325
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:01,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins?

326
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:01,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

327
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:03,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lazaro?

328
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:03,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

329
01:08:05,063 --> 01:08:05,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lemming?

330
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:05,803
Yes.

331
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

332
01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:08,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

333
01:08:09,206 --> 01:08:09,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Seng?

334
01:08:09,927 --> 01:08:09,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

335
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:11,328
[SPEAKER_14]: President Beers?

336
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:11,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

337
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, seven the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

338
01:08:15,152 --> 01:08:25,018
[SPEAKER_12]: And then on the main paper, this is the motion to adopt the zoning amendment submitted to us by the Community Development Board, paper 25160.

339
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:26,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me just double check.

340
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:45,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And once again, this is from Danielle Evans, Senior Planner, Office of Planning Development Sustainability on behalf of the Community Development Board.

341
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:55,845
[SPEAKER_12]: The Community Development Board held a public meeting on September 17th, 2025 to consider a request from the Mayor to initiate a zoning amendment to the Salem Street Corridor District in accordance with the provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 5.

342
01:08:56,746 --> 01:09:02,107
[SPEAKER_12]: The proposed amendment as described in the attached memorandum from Mayor Longo Kern to the Community Development Board dated September 15th,

343
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:12,072
[SPEAKER_12]: would amend the zoning map to change the designation from MX2 to MX1 for the parcels within the Salem Street and Park Street node as shown on the map entitled Salem Street Corridor Zoning dated March 3rd, 2025.

344
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:20,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Board members present at the meeting were Acting Chair Adam Behrens, Member John Anderson, Member Sean Began, Member Doug Carr, and Member Dina Collegero.

345
01:09:21,356 --> 01:09:24,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian appeared before the board and presented the request.

346
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:31,900
[SPEAKER_12]: After consideration of the request, the Community Development Board voted unanimously 5-0 to submit the zoning amendment to the City Council as presented.

347
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:39,740
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the motion to adopt the zoning amendment as presented by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang.

348
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

349
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:44,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

369
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:21,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me one second here again.

370
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:21,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, y'all.

371
01:10:22,026 --> 01:10:28,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just gonna take it online.

372
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:44,206
[SPEAKER_12]: One second, sorry.

373
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:51,611
[SPEAKER_12]: November 25th, 2025, regarding Affordable Housing Trust Action Plan and Guidelines 2025 to 2030.

[SPEAKER_03]: For the for, it's been a, it was a busy year.

[SPEAKER_03]: It was a, a whirlwind.

396
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:31,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We had our first meeting in August 2025.

397

[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you might want to throw the Gmail on.

404
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,680
[SPEAKER_12]: That might get through the spam filter faster.

[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

415
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,872
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know who to send it to.

416
01:14:46,352 --> 01:14:46,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

417
01:14:52,636 --> 01:14:56,560

01:14:56,741 --> 01:14:57,321
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it, Matt?

419
01:14:58,142 --> 01:15:00,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I still am looking through.

[SPEAKER_13]: I got something.

[SPEAKER_13]: I got something.

423
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

424
01:15:05,151 --> 01:15:06,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I found it in my Gmail.

425
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,699
[SPEAKER_12]: which is not where I was looking, but I forwarded it.

426
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:11,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, now I'm pulling it up.

427
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,641
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks very pretty.

428
01:15:12,661 --> 01:15:17,144
[SPEAKER_12]: I forwarded it to Matt, too, so eventually there will be slides on the screen for you to look at at some point.

429
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:20,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Roberto works so hard on the slides, and they make them so telecoordinated.

430
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:20,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

431
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

432
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Matt.

433
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:21,748
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

434
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:22,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

435
01:15:22,168 --> 01:15:22,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

436
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

437
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:40,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can just skip right to slide three is our timeline.

438
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:41,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

439
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:42,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

440
01:15:42,073 --> 01:15:51,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course the timeline is very small but because we were so busy this year we wanted to cram it all in on our on our slide show on what we've done.

441
01:15:59,308 --> 01:16:02,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a refresher of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

442
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in March of 2023, the ordinance was adopted that established the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

443
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: In July of 2024, the members were appointed to the trust.

444
01:16:16,396 --> 01:16:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the fall of 2024 through the summer of 2025, there was a subcommittee that was formed to work on the draft plan.

445
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: January 2025, we created the Declaration of Trust, which is now recorded at the Registry of Deeds.

446
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:51,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We received funding in the amount of $300,000 from the CPC to help create affordable housing, fill the financial gap of affordable housing.

447
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:55,787
[SPEAKER_03]: for the nonprofit partners that are building housing.

448
01:16:55,807 --> 01:17:01,952
[SPEAKER_03]: In May of 2025, we issued our first NOFO, Notice of Funds Available.

449
01:17:02,813 --> 01:17:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: In August of 2025, we voted to approve our first loan.

450
01:17:07,476 --> 01:17:11,360
[SPEAKER_03]: The Affordable Housing Trust Fund chose to make loans instead of grants.

451
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:21,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The funds that we award, it rolls back at us, and we can have a continued source of revenue to fund affordable housing.

452
01:17:22,362 --> 01:17:35,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, fall of 2025, we applied for CPA, additional CPA funding, and we are now implementing the action, the, our action plan that we created.

453
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:42,707
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will take over introducing the action plan itself.

454
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:50,932
[SPEAKER_16]: The action plan, by the way, is available on the Housing Trust's webpage if anybody wants to refer to it.

455
01:17:52,993 --> 01:18:01,138
[SPEAKER_16]: The action plan, we prepared it, as Lisa mentioned, over for, between the fall of 2024 and summer 2025.

456
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:19,403
[SPEAKER_16]: We went through first compiling data, looking at existing data to understand kind of what Medford's housing market looks like, who lives in Medford, and what our housing looks like and where the housing needs are in the community.

457
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:25,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we undertook some very extensive stakeholder outreach.

458
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:35,623
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a series of meetings with organizations, other government entities, non-profits, developers in the area.

459
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:40,146
[SPEAKER_16]: to understand what does it take to build housing in Medford?

460
01:18:40,226 --> 01:18:46,250
[SPEAKER_16]: What do they see as Medford's housing needs and potential ways to address the housing needs?

461
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:53,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And what are some lessons learned that we could implement to be able to get up to speed very quickly?

462
01:18:53,815 --> 01:18:59,979
[SPEAKER_16]: And then after gathering input from the stakeholders, we went and gathered public input.

463
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,423
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a public outreach meeting, a public workshop,

464
01:19:06,264 --> 01:19:17,576
[SPEAKER_16]: where we presented the data and some of our findings and then asked for public input about housing needs and potential opportunities to address those housing needs.

465
01:19:18,237 --> 01:19:22,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Then the housing trust board all together

466
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:37,158
[SPEAKER_16]: spent a few of our monthly meetings developing our goals and potential actions to undertake over the first five years for the housing trust.

467
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:53,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we presented this again to the public in July this past year and spent the subsequent months pulling together the final plan that you have in front of you.

468
01:19:55,105 --> 01:20:03,173
[SPEAKER_16]: So the plan has, just to walk you through it, there is an executive summary starting on page five.

469
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:07,116
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there are three sections to the plan.

470
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:10,820
[SPEAKER_16]: The first section is analysis and context.

471
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:14,032
[SPEAKER_16]: the data analysis that we provided.

472
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:23,816
[SPEAKER_16]: The second section of the plan talks about the community engagement and stakeholder engagement efforts and what we learned from that.

473
01:20:23,996 --> 01:20:29,478
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the third section of the plan is the action plan itself.

474
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:35,620
[SPEAKER_16]: which Lisa will talk more about in a moment, but I will go through the analysis and context with you.

475
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:40,381
[SPEAKER_16]: The first question that we asked is, who lives in Medford?

476
01:20:40,781 --> 01:20:44,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And some really interesting things that we learned from the data.

477
01:20:44,822 --> 01:20:49,863
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, Medford gained over 4,000 young adults between 2010 and 2020.

478
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:50,763
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just really out and

479
01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:58,146
[SPEAKER_16]: a figure that really stands out for us.

480
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:06,670
[SPEAKER_16]: All other age groups stayed about the same or lost population during this time, so we shifted toward a younger population.

481
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,572
[SPEAKER_16]: We're experiencing a significant increase in non-family households.

482
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:17,278
[SPEAKER_16]: especially in unrelated people living together or roommates.

483
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:24,827
[SPEAKER_16]: We're seeing a diminishing share of families, seniors, and people living alone.

484
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:29,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford is gaining in diversity in terms of its

485
01:21:31,318 --> 01:21:32,838
[SPEAKER_16]: It's racial, ethnic mix.

486
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:39,740
[SPEAKER_16]: But interestingly, we have a smaller share of people with disabilities than the state average.

487
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:48,423
[SPEAKER_16]: And this might be because of the quality of housing that we have that doesn't accommodate people with disabilities, so they may be having to live elsewhere.

488
01:21:49,483 --> 01:21:55,305
[SPEAKER_16]: So I accidentally skipped a slide, so we can just pause here for a moment.

489
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:59,826
[SPEAKER_16]: The next bit of data that we looked at is, what does Medford's housing look like?

490
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:18,155
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we learned that about 39% of our housing are single-family homes, 35% are small multi-families, that is, two to three family buildings, and 47% of our homes are renter-occupied, so just under half is renter-occupied.

491
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:23,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of our two to three family homes are around 100 years old.

492
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:33,305
[SPEAKER_16]: that the rate of all housing construction dropped sharply around 19 or before 1940.

493
01:22:33,986 --> 01:22:48,358
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the last lifetime, most of the development has been single-family homes with some very large apartment buildings and condo buildings mixed in.

494
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Average assessed values of single family homes and condos have been increasing.

495
01:22:55,625 --> 01:23:10,077
[SPEAKER_16]: They've, since between 2017 and 20, I forget which, what is the most recent year that's cited of assessor's data that's cited in the, for, in the, the market study.

496
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:12,659
[SPEAKER_16]: We've seen a 50 to 60% increase.

497
01:23:14,941 --> 01:23:16,363
[SPEAKER_16]: over the past five years.

498
01:23:17,544 --> 01:23:27,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Newer units are increasingly large and more expensive with average assessed values over a million dollars for single family homes built after 2000.

499
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:38,059
[SPEAKER_16]: We also saw from the assessor's data that housing has a lower value per unit as the number of units in a building increases.

500
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:51,133
[SPEAKER_16]: So that means that multifamily housing is inherently more affordable by per unit than single family or smaller multifamily housing.

501
01:23:53,372 --> 01:23:58,475
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also learned, interestingly, that Medford lacks smaller sized units.

502
01:23:58,955 --> 01:24:06,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Only 15% of our housing units have one bedroom, while almost 30% of our households have only one person.

503
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:15,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Plus, we learned about all of those roommate households earlier who might prefer to live in smaller housing units if they were available.

504
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:17,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

505
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:22,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So who is struggling with housing costs in Medford?

506
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:33,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Around 5,500 households, that's about 25% of our households, are below 50% of area median income.

507
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:35,744
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a really large share.

508
01:24:36,325 --> 01:24:44,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Two thirds of these households are housing cost burdened with a significant share spending more than half of their income on housing.

509
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:49,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford has a significant share of low-income homeowners.

510
01:24:50,235 --> 01:25:01,662
[SPEAKER_16]: In particular, seniors over the age of 65 comprise one-third of all homeowners, and the median income for seniors' households is only $44,000.

511
01:25:01,982 --> 01:25:07,345
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a really stark number that also stands out.

512
01:25:08,385 --> 01:25:13,550
[SPEAKER_16]: The median household income for all households is $115,000.

513
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:23,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Young adults, renters, and non-family households have lower median incomes, but the disparity is less than the county or state level data.

514
01:25:25,615 --> 01:25:48,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Median household income for renters, meanwhile, has increased rapidly, which reflects what it requires to move into Medford today, and it also reflects displacement because renters are being pushed out to market apartments to higher income households or to more roommate households.

515
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Note that

516
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:58,535
[SPEAKER_16]: a household by the definition that we measure income by is just anybody who lives in a housing unit.

517
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_16]: So those multiple roommates who live in a housing unit, each with their own income, contribute to higher household incomes.

518
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:14,722
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not actually a growth in wages, it's a growth in the number of wage earners per housing unit that we have.

519
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:21,589
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's all of our local housing data.

520
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide.

521
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:31,556
[SPEAKER_16]: We also looked at what are the existing resources that we have in the community.

522
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:39,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, we have a total of just over 2,000 affordable housing units, which comprises 8.12% of our

523
01:26:44,885 --> 01:26:49,728
[SPEAKER_16]: of our housing units citywide, which is the SHI number.

524
01:26:49,768 --> 01:26:59,012
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a subsidized housing inventory number that we are looking to meet the minimum 10% threshold for.

525
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:06,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of our housing, affordable housing units are with the Medford Housing Authority.

526
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:23,288
[SPEAKER_16]: 851 of the units are public housing units, and then we also have 700 project-based Section 8 housing units, which are also subsidized through the Medford Housing Authority.

527
01:27:23,888 --> 01:27:32,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We have also 49 units which are administered by the state to serve people with disabilities.

528
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:46,216
[SPEAKER_16]: And the remainder are privately owned affordable housing units, 289 of which are in 40B developments, which are not even constructed yet.

529
01:27:46,316 --> 01:27:53,099
[SPEAKER_16]: So those units don't actually exist, but we already get to count them toward our subsidized housing inventory.

530
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the picture.

531
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,441
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have about 2.3, we have about

532
01:28:03,384 --> 01:28:07,549
[SPEAKER_16]: $2 million annually in the entire CPA program.

533
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:13,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Over six years, we've spent about $4 million on affordable housing.

534
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:22,565
[SPEAKER_16]: That's roughly 25% of the CPA money so far has been spent on affordable housing.

535
01:28:24,006 --> 01:28:31,910
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also part of the North Suburban Home Consortium, which shares about 2.3 million among eight communities.

536
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:41,694
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's just the monetary resources that are available to non-profits today who are looking to build in Medford.

537
01:28:42,795 --> 01:28:52,140
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a lot of money, and so the Affordable Housing Trust is here to try to grow that resource that's available to support affordable housing development.

538
01:28:52,940 --> 01:29:04,829
[SPEAKER_16]: One other thing I want to bring to your attention, I don't have a slide, but in the plan on page seven is a table that shows recent housing strategies and initiatives.

539
01:29:05,389 --> 01:29:15,977
[SPEAKER_16]: This table summarizes the strategies and initiatives that are described in Medford's housing production plan and the comprehensive plan.

540
01:29:16,637 --> 01:29:22,240
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of these strategies as identified in the table have, some have been completed.

541
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:24,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of them are in progress right now.

542
01:29:24,702 --> 01:29:26,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Some have not really gotten underway.

543
01:29:27,544 --> 01:29:32,286
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of these are relevant to the Affordable Housing Trust.

544
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:36,409
[SPEAKER_16]: They may be things that the Affordable Housing Trust can help to address.

545
01:29:36,909 --> 01:29:41,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these are not in the, the prerogative of the Affordable Housing Trust.

546
01:29:41,832 --> 01:29:45,314
[SPEAKER_16]: But we wanted to understand the context that we're working under.

547
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:51,946
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that, next slide, please.

548
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:53,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Just want to make sure.

549
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:56,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I did summarize what I just mentioned on this slide.

550
01:29:57,829 --> 01:30:07,294
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that, I'd like to pass back over to Lisa to talk about the action plan for the Affordable Housing Trust.

551
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:08,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Roberta.

552
01:30:09,175 --> 01:30:12,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So the action plan, what are we going to do with all the data that we just did, right?

553
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:15,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing we did was we created our mission.

554
01:30:15,338 --> 01:30:31,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a mission statement and our mission statement is to create and preserve community housing including affordable home ownership and rental opportunities and other forms of housing assistance to low and moderate income households, residents in Somerville, in Medford, excuse me, sorry.

555
01:30:33,726 --> 01:30:34,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.

556
01:30:35,608 --> 01:30:37,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our goals.

557
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're here.

558
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to create affordable housing.

559
01:30:41,072 --> 01:30:55,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to promote and welcome diverse, intergenerational, inclusive city with the mix of housing choices that offer diverse options to residents with varying needs and preferences.

560
01:30:55,926 --> 01:31:05,637
[SPEAKER_03]: use our financial and property resources to help address the local housing needs and meet the production goals established in the housing production plan.

561
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:14,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to foster safe, well-designed, accessible, sustainable housing, integrated, affordable, and diverse housing options throughout the city.

562
01:31:15,508 --> 01:31:26,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to expand local capacity to implement housing initiatives by building partnerships with mission-driven organizations and developers seeking to build affordable housing.

563
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Increase communication about housing resources across the community.

564
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to build affordable housing partnerships with the mission-driven organizations and developers seeking to build affordable housing as well as the Medford Housing Authority.

565
01:31:48,612 --> 01:31:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to preserve and convert existing housing to long-term affordability, support existing homeowners and first-time home buyers.

566
01:31:57,915 --> 01:31:58,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide.

567
01:31:59,816 --> 01:32:08,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Fund housing, housing stability programs and prioritizing funding for units affordable to households with lower, lower incomes.

568
01:32:08,748 --> 01:32:13,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next slide.

569
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:17,114
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot that we want to do, right?

570
01:32:18,215 --> 01:32:33,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to build relationships with the Community Preservation Committee, advocate for affordable housing developments and policies that maximize the resources available to meet the city's housing needs, explore and act upon funding opportunities for the trust,

571
01:32:33,905 --> 01:32:37,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Work with developers to build support and navigate approval process.

572
01:32:38,527 --> 01:32:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Work with partner organizations to establish programs that meet local needs.

573
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:49,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Support initiatives to expand tenant protections and stabilize existing tenancies.

574
01:32:49,913 --> 01:32:56,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Provide guidance on the affordable housing projects funded through the CPA programs.

575
01:32:56,436 --> 01:32:56,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

576
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:22,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the trust's commitments to working with the non-profit partners, Medford Housing Authority, Community Development Corporations, Community Land Trust, the Community Housing Development Organizations, otherwise known as our CHODOs, and comprehensive permit projects.

577
01:33:24,522 --> 01:33:25,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is our plan.

578
01:33:25,803 --> 01:33:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have any questions?

579
01:33:28,724 --> 01:33:32,066
[SPEAKER_12]: We have questions from members of the council and thank you Councilman Eken and the screen share.

580
01:33:35,569 --> 01:33:36,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilman Lemmick.

581
01:33:36,329 --> 01:33:36,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

582
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

583
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:43,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad to see this, glad to see this taking off.

584
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:50,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Glad, happy to, looking forward to voting to endorse the plan.

585
01:33:51,698 --> 01:33:59,822
[SPEAKER_13]: What initiatives do you expect will take up, will you be doing day to day over about the next year?

586
01:33:59,922 --> 01:34:06,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So what issues do you think will fill up your agendas in the next 12 months or so?

587
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:09,764
[SPEAKER_03]: right now is trying to build that bank account.

588
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:13,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes money to create affordable housing.

589
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a balance of $300,000 at the moment.

590
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:18,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

591
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:18,550
$300,000?

592
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,351
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent some of it.

593
01:34:20,451 --> 01:34:20,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

594
01:34:20,751 --> 01:34:21,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're down to $200,000.

595
01:34:23,373 --> 01:34:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to fill in a gap over at the 708 Bellsways West.

596
01:34:30,558 --> 01:34:31,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So yay.

597
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:33,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be it.

598
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thing is looking at building a bank account,

599
01:34:37,437 --> 01:34:42,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, we're really gonna be focusing on development applications.

600
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:50,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So applications from our partners, our non-profit partners that are looking to build in Medford that are having financial gaps.

601
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:55,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can we assist with those funding sources?

602
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:56,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

603
01:35:00,332 --> 01:35:00,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

604
01:35:00,732 --> 01:35:01,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor Scarpelli.

605
01:35:03,388 --> 01:35:03,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

606
01:35:04,529 --> 01:35:10,575
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something I know that former Councilor Falco really envisioned in 2021, and this is where it started.

607
01:35:10,655 --> 01:35:18,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would like to give him credit for seeing and envisioning this and getting to this point, and I appreciate all the hard work.

608
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:23,428
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, I want to bring to light what's scaring people.

609
01:35:24,048 --> 01:35:25,669
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something we shall be celebrating.

610
01:35:25,729 --> 01:35:29,150
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that shouldn't divide, it should unify, right?

611
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:37,632
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're saying is that the phone calls I received, the input that I received, things that are scaring people, right?

612
01:35:39,513 --> 01:35:42,634
[SPEAKER_15]: One is that this has done an extensive survey.

613
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:45,915
[SPEAKER_15]: There were 71 people in a community of 60,000.

614
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:54,622
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's when you, when you, and you see some of these people that come, comments made from people that live in different communities.

615
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:59,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the things that kind of, wait a second, what, I didn't care about the survey.

616
01:35:59,684 --> 01:36:00,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't see the survey.

617
01:36:00,584 --> 01:36:10,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, this is something we're seeing that's being, it's a constant that we're seeing that are really, that are going to hinder projects and make this something that we can all rally around and support.

618
01:36:10,568 --> 01:36:12,669
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that that's one thing that I'm a little,

619
01:36:13,123 --> 01:36:16,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to bring forth so you can understand what I'm hearing.

620
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:18,434
[SPEAKER_15]: It's no different than we're hearing.

621
01:36:20,484 --> 01:36:22,385
[SPEAKER_15]: the debt exclusion for the new school, right?

622
01:36:22,745 --> 01:36:23,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's nervous.

623
01:36:23,565 --> 01:36:24,605
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be attacks.

624
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:27,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody hears because we're not sending out the proper messaging.

625
01:36:28,286 --> 01:36:30,107
[SPEAKER_15]: And so people can understand what it's done.

626
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:40,570
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, some of the things that people have pointed out in some of the survey questions that they think that people, when they read it, it's coming from the people that organize it.

627
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:42,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, no, you have to understand the context.

628
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:47,151
[SPEAKER_15]: And you see things like requiring annual tax for rental property owners.

629
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:48,572
[SPEAKER_15]: That's frightening.

630
01:36:49,487 --> 01:36:57,914
[SPEAKER_15]: So people get scared when they read these things that are posted, when you see the real estate transfer fee, when you see tax overrides.

631
01:36:58,435 --> 01:37:05,361
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the things that people say, we want affordable housing, we want to support our trust, affordable housing trust.

632
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:09,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's so many avenues that we can use, but I think that making sure the messaging

633
01:37:11,077 --> 01:37:28,228
[SPEAKER_15]: is done correctly so everybody can understand it, where it's not something that, here we go again, it's the senior citizen that owns a home that lives on a fixed income that we're now looking to have a tenant that helps subsidize their income and pay for their taxes.

634
01:37:28,269 --> 01:37:31,210
[SPEAKER_15]: But now all of a sudden, someone's telling them, hey,

635
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:57,093
[SPEAKER_15]: this is a process that people are looking at to put another tax in if you own a rental property, or this is a transfer tax that if you sell a house, or, you know, even something to the, working with developers, you know, there's an outrageous story going around that, and this is where we want to get ahead of things is that there are developers that are petitioning the CPA saying, you know,

636
01:37:58,767 --> 01:38:00,969
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to build ADUs.

637
01:38:01,649 --> 01:38:07,653
[SPEAKER_15]: And to build the 400,000 ADU, we need our taxpayers' money to give us half of that.

638
01:38:08,714 --> 01:38:15,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So a wealthy developer is asking for our taxpayers' money to build an ADU, an affordable housing ADU.

639
01:38:16,978 --> 01:38:20,859
[SPEAKER_15]: is that these are the things that people are coming to me and saying, is this happening?

640
01:38:20,879 --> 01:38:35,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this really where we're going with the process where there are so many other amazing options that we can focus on to create revenue to support this initiative?

641
01:38:35,802 --> 01:38:38,663
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's where I think that I

642
01:38:39,443 --> 01:38:50,296
[SPEAKER_15]: that I bring to light just to share with you the fact that as we get this started, that, you know, again, when we have surveys that we did in July, we had a meeting in July.

643
01:38:51,178 --> 01:38:52,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is that not appealing to people?

644
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,460
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we hearing from the community?

645
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,042
[SPEAKER_15]: We're having meetings where no one's around.

646
01:38:57,462 --> 01:38:58,723
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that we're trying to hide.

647
01:38:58,763 --> 01:39:02,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to say we're hiding it, but these are the questions we're hearing when you're talking about rezoning.

648
01:39:02,986 --> 01:39:06,348
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about what we just dealt with earlier.

649
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:19,199
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the things that we have to find a better way to work with our administration to make sure our communications team is really getting the word out to everybody.

650
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:22,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, these are surveys that should go out in tax bills.

651
01:39:22,662 --> 01:39:24,844
[SPEAKER_15]: These are surveys that should be going out to everybody.

652
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:33,932
[SPEAKER_15]: So a homeowner can see this and, you know what, maybe there are homeowners that are looking at this saying, you know what, I live in a three family, I own the home, I have two.

653
01:39:34,152 --> 01:39:36,113
[SPEAKER_15]: This might be something that I want to,

654
01:39:37,094 --> 01:39:44,917
[SPEAKER_15]: voluntarily give, donate a percentage to support the Affordable Housing Trust.

655
01:39:45,437 --> 01:40:01,144
[SPEAKER_15]: See, these are the things, again, that I need to stress before I can support something like this, because I think, again, pushing something through, getting something out after all the hard work that you've done, and really not getting the, saying that we've gone through the full

656
01:40:02,016 --> 01:40:06,381
[SPEAKER_15]: communication process that's needed when you're talking about so many people.

657
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:12,769
[SPEAKER_15]: because I don't want to be here in a year and say, wait a second, we knew nothing about this.

658
01:40:12,829 --> 01:40:20,552
[SPEAKER_15]: This wasn't presented correctly, just like a, you know, a trash fee, you know, changing trash pickup once every two weeks.

659
01:40:20,592 --> 01:40:25,895
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the things that I, that's what we, I bring that up just to be cautious and understand to go forward.

660
01:40:26,655 --> 01:40:27,595
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to be negative.

661
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:32,818
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want you to see the other side that I've been hearing what is scaring people that,

662
01:40:34,233 --> 01:40:45,217
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've told many people that this is something that there's so many other things, when you look at this, that are positive, that we can look and say, how do we do support the younger families?

663
01:40:45,257 --> 01:40:48,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I have a 22-year-old son that wants to stay in metric.

664
01:40:49,479 --> 01:40:51,180
[SPEAKER_15]: And we know it's going to be difficult for him.

665
01:40:51,969 --> 01:40:56,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless, you know, dad builds something off the side of the house, and that's possible.

666
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:57,070
[SPEAKER_15]: And that might be.

667
01:40:57,370 --> 01:41:05,412
[SPEAKER_15]: That's another avenue that we read that looking at, you know, how do we reclassify our zoning to help with the affordable housing building.

668
01:41:05,572 --> 01:41:06,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I move in?

669
01:41:06,372 --> 01:41:06,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir.

670
01:41:06,952 --> 01:41:07,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I move in on time?

671
01:41:07,852 --> 01:41:08,212
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

672
01:41:09,212 --> 01:41:12,673
[SPEAKER_15]: The rent would be terribly high.

673
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:17,474
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd be watching a lot of football, though.

674
01:41:17,794 --> 01:41:18,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I don't.

675
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:23,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I'm trying to be a different, I don't want to send a negative message.

676
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:25,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to be a negative rabble rouser.

677
01:41:26,449 --> 01:41:28,611
[SPEAKER_15]: This position gets very tiring when that happens.

678
01:41:29,052 --> 01:41:43,264
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it's important that everybody understands the messaging that I'm getting that what's frustrating our community when you see these initiatives that people read and it's in print and they say, wait a second, that's scary.

679
01:41:46,459 --> 01:41:47,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we tag team it?

680
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:51,881
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I appreciate the feedback.

681
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:52,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

682
01:41:52,701 --> 01:42:05,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we were talking about this, creating the action plan, it was very important to the committee that was doing the action plan to make sure that we did the best that we could to get the word out.

683
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:10,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertising of the, I'm sure Roberta will

684
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:16,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill in where I'm missing, but we did the surveys.

685
01:42:16,765 --> 01:42:29,202
[SPEAKER_03]: We did as much as we can, and I would welcome the feedback on how to better make sure, or how to more effectively, I don't want to say better, more effectively make sure that

686
01:42:30,147 --> 01:42:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: when we are getting our, doing our workshops and trying to put the word out and tell people what we're doing, because I'm excited about what we're doing.

687
01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:51,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's phenomenal that Medford has an affordable housing trust fund and Medford is really going to look and find creative ways and try to develop.

688
01:42:51,559 --> 01:42:53,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm extremely excited about it.

689
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing housing forever in my

690
01:42:57,282 --> 01:43:00,484
[SPEAKER_03]: my real world job, full time job.

691
01:43:01,825 --> 01:43:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the opportunity.

692
01:43:02,946 --> 01:43:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved into Medford 20 some odd years ago and finally hearing about creating affordable housing in Medford is exciting.

693
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:13,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a daughter who had to leave Medford.

694
01:43:13,032 --> 01:43:14,453
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't want to live with me.

695
01:43:16,362 --> 01:43:18,243
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, so I'm excited.

696
01:43:18,263 --> 01:43:24,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I would welcome the feedback on any way that we can better promote what we're doing.

697
01:43:25,048 --> 01:43:35,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first, when we did our first community meeting with the community, we spent a lot of time of actually defining what affordable housing is with the people that came in the room.

698
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And we broke down the different types of housing out there.

699
01:43:40,038 --> 01:43:48,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a huge advocate of getting the word out and making sure people understand what we're trying to do because we're not trying to do anything radical.

700
01:43:49,743 --> 01:43:58,567
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to create housing here in Medford for everybody to be able to stay and in a welcoming community.

701
01:43:58,647 --> 01:43:59,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Medford.

702
01:43:59,428 --> 01:44:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really exciting.

703
01:44:01,028 --> 01:44:02,849
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't mind, I just have a follow-up to that.

704
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:03,890
[SPEAKER_12]: It's okay.

705
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,752
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering because I think this is kind of the trap we fall into sometimes in the city.

706
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:14,920
[SPEAKER_12]: How much of this outreach was tasked, was it the volunteers of the Affordable Housing Trust who were doing that outreach?

707
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:18,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Versus how much support was available from the city staff?

708
01:44:19,943 --> 01:44:25,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had an amazing city staffer that helped us with, with, with putting out the word.

709
01:44:25,185 --> 01:44:25,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

710
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:28,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on the community access plant channel.

711
01:44:28,607 --> 01:44:31,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we had, it was on the community access channel.

712
01:44:31,929 --> 01:44:36,971
[SPEAKER_16]: We had flyers that, that were posted around the community in different languages.

713
01:44:37,031 --> 01:44:43,154
[SPEAKER_16]: They were translated shared through the city's communication channels and

714
01:44:44,535 --> 01:44:50,339
[SPEAKER_16]: and on social media, and directly through organizations in the community.

715
01:44:51,440 --> 01:45:10,454
[SPEAKER_16]: One observation, technical observation I would make is that a written survey was one part of the public engagement strategy for this planning effort, which also entailed two public meetings and the stakeholder workshops as well.

716
01:45:11,154 --> 01:45:14,135
[SPEAKER_16]: So we made an effort to hear from people.

717
01:45:14,696 --> 01:45:18,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Only so many people responded to that effort.

718
01:45:19,178 --> 01:45:23,600
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would also respond to the comment about people from outside of Medford.

719
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:24,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I looked at the data.

720
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:30,683
[SPEAKER_16]: There were two respondents out of 70 who didn't live in Medford.

721
01:45:30,803 --> 01:45:34,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Those two respondents might be people who work in Medford.

722
01:45:34,865 --> 01:45:40,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Or they might be people who lived in Medford until recently and have been displaced from Medford.

723
01:45:41,309 --> 01:45:58,621
[SPEAKER_16]: So I assume that their concern about Medford's housing needs is driven by their having a relationship with Medford that they have an experience in Medford that

724
01:46:01,923 --> 01:46:05,065
[SPEAKER_16]: informs their understanding of Medford's housing needs.

725
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:25,160
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing that I wanted to point out about the housing trust action plan is that while the housing trust would advocate for additional revenue sources, for the most part, any additional revenue sources that the trust might receive would have to come through the city council.

726
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:34,745
[SPEAKER_16]: So the City Council is ultimately going to be the arbiter of whether we fill the coffers of the Affordable Housing Trust.

727
01:46:34,986 --> 01:46:37,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I can, Mr. President, and I appreciate that.

728
01:46:38,067 --> 01:46:41,730
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the last piece is monumental.

729
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,291
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to come back on us.

730
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:52,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we haven't educated everybody, you talk about the stakeholders, realistically, 70 people in a community of 60,000, the stakeholders,

731
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,763
[SPEAKER_15]: The ones that are going to be most impacted are who?

732
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,306
[SPEAKER_15]: The homeowners.

733
01:46:59,368 --> 01:47:00,611
[SPEAKER_15]: The people that are paying the taxes.

734
01:47:00,711 --> 01:47:05,942
[SPEAKER_15]: The people that can really look at this process and either support it or stand against it.

735
01:47:06,932 --> 01:47:14,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather educate those people and guide them so they are allies instead of contentious and negative and dividing.

736
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:15,736
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I'm trying to say.

737
01:47:16,136 --> 01:47:26,140
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you talk about the 70 and even two being outside of Medford, the messaging is that there was only 70 and there were two people outside of Medford.

738
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:32,383
[SPEAKER_15]: So I understand your input, but the messaging that goes out isn't framed that way.

739
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

740
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:34,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameron, it really isn't.

741
01:47:35,111 --> 01:47:37,392
[SPEAKER_15]: It's made to be confrontational.

742
01:47:37,792 --> 01:47:42,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's all I want to share with you, because I think that Zach's question was one of the questions I was going to ask.

743
01:47:42,714 --> 01:47:44,354
[SPEAKER_15]: How much work did the city do?

744
01:47:44,795 --> 01:47:49,436
[SPEAKER_15]: How much work did our administration do to support you to make sure that messaging was sent out correctly?

745
01:47:49,957 --> 01:47:55,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, many different languages, flyers, it's going to certain groups, right?

746
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:59,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Certain groups that are invested in this because they want to live in Medford, and they can't afford it.

747
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,761
[SPEAKER_15]: So I understand that.

748
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:03,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course they're gonna support that.

749
01:48:03,879 --> 01:48:09,661
[SPEAKER_15]: But when it comes down to the process, it has to be make sure that all the stakeholders are informed.

750
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:24,565
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you said to me, George, yes, the city staff did do it and the assessor's office sent a survey out to homeowners that are going to be impacted on this because what this is asking for is what?

751
01:48:25,006 --> 01:48:26,346
[SPEAKER_15]: It's from funding, right?

752
01:48:27,066 --> 01:48:28,487
[SPEAKER_15]: The funding that's coming from where?

753
01:48:28,767 --> 01:48:29,467
[SPEAKER_15]: The taxpayers.

754
01:48:30,696 --> 01:48:49,437
[SPEAKER_15]: that the taxpayers that were just given an override, the taxpayers that are now looking at a debt exclusion, the taxpayers that have many multiple issues that have already come up that we're hearing, rent control, transfer tax, these are the things that I'm bringing forward just so you can understand that are important that if we're ahead of it,

755
01:48:50,497 --> 01:48:52,679
[SPEAKER_15]: that we've been trying to battle as a team.

756
01:48:52,699 --> 01:49:09,817
[SPEAKER_15]: I think all of us saying, can we communicate better with the people that have the ability to do that and making sure the messaging is sent out correctly that we can sit there and say, hey, listen, we're not looking at hurting our taxpayers, our homeowners that have rental properties.

757
01:49:10,418 --> 01:49:25,912
[SPEAKER_15]: We have avenues instead, let's rally around looking at developers and looking at ways to look at linkage to say, hey, this percentage goes to our affordable housing or different avenues like that, that we can all hang our hats on, that we can all advocate for.

758
01:49:25,932 --> 01:49:27,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I wanted to share.

759
01:49:28,214 --> 01:49:32,098
[SPEAKER_15]: It's easy to be the one that shares the negative side of it.

760
01:49:32,218 --> 01:49:36,282
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's difficult, but again,

761
01:49:37,297 --> 01:49:45,062
[SPEAKER_15]: When John talked about this years ago, this is an avenue that we looked at, both of us having children at the same age and saying,

762
01:49:46,353 --> 01:49:47,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, we were fortunate.

763
01:49:47,653 --> 01:49:51,375
[SPEAKER_15]: The days of my father looking at me and saying, you know, Dad, it's not fair.

764
01:49:51,415 --> 01:49:52,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to buy a home in Medford.

765
01:49:53,015 --> 01:49:54,236
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I work hard.

766
01:49:54,256 --> 01:49:55,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I graduated college.

767
01:49:55,256 --> 01:49:58,837
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, you really want to stay in Medford with his Italian accent?

768
01:49:58,857 --> 01:49:59,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, yeah.

769
01:49:59,738 --> 01:50:01,979
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, you can't afford to want to want a job?

770
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:02,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, no.

771
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,279
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, go get a two job.

772
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:05,940
[SPEAKER_15]: If two jobs don't do it, go get a three job.

773
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,341
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, it was easy back then.

774
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:11,482
[SPEAKER_15]: I got three jobs and I bought a home in Medford.

775
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:13,772
[SPEAKER_15]: to this day still have three jobs.

776
01:50:14,172 --> 01:50:20,156
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not easy, but I understand that we're trying to advocate for people that don't have that avenue, that opportunity.

777
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:28,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I think that, I think we're all in agreement that we have to find a better way to communicate because this work is amazing.

778
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:37,285
[SPEAKER_15]: This is great work, but it seems like it just, when you look at it in the conversations I've had with people, it's like, oh, we really only reach 70 people.

779
01:50:37,526 --> 01:50:39,447
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not true, but that's what it reads.

780
01:50:40,558 --> 01:50:41,598
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, thank you.

781
01:50:41,798 --> 01:50:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate, I appreciate the feedback.

782
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:51,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, like I said, I would love to sit down and figure out other ways of making sure that, because there was a lot of work that was put in.

783
01:50:51,261 --> 01:50:52,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to belittle it.

784
01:50:53,002 --> 01:50:53,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to hold it up.

785
01:50:53,842 --> 01:50:56,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it's something that we need to move forward with because Roberta's correct.

786
01:50:57,463 --> 01:50:59,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever happens still has to come to this council.

787
01:50:59,624 --> 01:51:01,725
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, who's it fall back on?

788
01:51:01,745 --> 01:51:03,705
[SPEAKER_15]: This council is going to have to look at people and say what?

789
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:06,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we did.

790
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we get the message the word the messaging out.

791
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:10,301
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't.

792
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:13,062
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not us that are holding the bag on this.

793
01:51:13,242 --> 01:51:14,262
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

794
01:51:14,943 --> 01:51:15,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

795
01:51:15,923 --> 01:51:18,804
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to Councilor Levin.

796
01:51:21,185 --> 01:51:21,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

797
01:51:22,165 --> 01:51:29,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to clarify we currently we did pass an update to our linkage to our linkage fee programs.

798
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:30,168
[SPEAKER_13]: We

799
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:39,817
[SPEAKER_13]: This very council voted on a study to allocate a portion of the linkage fees to affordable housing.

800
01:51:40,457 --> 01:51:43,260
[SPEAKER_13]: The affordable housing trust in

801
01:51:44,222 --> 01:51:55,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Collaboration with the planning office is currently looking at fractional incentives as another mechanism for funding the Affordable Housing Trust.

802
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:56,987
[SPEAKER_13]: All of those come from developers.

803
01:51:58,687 --> 01:52:11,752
[SPEAKER_13]: The CPC is the one current revenue source that does come directly from taxpayers, and taxpayers have been paying into the CPC for years now,

804
01:52:14,744 --> 01:52:18,467
[SPEAKER_13]: benefits the community as a whole in a very public way.

805
01:52:18,567 --> 01:52:20,508
[SPEAKER_13]: I previously served on the CBC.

806
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:32,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you can pretty much take any item on any council agenda and spin it up in a negative way.

807
01:52:32,717 --> 01:52:38,541
[SPEAKER_13]: You can take any item from a multi-page report and come up with a way to

808
01:52:40,756 --> 01:52:46,924
[SPEAKER_13]: come up with a way to rabble rouse or be negative about it.

809
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:54,174
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the end of the day, most people are excited that we're actually getting some infrastructure to fund affordable housing off the floor.

810
01:52:57,766 --> 01:53:12,572
[SPEAKER_13]: just voted on a plan to fund some sort of a public relations professional to help us out with the rezoning process for a project within a set period of time.

811
01:53:13,395 --> 01:53:18,760
[SPEAKER_13]: The people on, the people serving on the Affordable Housing Trust are volunteers.

812
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:23,625
[SPEAKER_13]: They did the best that they could when coming up with the survey.

813
01:53:23,785 --> 01:53:29,250
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that 71 people replied.

814
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:32,954
[SPEAKER_13]: You said that two people might have lived outside of Medford.

815
01:53:32,974 --> 01:53:35,876
[SPEAKER_13]: You also quoted a, well,

816
01:53:36,615 --> 01:53:45,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Members of this council also quoted a petition of a thousand people, about half of whom lived outside the city to support one of their arguments recently.

817
01:53:46,059 --> 01:53:53,621
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I would just like to say that the vast majority of people are excited to see this happen.

818
01:53:53,641 --> 01:54:01,484
[SPEAKER_13]: The vast majority of people are excited to support the Affordable Housing Trust in the most positive light possible.

819
01:54:01,504 --> 01:54:06,126
[SPEAKER_13]: We are coming up with ways to fund it, which are

820
01:54:07,193 --> 01:54:10,875
[SPEAKER_13]: by and large, which by and large come from developers.

821
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:19,738
[SPEAKER_13]: And I personally feel that everything I saw in the presentation is

822
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:29,983
[SPEAKER_13]: very positive and I don't see any reason to throw any sort of shade on it.

823
01:54:30,503 --> 01:54:35,545
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for your time and for the time that you put into this presentation.

824
01:54:35,905 --> 01:54:38,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, I'm grateful for all the work that you're putting into this.

825
01:54:39,286 --> 01:54:41,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

826
01:54:43,785 --> 01:54:44,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

827
01:54:45,266 --> 01:54:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I genuinely want to thank you for all the work that you're doing.

828
01:54:50,111 --> 01:55:03,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there is a real difference and people may not realize that technically affordable housing that qualifies as affordable according to the state or the federal government,

829
01:55:05,305 --> 01:55:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: might not even be below the average price of a two-unit or a three-unit, sorry, two-bedroom or three-bedroom place that we already have in Medford.

830
01:55:16,472 --> 01:55:25,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically, the difference between technically affordable housing and actually affordable housing is crucially important, and this, your organization is really

831
01:55:26,858 --> 01:55:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that work of looking at how we can provide actually affordable housing here in Medford.

832
01:55:33,481 --> 01:55:40,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think especially about the many seniors who are not wealthy.

833
01:55:41,003 --> 01:55:42,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of seniors in Medford.

834
01:55:42,924 --> 01:55:47,006
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of seniors who are low income on fixed incomes.

835
01:55:48,666 --> 01:55:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: When I have knocked doors, I talk to, I can't believe how many people I talk to who are over 65

836
01:55:56,009 --> 01:56:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: and are looking in some fear to the day where they can no longer upkeep their home.

837
01:56:04,392 --> 01:56:09,494
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to move out of their community and their lifelong friends and family.

838
01:56:09,855 --> 01:56:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet there is nowhere to downsize in our city.

839
01:56:13,796 --> 01:56:20,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So I so much appreciate the work that you are doing because it is, I believe, crucially important for

840
01:56:21,424 --> 01:56:28,733
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even this large segment of homeowning fixed income seniors.

841
01:56:28,933 --> 01:56:36,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that solving that problem, which I am also trying to do with a couple of other projects, is genuinely crucially important.

842
01:56:36,803 --> 01:56:39,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very large group of people.

843
01:56:41,146 --> 01:56:54,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to recognize that 47% of Medford, I believe is what you were saying, are renters, and that renters are people too, and renters are affected by affordable housing.

844
01:56:55,116 --> 01:57:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, you know, we cannot only rely upon the opinions of homeowners to understand the needs of the residents of Medford.

845
01:57:06,605 --> 01:57:08,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I want to

846
01:57:09,865 --> 01:57:33,892
[SPEAKER_02]: While I appreciate that people may find the idea of a real estate transfer fee or other possible funding mechanisms scary, I think it's vitally important that the Affordable Housing Trust look into all the possibilities of how we can fund affordable housing here in Medford.

847
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:38,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that you don't leave anything out.

848
01:57:38,037 --> 01:57:50,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it's important that we not create a taboo against anyone mentioning these possible ways that we can support and fund affordable housing here in Medford.

849
01:57:51,513 --> 01:57:52,914
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be talking about them.

850
01:57:54,576 --> 01:57:57,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only through talking about them in realistic ways.

851
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,023
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, this is fantastic education for the public.

852
01:58:02,704 --> 01:58:15,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 98% about what our needs are, what we currently have, lots of data, possibilities of action plans, things we can do, all of those things.

853
01:58:18,298 --> 01:58:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that mentioning these possible ways that we could fund it, whether they are ones that will get passed or ones that won't get passed, things that the community will have input on, I think is the perfect way to educate the community.

854
01:58:31,166 --> 01:58:33,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very much appreciate you bringing those up.

855
01:58:33,528 --> 01:58:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure that we do not, in this chamber, make it so that it is a taboo for anyone to mention them.

856
01:58:41,706 --> 01:58:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only way that we, that our community will begin the process of being able to discuss any of these topics.

857
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for your work.

858
01:58:54,232 --> 01:58:55,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

859
01:58:55,452 --> 01:58:56,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazaro.

860
01:58:58,814 --> 01:58:59,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

861
01:58:59,294 --> 01:59:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, most of what I was, most of what I was going to say was

862
01:59:06,825 --> 01:59:10,267
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that Councillor Callaghan said beautifully.

863
01:59:11,847 --> 01:59:14,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to reiterate 47 percent.

864
01:59:14,889 --> 01:59:21,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the the data that you put in the report is really illuminating about the city.

865
01:59:22,152 --> 01:59:30,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciated learning about the shift to younger professionals that are in roommate situations.

866
01:59:31,057 --> 01:59:31,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that

867
01:59:32,894 --> 01:59:37,337
[SPEAKER_07]: illuminates a lot about the direction the city is moving.

868
01:59:38,157 --> 01:59:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it means that we should look toward those people, talk to them more, engage them more as a city.

869
01:59:46,942 --> 01:59:52,525
[SPEAKER_07]: 47% renters is critical to consider.

870
01:59:54,587 --> 02:00:01,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And the housing cost burden falling so heavily on our seniors is also super, super critical

871
02:00:02,392 --> 02:00:08,097
[SPEAKER_07]: for us to keep in mind as we balance how to move forward with our affordable housing needs.

872
02:00:08,537 --> 02:00:18,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just want to caution my colleagues that you know concerns about the way that we are communicating about things like this.

873
02:00:19,286 --> 02:00:28,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need to necessarily be too worried about the way that people discuss these

874
02:00:29,682 --> 02:00:34,226
[SPEAKER_07]: reports on social media because often somebody may have an axe to grind.

875
02:00:34,246 --> 02:00:37,409
[SPEAKER_07]: There may be an angle that somebody is trying to access.

876
02:00:37,549 --> 02:00:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's necessarily more to do with how many people you surveyed.

877
02:00:42,974 --> 02:00:45,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean most of this report isn't even really about the survey.

878
02:00:45,957 --> 02:00:50,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mostly about the facts of Medford and who lives here and what their needs are.

879
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:55,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we consider how best to

880
02:00:56,091 --> 02:01:00,675
[SPEAKER_07]: approach the needs of the city looking at the data is an excellent way to do that.

881
02:01:01,375 --> 02:01:10,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I did also want to know if the presentation will be accessible to the public after the slides if that will be accessible somewhere.

882
02:01:10,162 --> 02:01:24,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the report is in our material so that's public record and people can find that on the Web site the City Council Web site which is if you go to medfordma.org you go to City Council you can see the materials for

883
02:01:26,468 --> 02:01:33,918
[SPEAKER_07]: today's meeting under the agenda, but I just wanted to know if you have the slides available.

884
02:01:36,210 --> 02:01:36,650
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be great.

885
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:42,895
[SPEAKER_12]: If they could be placed on the Affordable Housing Trust site and then I'll upload them and attach them to this meeting as well.

886
02:01:42,915 --> 02:01:43,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that would be great.

887
02:01:43,795 --> 02:01:57,985
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just a lot of helpful information for people who are curious about like who, who lives in Medford, who, where the needs are and how the Affordable Housing Trust is pointing the help in that direction.

888
02:01:58,345 --> 02:01:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thank you for your work.

889
02:02:00,246 --> 02:02:00,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

890
02:02:01,227 --> 02:02:02,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Council Vice President Collins.

891
02:02:04,614 --> 02:02:05,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Behrs.

892
02:02:05,715 --> 02:02:07,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you both so much for being here.

893
02:02:07,515 --> 02:02:17,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, through you, I would like to thank the entire affordable, um, housing trust trustees for your hard work over these past, um, few years.

894
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it 2021 or 2022 that the trust fund was officially inaugurated?

895
02:02:22,942 --> 02:02:23,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember.

896
02:02:23,843 --> 02:02:24,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Early 2023 we passed it.

897
02:02:25,203 --> 02:02:25,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Early 2023.

898
02:02:26,204 --> 02:02:28,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Appointments weren't made until July, 2024.

899
02:02:29,336 --> 02:02:30,437
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, that's right.

900
02:02:31,258 --> 02:02:34,360
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of work for two years.

901
02:02:34,901 --> 02:02:46,210
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really impressive, and this is mission-driven work, so I'm sure that everybody serving on this commission would have liked to have started 20 years ago, if not more.

902
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:58,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a lot of ground to cover in just two years, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for diving into this with so much gusto and amassing all the resources that you could on such short time, you know, I think,

903
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:03,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how Counselor Lazaro just kind of framed it in her remarks.

904
02:03:04,583 --> 02:03:24,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about people's feelings about the problem, and we should, and most of the time we just spend talking about the problem, and that's how the conversation could go, and I appreciate that the report is largely about the facts of the crisis of displacement and uncertainty and unaffordability in Medford, which we know touches

905
02:03:26,572 --> 02:03:28,373
[SPEAKER_00]: all facets of our demography.

906
02:03:28,633 --> 02:03:31,675
[SPEAKER_00]: It touches seniors, people who have lived here their entire lives.

907
02:03:31,735 --> 02:03:41,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It touches young adults who would like to stay here or like to move here and people who are, you know, have been putting down roots in Medford and finding it increasingly hard to do so.

908
02:03:44,987 --> 02:03:49,151
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really, it's a disproportionate slice of our population.

909
02:03:50,392 --> 02:03:55,897
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know this better than anyone, because you spend your time in the data, and you spend your time trying to match the strategies with the data.

910
02:03:57,619 --> 02:03:58,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that

911
02:03:59,958 --> 02:04:05,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that your report does an excellent job of just framing the problem for what it is that we have a problem.

912
02:04:05,586 --> 02:04:06,367
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not new.

913
02:04:06,407 --> 02:04:08,009
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been escalating for a long time.

914
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:13,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are trying to play catch up in amassing the strategies and the resources to combat it.

915
02:04:15,438 --> 02:04:18,320
[SPEAKER_00]: at the scale and with the urgency that it deserves.

916
02:04:19,081 --> 02:04:28,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have always really appreciated about the scope of an affordable housing trust ever since I first started hearing about it from Councilor Falco before I was on the council.

917
02:04:28,848 --> 02:04:39,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the things I was most excited to get to talk about when I was first elected because it was still on our body even when Councilor Falco was no longer in the chambers after having proposed it.

918
02:04:40,256 --> 02:04:45,541
[SPEAKER_00]: was that this is a body that can encompass so many different strategies.

919
02:04:48,828 --> 02:04:53,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many different strategies that target the things that people really complain about that are not happening.

920
02:04:53,792 --> 02:04:58,276
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's been a lot of times we've been in these chambers and people have said, what's going on with this property?

921
02:04:58,316 --> 02:04:59,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could do something there.

922
02:05:00,999 --> 02:05:05,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why don't we have more housing for seniors to downsize into?

923
02:05:05,743 --> 02:05:13,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why should it be so hard that young people can't move here when they want to start a family like me or my peers did decades ago?

924
02:05:15,335 --> 02:05:20,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Affordable Housing Trust can be a container to have all of those conversations.

925
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:26,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's, I don't think that it's wrong to have frank discussions about what strategies

926
02:05:28,143 --> 02:05:40,512
[SPEAKER_00]: people find it easy to say yes to, and what strategies people really need to hear more about, and need to understand, and need context for, and need specificity about to understand how they fit into our life here at Medford.

927
02:05:41,353 --> 02:05:52,902
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about those, I think that we also need to equally spend time on, or just at least acknowledge, and I think that we all do, all of us in this room, I'm not just talking about behind this rail, but even, you know,

928
02:05:53,462 --> 02:05:56,823
[SPEAKER_00]: people come here, even when we're talking about very controversial topics.

929
02:05:56,843 --> 02:05:59,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember about a year and a half ago, we were talking about rent control.

930
02:05:59,744 --> 02:06:00,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably my fault.

931
02:06:02,165 --> 02:06:08,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody came in who was there for some totally other paper, and they got up and they said, you know, I didn't come here to talk about rent control.

932
02:06:09,427 --> 02:06:15,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I support rent control, but I know that I don't support my neighbors getting displaced out of this community.

933
02:06:17,497 --> 02:06:30,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when we're talking about the work of the Affordable Housing Trust, it's very clear to me that everybody in our community, regardless of how they tend to characterize what strategies they prefer politically, we know that we don't want our neighbors to get displaced.

934
02:06:31,324 --> 02:06:33,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that it needs to be easier for people to afford to stay here.

935
02:06:33,665 --> 02:06:37,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that really unifies us on this side of the rail, on that side of the rail.

936
02:06:39,207 --> 02:06:40,187
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has to be data-driven.

937
02:06:40,888 --> 02:06:58,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really glad that our work is starting there with just, again, putting numbers in a report that, you know, not the MAPC and not another agency owns, but something that Medford owns, putting numbers in a report that Medford owns to what is the scale of the problem, a snapshot for this year compared to 10 years ago.

938
02:06:59,334 --> 02:07:05,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we continue to do the work that you've been doing for two years, we just try to enfranchise the trust with the resources.

939
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:34,378
[SPEAKER_00]: to be putting forward those loans, to be making those grants if you choose to do so, to be building the capacity to do real work in the community in the future so that we know that we're matching the scale of the problem, that two-thirds of the households that are below 50% area median income, the two-thirds of that number that are housing cost burdened, which is a huge number, huge number of our neighbors that are housing cost burdened,

940
02:07:36,452 --> 02:07:46,979
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that we are doing the work that we know the community is enthusiastic about, which is doing the work of making it easier to live here and easier to stay here no matter who you are.

941
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:49,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that everybody wants to see.

942
02:07:51,062 --> 02:07:54,085
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you order that list of strategies, I know that's something that everybody wants to see.

943
02:07:54,105 --> 02:08:01,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say one more thing.

944
02:08:04,183 --> 02:08:04,843
[SPEAKER_00]: But I forget what it is.

945
02:08:06,404 --> 02:08:15,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a really great start, and I want to affirm the same point that I think all of my fellow counselors have been making, which is perhaps to reframe it.

946
02:08:16,488 --> 02:08:23,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I think occasionally when people hear about strategies, they get scared, because many strategies have been maligned, and of course there's pros and cons to everything.

947
02:08:24,232 --> 02:08:33,577
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other side, I think the other advantage to talking about things more and better is that when we share the strategies that the Affordable Housing Trust is looking to do more and better of, people get excited.

948
02:08:34,637 --> 02:08:40,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, finally, finally, we're going to be developing strategies that actually cut to the heart of this issue.

949
02:08:41,221 --> 02:08:41,901
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exciting.

950
02:08:41,961 --> 02:08:42,822
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get involved?

951
02:08:43,182 --> 02:08:43,962
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I contribute?

952
02:08:44,002 --> 02:08:44,663
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I volunteer?

953
02:08:44,703 --> 02:08:45,303
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I donate?

954
02:08:49,381 --> 02:09:12,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for your work so far, and I hope that this council can be a partner to you in not only supporting your work, but also making sure that it's broadcast out to the community, both the folks who are paying attention and the folks who are marginalized by the economics of our region, and for that reason are so much harder to reach with outreach and surveys like the ones that inform this report.

955
02:09:12,583 --> 02:09:12,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

956
02:09:13,344 --> 02:09:13,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

957
02:09:13,784 --> 02:09:14,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Sang.

958
02:09:15,652 --> 02:09:16,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

959
02:09:16,372 --> 02:09:19,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited to be one of your partners on the council for this work.

960
02:09:20,915 --> 02:09:31,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think all of us tonight have underscored the importance of affordability and the importance of letting people be able to stay here and call, keep calling Medford home.

961
02:09:32,902 --> 02:09:38,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know a few of us have, are, you know, in that position where,

962
02:09:40,995 --> 02:09:43,376
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking to stay and it's looking increasingly difficult.

963
02:09:44,196 --> 02:09:50,777
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's much to say about the regional housing market, about greater market forces too.

964
02:09:51,297 --> 02:09:55,198
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that we can all acknowledge that this is a huge problem.

965
02:09:55,738 --> 02:09:58,059
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a problem that touches generations, right?

966
02:09:58,139 --> 02:10:07,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think you acknowledged earlier in the report or in the presentation the intergenerational layer of this, that dimension

967
02:10:09,166 --> 02:10:13,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Seniors finding it hard and young people finding it hard and family types changing.

968
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:20,315
[SPEAKER_10]: And changing what that means for the city of Medford and the type of housing we need to invest in and create in this city.

969
02:10:23,277 --> 02:10:29,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the Affordable Housing Trust as an important tool in the toolbox in this fight against rising costs.

970
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:37,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you guys acknowledge how big of a task it is in this report.

971
02:10:37,802 --> 02:10:43,104
[SPEAKER_10]: When you talk about, you know, these are the other tools we need to advocate for and invest in.

972
02:10:43,124 --> 02:10:43,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I hear

973
02:10:46,782 --> 02:10:53,428
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, some members of the community who are concerned about, you know, small aspects of what was in the greater report.

974
02:10:53,889 --> 02:11:02,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do commend people to take a look at the comprehensive product that you guys have produced and at the slides that you guys have produced tonight.

975
02:11:02,576 --> 02:11:12,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think what you guys are saying is that we have these priorities that are, you know, immediately in front of us that aren't as, you know,

976
02:11:14,128 --> 02:11:22,930
[SPEAKER_10]: big policy objectives rather, but, you know, investing in community housing, investing in preserving affordable housing here.

977
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:31,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And those things, I assume, are going to be a very big part, if not a huge part, of what you guys do moving forward.

978
02:11:31,593 --> 02:11:36,054
[SPEAKER_10]: And when it comes to all these other tools and mechanisms we need to be looking at,

979
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:43,822
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that requires partnership, right, with the city council and building community support and getting input.

980
02:11:44,202 --> 02:11:52,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, you know, as Councilor Collins alluded to earlier, you know, we've seen that already in the past with some of the items that are in here.

981
02:11:53,684 --> 02:11:59,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the community has come out in support or in opposition and, you know, everyone holds their views but they make their views known.

982
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:06,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And this action plan isn't the end of the conversation, rather it starts the conversation.

983
02:12:07,228 --> 02:12:09,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's so important.

984
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:13,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to put out bold ideas so that we can have a conversation about them.

985
02:12:13,933 --> 02:12:20,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually putting out those ideas in the first place creates more feedback and more input and more conversation about them.

986
02:12:20,538 --> 02:12:27,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a really good thing that you guys have been so comprehensive in your work in this action plan.

987
02:12:27,062 --> 02:12:28,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really impressed reading it.

988
02:12:28,724 --> 02:12:36,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say, I am really, you know, we can make a lot of hay about one very tiny part of the work that you guys have been doing.

989
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:50,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But reading through the report, you, the focus groups of stakeholders, the market survey and, you know, all the community surveys and analyzing that data, there's so much other work that you have already done to create this action plan.

990
02:12:51,006 --> 02:12:56,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really, really important to acknowledge and commend you all for that work.

991
02:12:56,752 --> 02:13:11,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you so much and I look forward to helping you see through this action plan to see what we can do on the council to help you guys with your efforts as well and in welcoming the community to join in and be a part of that conversation.

992
02:13:14,798 --> 02:13:15,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

993
02:13:16,258 --> 02:13:17,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys for your presentation.

994
02:13:18,839 --> 02:13:20,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Really appreciate the dialogue on this.

995
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:32,802
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I understand how much work you guys put in here and I know how much work so many people put in to lots of things that make our city run.

996
02:13:33,342 --> 02:13:42,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also know that a lot of that work is happening because we don't have the city resources and city funding, in my opinion, to set our city up

997
02:13:44,356 --> 02:13:57,419
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's really, you know, maybe a bridge between some of the perspectives we've heard tonight is like, what does it look like for the city of Medford to set up our boards and our commissions and our committees and our task forces for success?

998
02:13:58,039 --> 02:13:59,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a really strong report.

999
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:02,761
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a ton of detailed information, data analysis.

1000
02:14:03,681 --> 02:14:04,821
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate that.

1001
02:14:05,181 --> 02:14:07,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you guys are on the same page.

1002
02:14:07,722 --> 02:14:10,262
[SPEAKER_12]: You would have loved that survey to be 140 people instead of 70 or 280 instead of 140.

1003
02:14:13,083 --> 02:14:15,885
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the question is, like, what is it going to take for us to get there?

1004
02:14:16,406 --> 02:14:22,671
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what does making sure that the staff who worked with you have the tools to get more outreach?

1005
02:14:22,691 --> 02:14:28,296
[SPEAKER_12]: What does it look like for more people to be engaged in the different ways that our city communicates with people?

1006
02:14:28,696 --> 02:14:33,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I do think, you know, it makes things harder when we don't have that.

1007
02:14:34,521 --> 02:14:41,387
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's, I think, where I can agree with Councilor Scarpelli, while I can also agree with all my other colleagues on all of their comments.

1008
02:14:42,547 --> 02:14:48,231
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's a great start and you're working really hard and you did the best with what we have as a city right now.

1009
02:14:48,711 --> 02:14:55,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the question is, just like the question is on affordable housing, we're doing good work, but we need to do more.

1010
02:14:55,956 --> 02:14:57,677
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need a lot more affordable housing.

1011
02:14:58,357 --> 02:15:01,299
[SPEAKER_12]: We need you guys to have more than $300,000.

1012
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,301
[SPEAKER_12]: We need the CPC to have more support.

1013
02:15:04,341 --> 02:15:06,263
[SPEAKER_12]: We need everybody to really have,

1014
02:15:07,809 --> 02:15:12,333
[SPEAKER_12]: more resources to thrive because we need more affordable housing so that people who want to live here can thrive.

1015
02:15:12,793 --> 02:15:17,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's hopefully a bridge that we can have between all the different perspectives we've shared tonight.

1016
02:15:19,059 --> 02:15:27,186
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can do our work to lift up the amazing work that you've done so far and fight to make sure that you have the resources you need to do even more.

1017
02:15:27,966 --> 02:15:30,148
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where I'm coming down on it.

1018
02:15:30,208 --> 02:15:31,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just really want to thank you.

1019
02:15:33,132 --> 02:15:35,353
[SPEAKER_12]: because I'd love more people to be hearing about what you're doing.

1020
02:15:35,773 --> 02:15:36,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know you guys would love that.

1021
02:15:37,034 --> 02:15:52,983
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, it wasn't something you guys were doing, but I walked in to Room 201 a few weeks ago, and some folks from our PDS office were holding a session on the rehab program.

1022
02:15:53,003 --> 02:15:54,504
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the rehab grant program, right?

1023
02:15:54,984 --> 02:15:59,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had all of these amazing resources, and they had had successful, other successful forms of outreach.

1024
02:15:59,907 --> 02:16:02,228
[SPEAKER_12]: But that day, I don't know if anybody walked in.

1025
02:16:02,539 --> 02:16:06,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's kind of the, how do we get that out there more?

1026
02:16:06,521 --> 02:16:09,803
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we make sure that people know more about what's going on in our city?

1027
02:16:10,644 --> 02:16:11,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's good.

1028
02:16:12,165 --> 02:16:15,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really, I hope, the thing that we can try to provide.

1029
02:16:15,307 --> 02:16:16,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really want to thank you for.

1030
02:16:17,895 --> 02:16:20,436
[SPEAKER_12]: bringing this before us and presenting it.

1031
02:16:21,056 --> 02:16:23,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to see this action plan succeed.

1032
02:16:23,337 --> 02:16:32,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope that in five years when we're doing the next action plan, we're talking about, you know, $3 million, not $300,000, maybe even more than that.

1033
02:16:32,601 --> 02:16:42,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we can help with that with our linkage fee work and inclusionary fractional and some of the stuff that's in this report that I think is on our fingertips in the next few months to try to get implemented.

1034
02:16:44,226 --> 02:16:45,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my piece.

1035
02:16:46,452 --> 02:16:47,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that.

1036
02:16:47,654 --> 02:16:49,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any, do you need us to vote on this?

1037
02:16:50,018 --> 02:16:51,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you just wanted to present it to share?

1038
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:52,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, yeah.

1039
02:16:55,715 --> 02:16:55,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1040
02:16:56,575 --> 02:16:57,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much.

1041
02:17:00,016 --> 02:17:00,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1042
02:17:00,557 --> 02:17:05,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to, oh, we do have one comment online.

1043
02:17:05,498 --> 02:17:07,479
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like we have some public comment.

1044
02:17:08,019 --> 02:17:14,961
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's anyone who wants to comment on this paper, either in person or on Zoom, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

1045
02:17:15,542 --> 02:17:18,042
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will start on Zoom right now.

1046
02:17:19,123 --> 02:17:20,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Micah, name and address for the record, please.

1047
02:17:20,883 --> 02:17:22,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll have three minutes.

1048
02:17:23,324 --> 02:17:25,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1049
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:49,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a question for the housing trust that I want to get to, but I do first also want to make the comment that it is frustrating to see the council platform FUD driven by people who aren't providing any sort of reasoned

1050
02:17:52,266 --> 02:18:03,091
[SPEAKER_09]: analysis to for their criticisms of something like this 70 is not necessarily a bad sample size.

1051
02:18:03,951 --> 02:18:07,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a lot of that depends on methodology and a bunch of other things.

1052
02:18:08,462 --> 02:18:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: aspects that anyone who's looked at survey science for a little bit can explain to you.

1053
02:18:14,304 --> 02:18:21,486
[SPEAKER_09]: But just criticizing this because it only has 70 respondents is nonsense.

1054
02:18:22,266 --> 02:18:28,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that said, thank you very much for presenting this.

1055
02:18:28,148 --> 02:18:29,668
[SPEAKER_09]: This was really great to hear.

1056
02:18:29,688 --> 02:18:30,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really interesting data.

1057
02:18:31,729 --> 02:18:35,209
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is related to whether or not you had

1058
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:50,012
[SPEAKER_09]: any observations or inferences you could make about changes that you're seeing to the demographics of families with children?

1059
02:18:50,212 --> 02:18:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Because your data shows that there's a 2% drop in households with young children in Medford.

1060
02:18:58,934 --> 02:19:04,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And presumably, going hand-in-hand with the increased cost to move into Medford,

1061
02:19:04,835 --> 02:19:16,598
[SPEAKER_09]: That means that those children are from increasingly narrower, more homogeneous, possibly demographics.

1062
02:19:16,778 --> 02:19:27,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So and, you know, that is that is a concern, too, because for those of us with children, we want our children to grow up in a diverse city as well and have

1063
02:19:29,896 --> 02:19:32,937
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, all the benefits and things that are great that go along with that.

1064
02:19:33,017 --> 02:19:39,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I just wanted to know if there's any data you were able to sort of extract from on that ground.

1065
02:19:42,841 --> 02:19:43,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1066
02:19:43,141 --> 02:19:47,463
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to go through everything and then I'll write down the questions and we'll see what we got.

1067
02:19:47,503 --> 02:19:50,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to Lisa Serio on Zoom.

1068
02:19:50,945 --> 02:19:52,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Lisa, name and address for the record, please.

1069
02:19:52,965 --> 02:19:53,646
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

1070
02:19:55,687 --> 02:19:56,887
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Lisa Serio.

1071
02:19:56,927 --> 02:19:58,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 19 Paul Road.

1072
02:19:58,368 --> 02:19:59,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

1073
02:20:00,207 --> 02:20:00,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1074
02:20:01,008 --> 02:20:01,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

1075
02:20:02,009 --> 02:20:04,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to, I just had a question.

1076
02:20:04,931 --> 02:20:15,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I understand the statement, but Councilor Lemme mentioned shade on the market survey, like he doesn't want shade put on the market survey.

1077
02:20:15,401 --> 02:20:16,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Is shade a negative?

1078
02:20:16,722 --> 02:20:17,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Is shade like

1079
02:20:18,194 --> 02:20:31,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want somebody to say something negative about like the number of people that participated in the survey, because I think it's important to understand that 70 people

1080
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:37,393
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the data analyzed with 70 people.

1081
02:20:37,433 --> 02:20:50,283
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of important for me to know as a voter and as a constituent in Medford that I understand that that's how many people were taking part in the market survey.

1082
02:20:50,923 --> 02:20:52,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a negative.

1083
02:20:52,945 --> 02:20:56,608
[SPEAKER_01]: He said something about shade and it took me a minute to understand.

1084
02:20:56,628 --> 02:20:58,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he saying that negatively?

1085
02:20:58,769 --> 02:21:00,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me it's important.

1086
02:21:01,771 --> 02:21:05,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to know that, like, I don't understand why he said it that way.

1087
02:21:06,594 --> 02:21:10,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Also counselor Callahan and Collins and Lazaro.

1088
02:21:11,633 --> 02:21:14,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm of the same mindset as George Scott Pelley.

1089
02:21:15,056 --> 02:21:18,279
[SPEAKER_01]: When I told my dad I wanted to live in Medford, he said, OK, good.

1090
02:21:18,299 --> 02:21:22,142
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to get like two jobs, you know.

1091
02:21:22,162 --> 02:21:24,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I worked at British Airways and Tufts University.

1092
02:21:24,804 --> 02:21:26,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked two jobs, seven days a week.

1093
02:21:26,745 --> 02:21:28,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could afford a house in Medford.

1094
02:21:29,327 --> 02:21:38,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, in order for housing to be affordable, I had to kick butt to get money to get a house in Medford.

1095
02:21:39,515 --> 02:21:45,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way I could afford a house in Medford, just working a ton of jobs.

1096
02:21:45,979 --> 02:21:48,620
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way I could afford a house in Medford.

1097
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:49,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have parents.

1098
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,681
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were immigrants.

1099
02:21:50,761 --> 02:21:54,043
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't give me money to buy a house in Medford.

1100
02:21:54,123 --> 02:21:57,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way I got my house in Medford.

1101
02:21:57,685 --> 02:22:07,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to say, though, that even though you may think that I, at 71, want to downsize, I do not want to downsize at all.

1102
02:22:08,135 --> 02:22:10,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I am aging in place.

1103
02:22:10,438 --> 02:22:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I have set my house up.

1104
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I live around the neighbors I want to live around.

1105
02:22:16,004 --> 02:22:18,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I live around the young neighbors I want to live around.

1106
02:22:18,707 --> 02:22:21,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am not going to downsize in any way.

1107
02:22:21,851 --> 02:22:25,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I am staying in my house that I'm living in.

1108
02:22:25,856 --> 02:22:27,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to figure out a way

1109
02:22:28,068 --> 02:22:31,871
[SPEAKER_01]: to make ends meet like a lot of other constituents in Medford.

1110
02:22:32,491 --> 02:22:36,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a job, work, even if you're 71, come on, man, you gotta go back to work.

1111
02:22:36,313 --> 02:22:37,234
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you gotta do it.

1112
02:22:37,594 --> 02:22:41,477
[SPEAKER_01]: If y'all gonna bring the taxes up for me, that's fine, I'm just going back to work.

1113
02:22:41,677 --> 02:22:46,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a person to rent a room, but I'm not gonna downsize.

1114
02:22:47,161 --> 02:22:48,361
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my idea.

1115
02:22:48,381 --> 02:22:55,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of people in my neighborhood, there are older people that are living all alone in the house, and that's what we're all saying.

1116
02:22:55,286 --> 02:22:56,407
[SPEAKER_01]: We are aging in place.

1117
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:02,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say that and get clarity on what shade is, because I didn't understand that.

1118
02:23:02,948 --> 02:23:03,148
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1119
02:23:03,208 --> 02:23:03,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1120
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:05,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Lisa.

1121
02:23:06,573 --> 02:23:10,999
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go next to Marie.

1122
02:23:11,079 --> 02:23:13,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Marie, name and address for the record, please.

1123
02:23:13,101 --> 02:23:14,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll have three minutes.

1124
02:23:15,966 --> 02:23:20,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Marie Angel from, I live on Frozen Road in Medford.

1125
02:23:20,869 --> 02:23:28,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want to thank Roberta and the other ladies, I can't remember her name.

1126
02:23:28,854 --> 02:23:30,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Marie, it's pretty muffled.

1127
02:23:30,755 --> 02:23:34,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you, could you, sorry.

1128
02:23:34,658 --> 02:23:36,659
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty muffled.

1129
02:23:36,679 --> 02:23:38,980
[SPEAKER_12]: We're having a hard time hearing you.

1130
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know why.

1131
02:23:40,861 --> 02:23:41,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1132
02:23:42,562 --> 02:23:45,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll try back.

1133
02:23:45,916 --> 02:23:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can try back later.

1134
02:23:50,139 --> 02:23:51,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I can probably say that.

1135
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still trying to hear me?

1136
02:23:54,462 --> 02:23:56,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's still very muffled.

1137
02:23:56,423 --> 02:23:59,525
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna go to the next commenter, then I'll come back to you.

1138
02:23:59,565 --> 02:24:09,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe put it on speakerphone or I don't know if you're, you know, I'm not exactly sure what your microphone situation is, but I'm gonna go to Robert and then I'll come back to you, Marie.

1139
02:24:16,378 --> 02:24:21,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6.

1140
02:24:22,662 --> 02:24:24,983
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, thanks for the presentation.

1141
02:24:26,544 --> 02:24:35,349
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife and I are recent homeowners in Medford, comfortable middle class salary, and we could barely afford to buy a place here, so totally get what you're saying.

1142
02:24:37,330 --> 02:24:39,812
[SPEAKER_11]: One suggestion I would have when thinking about

1143
02:24:40,786 --> 02:24:58,784
[SPEAKER_11]: this plan here to solve your initiatives is when thinking about like middle class, working class people too, in your presentation you talked about expanding tenant protections, I believe, or it might have been some of your backup documents, but I'd also like to also add

1144
02:24:59,565 --> 02:25:17,294
[SPEAKER_11]: for consideration too is also thinking about really helping especially like working class landlords to also know, have the resource to know a like, not only how to be good landlords, but also how to like protect themselves from, you know, unnecessary risk.

1145
02:25:17,455 --> 02:25:21,997
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a recent news article from NBC 10 that was talking about

1146
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:36,461
[SPEAKER_11]: know, these professional tenants who have learned how to scam the system by going place to place and kind of trashing properties and, you know, things like that can also really leave small town, small time landlords, you know, in the lurch.

1147
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:41,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think you're thinking about that as well, because I would say that, you know, there's a lot of, you know,

1148
02:25:42,285 --> 02:25:58,939
[SPEAKER_11]: working class people in Medford who might be relying on, you know, rental income from a two or three family property, who I think would just, you know, benefit from really having support in the community to be able to maintain their property, but also protect their property rights too.

1149
02:25:59,140 --> 02:25:59,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1150
02:26:01,281 --> 02:26:01,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1151
02:26:04,004 --> 02:26:08,287
[SPEAKER_12]: We will follow up on that question about changes, demographics, families of children.

1152
02:26:08,868 --> 02:26:11,070
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just, we can follow up with Micah directly.

1153
02:26:11,711 --> 02:26:17,436
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, and I think just in general, you know, the public comment is not really so much a question and answer.

1154
02:26:18,727 --> 02:26:26,009
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you have specific questions or comments directed to specific counselors, you can always ask them questions or communicate with them directly.

1155
02:26:27,549 --> 02:26:34,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that we can also get in touch with our affordable housing trust fund chair and members anytime.

1156
02:26:34,191 --> 02:26:38,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So feel free to email me and I can follow up with them and get information.

1157
02:26:41,073 --> 02:26:41,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1158
02:26:44,073 --> 02:27:10,045
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, Mr. President, I appreciate your words, but I'm trying to be as diplomatic as possible, and I allow my colleagues to throw negatives my way without using my name, but I'm not going to take it from residents who have the answers that will solve the world's problems every time they approach that podium.

1159
02:27:11,619 --> 02:27:18,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, what you do have is a city council that was elected by the people of Medford that have an opinion that needs to be shared.

1160
02:27:19,547 --> 02:27:35,442
[SPEAKER_15]: So the comments from some of my colleagues that led to the fact that this is shade and shame on me or setting a negative agenda or whatever it may be, the truth of the matter is that's totally opposite of what I stated.

1161
02:27:35,962 --> 02:27:50,292
[SPEAKER_15]: What I stated was I appreciate the hard work and all the positive information that could be shared and then presented so people could understand the full value of that so we could all celebrate it and work together, not divide.

1162
02:27:50,372 --> 02:27:55,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I have my council colleagues sitting behind the rail and talk about with one

1163
02:27:55,936 --> 02:27:56,556
[SPEAKER_15]: part of their mouth.

1164
02:27:56,656 --> 02:28:05,421
[SPEAKER_15]: One side of their mouth, they're going to talk about communication and why that's so important and why we need it and why we need to fund it and why we need to go forward with that process.

1165
02:28:05,681 --> 02:28:12,744
[SPEAKER_15]: But the other side of the mouth say, well, if it's a different focus, if it's a different view from what they feel, shame on you.

1166
02:28:14,125 --> 02:28:15,065
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just not right.

1167
02:28:15,946 --> 02:28:16,646
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not right.

1168
02:28:17,186 --> 02:28:24,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I was elected to be a voice and that's all I shared this evening with a few issues that community members had shared with me.

1169
02:28:25,885 --> 02:28:27,406
[SPEAKER_15]: and I will not stop doing that.

1170
02:28:27,466 --> 02:28:39,335
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to continue to be contentious and we want to go back and forth with this, we can continue these meetings to 11 o'clock at night being negative and going back and forth because listen, if that's what you want, that's what we'll do.

1171
02:28:39,855 --> 02:28:48,382
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, Council President, I appreciate you bringing that full circle and I appreciate you seeing the process of what I was saying to go back

1172
02:28:49,082 --> 02:29:00,710
[SPEAKER_15]: and look at my vote or my process in other areas or where I've been, where I focus on other issues, and bring up numbers of people and surveys.

1173
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:04,772
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do that on both sides if we want to keep doing that in the next two years.

1174
02:29:05,393 --> 02:29:06,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm willing to do that.

1175
02:29:07,954 --> 02:29:10,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we all know where the votes are going to go.

1176
02:29:10,396 --> 02:29:11,376
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be six to one.

1177
02:29:11,416 --> 02:29:12,037
[SPEAKER_15]: We all know that.

1178
02:29:13,207 --> 02:29:16,070
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, one counselor doesn't have the support.

1179
02:29:16,290 --> 02:29:17,171
[SPEAKER_15]: We understand that.

1180
02:29:17,551 --> 02:29:22,836
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to be, I'm going to put a little, little score chart right here with everything that I put forward.

1181
02:29:22,856 --> 02:29:24,417
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say it's going to be contentious.

1182
02:29:24,437 --> 02:29:25,238
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be contentious.

1183
02:29:25,618 --> 02:29:32,485
[SPEAKER_15]: What I said earlier to the, the, the, the leaders of our trust was that that was a very good,

1184
02:29:33,265 --> 02:29:37,869
[SPEAKER_15]: very good, very informative presentation that should be presented to so many people.

1185
02:29:37,889 --> 02:29:48,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate Councilor Zaro sharing where people can say that this is where you can find it, because the truth of the matter is a lot of times when I'm presenting something,

1186
02:29:50,632 --> 02:30:04,161
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that I feel the need that I have to share, but something simple to say, well, we have now the PowerPoint that you can go to to read and look at that where it's supporting our senior citizens, we're so afraid of keeping them in their homes.

1187
02:30:05,022 --> 02:30:19,112
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, just a comment to my colleagues and to the residents, I'm not gonna be silenced because you feel offended because I didn't feel the same way you felt.

1188
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:25,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to speak for what the people that have reached out to me and offer their opinion because I'm their voice.

1189
02:30:26,357 --> 02:30:27,418
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1190
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1191
02:30:29,741 --> 02:30:31,863
[SPEAKER_12]: And Marie will give you one more shot.

1192
02:30:31,883 --> 02:30:33,264
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see if we can hear you, Marie.

1193
02:30:34,025 --> 02:30:34,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address the record.

1194
02:30:34,986 --> 02:30:35,727
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

1195
02:30:36,383 --> 02:30:38,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, it's Marie Izzo from Pilgrim Road.

1196
02:30:38,624 --> 02:30:39,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me now?

1197
02:30:39,445 --> 02:30:41,446
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hear you loud and clear.

1198
02:30:41,726 --> 02:30:42,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1199
02:30:42,146 --> 02:30:48,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I want to thank everyone for all the work that went into this, but I just want to mention a couple of things that really stand out for me.

1200
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:55,033
[SPEAKER_05]: One is after all of the years, at least I've been in this conversation for like, oh, I don't know, at least 10 years here.

1201
02:30:55,533 --> 02:30:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: about affordable housing in Medford and increasing the rate of affordable housing.

1202
02:30:59,475 --> 02:31:08,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when we come to 8% at this point, it's very, I'm just very sad that this is it.

1203
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:09,740
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all we've had.

1204
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:14,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And this includes a bill, you know, sort of things that haven't even been built yet.

1205
02:31:15,603 --> 02:31:19,546
[SPEAKER_05]: including like 250 units that haven't even been built yet.

1206
02:31:20,647 --> 02:31:27,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I mean, the other thing I wanna mention is also that this area mean income is not an accurate indicator.

1207
02:31:27,252 --> 02:31:32,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanna thank Roberta for clarifying that it's based on household income.

1208
02:31:33,096 --> 02:31:36,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And that in fact, it's extreme, it's meaningless.

1209
02:31:36,817 --> 02:31:52,903
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at household income, if you know, four people living together, you know, each making 80 or $90,000 a year minimum, and whatever the number is, and now you have a household income of like $400,000 there and, you know, going into the average, but

1210
02:31:53,580 --> 02:32:12,619
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when we look at really who Medford is versus, you know, sort of matching that data with the needs in the city, I can't imagine how we'll ever be able to do this, particularly when we're having these kinds of conversations, one way or the other.

1211
02:32:12,639 --> 02:32:15,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that it's just a stark

1212
02:32:16,342 --> 02:32:26,455
[SPEAKER_05]: a reality that we have young people moving in with high incomes that can afford either to buy or to rent at higher rates.

1213
02:32:27,156 --> 02:32:33,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're building potentially things that even what's, and I'm going to mention this, what's happening in

1214
02:32:34,245 --> 02:32:45,088
[SPEAKER_05]: down by city hall we're releasing to contractors at very very high levels just to build more housing to attract people to come in when we're not addressing the need within the city.

1215
02:32:45,269 --> 02:32:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really all I want to do and I just want the council to bear in mind

1216
02:32:50,890 --> 02:32:56,813
[SPEAKER_05]: that we really need to match the needs of the city the way that they've shown up.

1217
02:32:56,893 --> 02:33:08,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, again, I'm grateful for looking at this and addressing it accurately, not with these numbers that don't mean anything like this area mean income.

1218
02:33:09,037 --> 02:33:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we were only giving it to people at 80% of that area mean income.

1219
02:33:13,379 --> 02:33:16,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not, those are not the people in need.

1220
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:23,264
[SPEAKER_05]: those people coming in, you know, single people that are making whatever amounts of money.

1221
02:33:24,124 --> 02:33:38,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to keep everyone really, if we can focus on matching the needs to the people and the economic situation where 50% are making less than 50%, but there is never any housing that's going to address 50%.

1222
02:33:39,734 --> 02:33:41,916
[SPEAKER_05]: of that population, period.

1223
02:33:41,936 --> 02:33:48,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you all for spending the time and doing the work, including the council.

1224
02:33:48,721 --> 02:33:49,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

02:33:50,382 --> 02:33:51,063

02:36:09,212 --> 02:36:13,273
[SPEAKER_12]: CPA manager and a representative of Trees Medford will be in attendance to address the council.

1266
02:36:14,934 --> 02:36:16,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Recognized manager DuPont.

1267
02:36:19,355 --> 02:36:21,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And you should be able to start your video if you want.

1268
02:36:25,597 --> 02:36:26,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody.

1269
02:36:26,337 --> 02:36:27,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1270
02:36:27,417 --> 02:36:29,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's with us from Trees Medford, Teresa?

1271
02:36:30,718 --> 02:36:34,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually, I thought it was going to be Amanda Bowen and I thought she was going to be joining online.

1272
02:36:34,599 --> 02:36:35,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see her.

1273
02:36:35,179 --> 02:36:35,760
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right.

1274
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:36,940
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm here.

1275
02:36:37,472 --> 02:36:42,356
[SPEAKER_12]: We're happy to take a donation, but we do want to hear about the great work Trees Medford does to raise the money.

1276
02:36:43,536 --> 02:36:56,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so just as a little bit of background, the CPA hat that I wear is very wide brimmed, so I end up touching quite a few departments, including having some overlap with my colleagues in the forestry department, as well as Trees Medford.

1277
02:36:56,105 --> 02:37:01,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm here tonight to ask for your approval and accepting a cash donation from Trees Medford in the amount of $25,000.

1278
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:08,023
[SPEAKER_08]: This source was from the community fund a couple of previous fiscal cycles ago.

1279
02:37:08,724 --> 02:37:10,765
[SPEAKER_08]: It was forward-funded to Trees MedVernage.

1280
02:37:10,805 --> 02:37:15,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of been sitting in an escrow account awaiting appropriation.

1281
02:37:15,529 --> 02:37:24,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we're here today, to actually get that funding into the Tree Planting Donation Fund, which does exist and is out there, if anybody

1282
02:37:25,473 --> 02:37:28,094
[SPEAKER_08]: have some extra chump change at the end of the year and want to donate it.

1283
02:37:29,275 --> 02:37:39,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But so this is a request to have that funding be accepted and then immediately put back into tree plantings around the city.

1284
02:37:39,298 --> 02:37:43,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to answer any other questions that this body may have.

1285
02:37:46,361 --> 02:37:46,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1286
02:37:46,861 --> 02:37:48,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have, I'll go to Councillor Callahan.

1287
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:51,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1288
02:37:51,111 --> 02:38:06,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a little question about this tree planting donation fund and from other conversations I have had with other people, it is not always assured that donations go toward the thing that they were originally donated for.

1289
02:38:06,724 --> 02:38:07,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that our

1290
02:38:07,845 --> 02:38:19,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we will be upgrading the city's budgeting software and financial software to address that problem specifically, that there just simply aren't enough codes.

1291
02:38:19,658 --> 02:38:29,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm basically just asking like, can we be assured that this funding is in fact going to go toward planting public trees?

1292
02:38:35,185 --> 02:38:35,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1293
02:38:35,925 --> 02:38:39,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to forget to not mute myself again afterwards.

1294
02:38:41,767 --> 02:38:47,268
[SPEAKER_08]: The exact account number and description is specifically for tree planting.

1295
02:38:47,388 --> 02:38:53,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be a red flag for anybody else that's setting up a purchase order if it's not for tree planting.

1296
02:38:53,329 --> 02:39:01,691
[SPEAKER_08]: So rest assured that that funding would go directly into a dedicated account specifically for public donations for tree plantings.

1297
02:39:01,811 --> 02:39:04,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all that would be expended from it.

1298
02:39:07,102 --> 02:39:10,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can assure that there's actually tree plantings happening right now.

1299
02:39:10,944 --> 02:39:18,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So I highly doubt that funding will be sitting around for too long, but I would assure the body that that funding would be used for tree plantings.

1300
02:39:20,770 --> 02:39:29,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine you may not know the answer to this question, but is the budget for tree plantings ever reduced because there is money in this fund?

1301
02:39:31,405 --> 02:39:32,286
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

1302
02:39:33,227 --> 02:39:40,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just nice money to have that's around, but there is an annual budgeted amount for tree plantings that Aggie does a great job of spending down.

1303
02:39:40,651 --> 02:39:49,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just some nice boon money to kind of do a quick increase in this year's tree plantings before the end of the season.

1304
02:39:54,841 --> 02:39:55,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1305
02:39:55,101 --> 02:39:58,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any more questions for Manager DuPont?

1306
02:40:00,282 --> 02:40:01,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1307
02:40:03,804 --> 02:40:07,625
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Seng, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1308
02:40:08,506 --> 02:40:09,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1309
02:40:13,528 --> 02:40:14,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan?

1310
02:40:15,889 --> 02:40:16,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins?

1311
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:16,950
Yes.

1312
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:18,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lazaro?

1313
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:18,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1314
02:40:20,071 --> 02:40:20,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lemming?

1315
02:40:20,671 --> 02:40:20,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1316
02:40:21,892 --> 02:40:22,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1317
02:40:22,892 --> 02:40:23,032
Yes.

1318
02:40:23,753 --> 02:40:24,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Seng?

1319
02:40:24,353 --> 02:40:24,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1320
02:40:25,453 --> 02:40:26,114
[SPEAKER_14]: President Pierce?

1321
02:40:26,414 --> 02:40:26,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1322
02:40:26,654 --> 02:40:27,754
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the affirmative, none the negative.

1323
02:40:27,774 --> 02:40:28,455
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion passes.

1324
02:40:30,684 --> 02:40:31,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Teresa.

1325
02:40:31,685 --> 02:40:36,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I think you're here for the next one too.

1326
02:40:36,427 --> 02:40:37,988
[SPEAKER_12]: 25184 submitted by Mayor Brianna Leo Kern.

1327
02:40:39,488 --> 02:40:42,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Appropriation request, Community Preservation Committee.

1328
02:40:42,810 --> 02:40:58,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Dear President Behrs and city councilors, on behalf of the CPC, I respect the request and recommend your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the CPC requesting the appropriation of 55,000 from the CPA Historic Preservation Reserve to the Shiloh Baptist Church of Medford to fund their ongoing ADA improvement project

1329
02:40:59,467 --> 02:41:06,748
[SPEAKER_12]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund, CPC recommendation letter attached incorporated, CPA manager DuPont will be in attendance to address the council.

1330
02:41:06,828 --> 02:41:09,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lingo-Kern, Mayor.

1331
02:41:10,189 --> 02:41:10,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Teresa.

1332
02:41:11,629 --> 02:41:12,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello again.

1333
02:41:12,689 --> 02:41:23,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I'm here before you tonight to support the request of the CPC to fund the amount of $55,000, the Shiloh Baptist ADA Improvements Project.

1334
02:41:23,051 --> 02:41:28,092
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a project that this council has seen before, but just as an update to where this project stands now.

1335
02:41:28,777 --> 02:41:33,400
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at a good 75 completion right now, which is excellent.

1336
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:44,087
[SPEAKER_08]: They're slated for a early spring time opening for the childcare facility that will be in their basement, which is a lot of what this ADA improvements are slated for.

1337
02:41:44,967 --> 02:41:57,055
[SPEAKER_08]: However, as I think everybody's finding, budgets are a little tight right now, and they're just coming up against some change orders and need a little bit of additional contingency funding to finish this project.

1338
02:41:58,114 --> 02:42:01,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is why we're here before you tonight and asking for your support.

1339
02:42:02,236 --> 02:42:10,340
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could, I know it's been a long meeting, but I just want to highlight a couple of great things that the Shiloh Baptist Church has done in partnership with the Sanctuary Church.

1340
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:13,201
[SPEAKER_08]: They've actually been running a weekly produce food pantry.

1341
02:42:13,221 --> 02:42:22,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, you know, it ended for the season a couple of weeks ago, but I really do want to champion their continued efforts to really be a meaningful partner to the West Medford community.

1342
02:42:23,355 --> 02:42:27,836
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also pursuing national registry designation for the church.

1343
02:42:28,157 --> 02:42:39,700
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of backstory, it's a very prominent church in West Medford, and one of the two brown shingle buildings that are church Baptist churches that are about two blocks away from each other.

1344
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:48,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So just as a quick update, we are pursuing again, national registry designation for this building, which would allow and open up further grant opportunities.

1345
02:42:48,543 --> 02:42:51,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The building still needs another million, million plus in

1346
02:42:52,592 --> 02:42:53,414
[SPEAKER_08]: restoration work.

1347
02:42:54,797 --> 02:42:59,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to give that little update because this is a project that the council has seen multiple times.

1348
02:42:59,988 --> 02:43:03,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to address any other further questions and ask for your support.

1349
02:43:05,475 --> 02:43:06,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Manager DuPont.

1350
02:43:06,956 --> 02:43:08,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli, then Councillor Lazzaro.

1351
02:43:09,016 --> 02:43:09,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1352
02:43:09,656 --> 02:43:10,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1353
02:43:10,717 --> 02:43:12,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. DuPont, thank you so much.

1354
02:43:12,097 --> 02:43:27,723
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that I've asked this question a few times, and to bring it up again, because for some reason it's the same question, but again, the community preservation funds made for supporting our historical sites, and we know how historical and how important our shallow baptist

1355
02:43:28,283 --> 02:43:29,545
[SPEAKER_15]: churches, and our community.

1356
02:43:30,966 --> 02:43:38,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the approval of this process is to support its historical integrity, correct?

1357
02:43:39,195 --> 02:43:47,164
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is why we are allowed to share our taxpayers' funds for a project like this, because I would support it a thousand percent.

1358
02:43:48,155 --> 02:43:55,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and I will say Councillor Scarfelli, I always appreciate that you want to clarify for the public just to make sure that this is a transparent process.

1359
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:57,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate your comments here.

1360
02:43:57,542 --> 02:44:04,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ADA improvement to a historical community asset is an eligible expense under CPA.

1361
02:44:04,147 --> 02:44:09,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to explain that a little bit, it's just so that it continues to be a modernly used historical asset.

1362
02:44:10,451 --> 02:44:12,993
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, you need to have ADA accessibility.

1363
02:44:14,697 --> 02:44:29,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, again, like I said, I think that that's important to make sure that we eliminate any of those negative questions that are out there and I appreciate everything you do and this is something that I would move approval when it is time, Mr. President.

1364
02:44:29,904 --> 02:44:30,405
[SPEAKER_15]: So, thank you.

1365
02:44:31,285 --> 02:44:32,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1366
02:44:32,246 --> 02:44:33,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lazaro.

1367
02:44:34,987 --> 02:44:35,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1368
02:44:35,907 --> 02:44:42,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a couple of questions about the proposed childcare facility

1369
02:44:43,565 --> 02:44:47,048
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe opening as part of this project.

1370
02:44:47,869 --> 02:44:48,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very exciting.

1371
02:44:48,730 --> 02:44:54,134
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a real lack of accessible child care in Medford.

1372
02:44:54,234 --> 02:44:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know there are a lot of people trying to address that issue.

1373
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:06,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me what ages of kids would be served by this project.

1374
02:45:07,434 --> 02:45:13,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say for certain, but I believe it is like a five to 12 age bracket, perhaps even younger.

1375
02:45:13,135 --> 02:45:14,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be five to eight.

1376
02:45:16,476 --> 02:45:25,477
[SPEAKER_08]: It has been a while since I've revisited that aspect of this project, been really more focusing on the building itself, but I can certainly find that out and would be happy to share that with this council.

1377
02:45:26,738 --> 02:45:32,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a Bonsai childcare, which does already have a facility in Medford.

1378
02:45:32,299 --> 02:45:34,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So this will be an expansion.

1379
02:45:35,035 --> 02:45:45,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody is familiar with Bonsai childcare, I personally am not, I don't have children, but I can certainly find that out and follow up with this group.

1380
02:45:45,581 --> 02:45:51,324
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe it is in the five to eight or maybe even younger to eight years old.

1381
02:45:52,585 --> 02:45:55,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I appreciate all of the

1382
02:45:56,533 --> 02:46:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: work that Shiloh Baptist Church is doing to contribute to the holistic service of the needs of our residents in Medford.

1383
02:46:06,618 --> 02:46:15,762
[SPEAKER_07]: After school care for our elementary age students is something that we've been facing a lot of challenges in Medford lately.

1384
02:46:15,782 --> 02:46:26,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's a lot of work being done and we're addressing a lot of the problems but I'm sure this is one of the ways I'm not on school committee so I can't speak directly.

1385
02:46:26,437 --> 02:46:32,280
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do have kids who are in elementary school and had to get, had to start a new program this year.

1386
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:36,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And there, there was just for a long time a gap for third graders.

1387
02:46:37,663 --> 02:46:48,828
[SPEAKER_07]: One program would end in second grade and another program, these are private programs, so not even the school programs, but the next program didn't do third grade, started in fourth grade.

1388
02:46:49,588 --> 02:46:52,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And there just wasn't, you know, there wasn't enough for third graders.

1389
02:46:54,171 --> 02:46:58,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, it sounds awesome.

1390
02:46:58,053 --> 02:46:59,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that it's happening.

1391
02:46:59,214 --> 02:47:00,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to support this.

1392
02:47:00,915 --> 02:47:08,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to support it anyway just for the historic preservation of the building and for the service that it provides to the neighborhood.

1393
02:47:08,259 --> 02:47:17,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I love it when something can both serve the church community and also be serving the wider community as well.

1394
02:47:17,465 --> 02:47:21,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a really great example of cohesion and

1395
02:47:22,043 --> 02:47:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody helping each other out in a real community.

1396
02:47:26,106 --> 02:47:28,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thank you for bringing this forward and for your work.

1397
02:47:29,288 --> 02:47:29,609
Thank you.

1398
02:47:31,050 --> 02:47:32,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

1399
02:47:32,771 --> 02:47:35,333
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_12]: The motion passes.

1420
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:21,612
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1421
02:48:22,692 --> 02:48:24,414

1423
02:48:30,162 --> 02:48:31,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and Collins seconded.

1424
02:48:32,385 --> 02:48:33,025
