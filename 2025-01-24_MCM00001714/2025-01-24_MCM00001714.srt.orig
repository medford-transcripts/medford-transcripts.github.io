1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be advised, and I'm going to leave the meeting because Jenny can't join.

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:15,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So please be advised that on Thursday, January 23, 2025, at 6.30 p.m., there will be an MSBA communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting held through remote participation and via Zoom.

3
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:25,312
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda is roll call, finalize community survey to collect input on FAQs and other features for the website, discuss MHS video project and develop a plan of action.

4
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:26,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Recording in progress.

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:27,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a German.

6
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will start with the roll call.

7
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa Desmond?

8
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:35,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

9
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria Dorsey?

10
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke Prisner?

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina C?

13
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Will, do we usually call you on the roll call?

14
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:48,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

15
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:53,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got formally inducted at a school committee meeting in the fall, so.

16
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:53,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so Will Papaselli?

18
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:55,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

19
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,363
[SPEAKER_03]: and Nicole Murrell, present.

20
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think I see we have Larry and we have Peter on as well.

21
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:11,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first item on the agenda is to finalize the community survey to collect input on FAQs and other features on the website.

22
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something you have to share, Will?

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let me figure out what screen to share.

24
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:24,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's this one.

25
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:36,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Can y'all see this?

26
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

27
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:50,838
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I went to a few of the other website, the other schools that were building or in the process of building a new building.

28
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at Lexington.

29
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at Stoneham.

30
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at Waltham.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are probably a little more advanced in the process than we are at this stage.

32
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,882
[SPEAKER_06]: But I kind of broke it down.

33
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think these were kind of the big,

34
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:18,052
[SPEAKER_06]: The big ones that need answering and throughout this, I'll be happy to either add more or take feedback or think about some things that we could possibly add to this.

35
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:22,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are kind of the big starting points.

36
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,902
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of probably the big, those, those large key questions.

37
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:31,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

38
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um.

39
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:39,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Do folks want to, can you share a link to that we could look at so we can just do it on our own?

40
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, anyone with link?

41
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:50,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I will add it in a chat.

42
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll just keep going through it.

43
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:01,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so I think the next thing is kind of, I guess the next step is the who.

44
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:13,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are some questions that we don't have answers to today, obviously, with the OPM, the construction manager, designer, and what those people who will be joining us in stage two look like.

45
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also, so I kind of broke it down as the big picture questions.

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,462
[SPEAKER_06]: the questions for stage two, and then kind of the work that we've already done so far, which is in stage one.

47
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:39,386
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened, what documents have we already done, who was part of this, which is obviously the committee that was formed earlier in the spring, and then kind of the background of our history with the MSBA process.

48
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then in terms of like,

49
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:52,445
[SPEAKER_06]: wherever the new high school, like what will happen and all the kind of logistical questions I know that we don't have the answers to right now.

50
00:03:54,286 --> 00:04:02,014
[SPEAKER_06]: My personal opinion was I didn't think it'd be appropriate slash worth listening them because we don't have the answers to those questions.

51
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:06,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy to have any feedback.

52
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We should add something, take something out, but yeah.

53
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:32,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wonder if it is, at least for the where will the new high school be, I wonder if it's worth including and just saying, you know, this is, you know, whatever the answer is, as far as this is something that's still under consideration, just because I just wonder if people don't see the question, they'll just like assume it's missed, and they're just gonna, you know, email and ask and we're gonna email back anyway.

54
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:37,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So just like kind of letting people know it's still TBD, but we're aware that it's a big question.

55
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:42,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the case with a lot of the questions that you have down there.

56
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,366
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to ask, where's my kid going to go to school?

57
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately, someone's going to say, where's my rising freshman school next year?

58
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:58,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have questions that maybe there's a section that's questions still to be answered or something like that.

59
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:58,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

60
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already hearing people say, I heard it's going to be built.

61
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are already guessing.

62
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing the Anheuser-Busch plant.

63
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,530
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's the way it goes.

64
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:21,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

65
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:26,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard that one yet, but that's a, yeah, any open parcel of land, I'm sure.

66
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Conjecture.

67
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So Marissa, just going back to what you said, these are kind of some of that I had listed that I think kind of fall under that realm.

68
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I just bump those up?

69
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:43,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not necessarily all of them, like what design elements will be included and factored into the project.

70
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:52,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that's something like that's, I mean, it's not specific, but it is pretty specific, but like, oh, a new high school is being built.

71
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,374
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids in high school, what's going to happen to them?

72
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:54,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

73
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,983
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing that someone's going to want to know.

74
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:02,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is totally reasonable that we don't have the answer, but.

75
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

76
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:06,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

77
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:30,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So my understanding was that part of the feasibility study was to take a look at the various sites that have been proposed and you know obviously the existing site is one.

78
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:35,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there had been a question about whether that could move down below the

79
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:43,389
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jewish synagogue and incorporate that if that was a possibility.

80
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's been some discussion of

81
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:54,639
[SPEAKER_00]: the park down there at the end of Playstead, and then the bush, or the, yeah, the bud.

82
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was just kind of out there, because it's such a nice place, and it's essentially relocated.

83
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:15,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know quite if any work has been done on any of those sites, but I think somebody has them in their notes, I think, that those were things to possibly investigate, as well as the existing site up on the fields and stuff.

84
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:22,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I've no idea where it's at, but those are things I've heard.

85
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:46,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I guess, Larry, in terms of what we're doing here, piggybacking off what you said, I think maybe just having that key question like Marissa said, but also maybe listing some of the sites that we've at least explored without committing ourselves to locking those spots down in stone.

86
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:58,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, not to split hairs, but I do wonder if listing any sites, I mean, I think just, I think maybe listing- It might be premature.

87
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:07,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, criteria for what's under consideration in a site, but I think listing anything specific just kind of, people look at stuff really quick and then run with it, so.

88
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of the feasibility study, because I don't have a clue.

89
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:20,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be a good idea just to say, including the current location, because some people may- Sure.

90
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's really important, Maria, good point.

91
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:26,296
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

92
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:38,482
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should say- I think that could just go into that, do you share questions to be answered?

93
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,281
[SPEAKER_01]: We could list it there could be.

94
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:41,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

95
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:52,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not entirely sure what the format would be, but, like, it could be, like, under study, you know, under consideration at the moment.

96
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,618
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know once the feasibility study gets underway.

97
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:14,815
[SPEAKER_06]: or something like that, and we can either list specific places, including the new high school, or we can kind of just list general areas of space that are open.

98
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:21,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I would say, you know, a number of locations are under consideration, including the current site.

99
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be worth just another questions to be answered.

100
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:43,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there's just like a subtext underneath that, that's like, just basically says like the, the questions below are, you know, identifying answers to the questions below are part of this process.

101
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:47,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not like we're behind by not having answers to these questions.

102
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that has to be figured out along the way.

103
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is there.

104
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:21,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll just we'll just start kind of with the, are these good for the kind of the four main sections the.

105
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:33,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess three because we've technically not in stage two yet but just bringing it down as big stuff feasibility is stage one and then questions to be answered.

106
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:46,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would just make sure in the project basics it references, and maybe it's in the project timeline, it just references the stages so that someone understands what, like, you know, why we're saying stage one and stage two below.

107
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So just making sure that that's outlined elsewhere.

108
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:55,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe what does the MSBA process?

109
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:58,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that?

110
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:58,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

111
00:10:58,967 --> 00:10:59,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

112
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:11,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there, I guess now we'll just go section by section just so we cover our bases.

113
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:14,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else worth adding in this basic section?

114
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:20,756
[SPEAKER_00]: What did Jenny say?

115
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:25,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think some of this stuff has been discussed previously and some of it may be in the notes.

116
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:26,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

117
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I've toured several high schools.

118
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:30,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

119
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Maria, you did one of them.

120
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:46,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took a ton of notes, but we've never, you know, I don't, I think it's prematurity to the design stage, like, very specifically until we have the site and stuff.

121
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,025
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, some of this stuff has been discussed previously.

122
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find it in the record already.

123
00:11:54,612 --> 00:12:14,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess I'm more concerned about the questions themselves rather than necessarily the answers at tonight, and then we can kind of collaborate what the answers will look like, which has been discussed throughout these meetings.

124
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:22,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm kind of stuck on the question, will the new Medford High School offer CTE programming?

125
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:25,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's almost making it sound like it hasn't been offering it.

126
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:45,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe it should say, will continue to be, or that it's turned moving to a comprehensive school with both the CTE and high school together, or I'm just stuck on the wording there.

127
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: for the new Bedford High School?

128
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that- The answer to that, I believe, is absolutely yes.

129
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be- Alongside- Approved.

130
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Or to be part of the high school complex, maybe?

131
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:23,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could just at the end, after continue to offer CTE programming alongside, you know, the traditional.

132
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

133
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, alongside the traditional.

134
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:35,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's the right word, but yeah, high school curriculum or the yeah.

135
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:40,910
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

136
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:55,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I can play around with that, but I think the genesis of making sure that we'll see TB offered, but also alongside what we're already teaching many of our students.

137
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,729
Yeah.

138
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, is there anything else that sticks out here, or should we jump on to down below?

139
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take that where will the high school be built out of this section.

140
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,440
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking this out and moving it down.

141
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you already moved it down there, but.

142
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:18,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It is listed to it.

143
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,106
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

144
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:25,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it makes sense to have it below because like in this section, we're going to have like actual answers.

145
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:25,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

146
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So having it in the section where it's just like, okay.

147
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:40,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're skipping stage two because we were not there quite yet.

148
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:41,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully soon.

149
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:55,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I guess in terms of stage one, this is where we can keep some of those documents that we already worked on, remind people of who was involved in this stage.

150
00:14:56,672 --> 00:15:04,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also just a little historical backdrop of kind of when and how.

151
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wonder if the first question, just to get a bit more like powerful language, just say what was accomplished in this step, maybe rather than like what happened in this step.

152
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:58,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe was this the first time we went through instead of we, you could say like the Medford school committee or Medford high school building committee or something like that.

153
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this, was this the first time.

154
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:13,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make more sense?

155
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:15,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

156
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and now I wasn't here for those first steps of the feasibility study.

157
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,995
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there anything else that sticks out as part of that process?

158
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think this maybe is answered.

159
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of addressed above, but I don't know if.

160
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:49,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are costs estimates revealed as part of the feasibility study?

161
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:56,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's like getting into the weeds, but I feel like if I saw feasibility study, I'd be like, oh, maybe they have, you know, dollar signs they got from the feasibility study.

162
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:05,396
[SPEAKER_06]: For cost-free.

163
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense or should that be?

164
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:37,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes sense as a non-construction manager, like a non-expert in this space.

165
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:48,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I think here we can also say the city provided us money to go into a feasibility study as well.

166
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Make that clear here.

167
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:51,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good point.

168
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:53,696
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

169
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, do you guys have any questions that I can help with?

170
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of this stuff already discussed and I don't think I have a role to discuss it further.

171
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what else I can contribute tonight.

172
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:16,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you got a reason, I think I'm gonna, that's it.

173
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,426
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any reason to stay, I'm happy to do that.

174
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:23,307
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't quite understand what's going on here.

175
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:28,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we're mostly in the question asking part of the communications process.

176
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:28,807
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

177
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys got a good handle on that.

178
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:33,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see you next time.

179
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

180
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:35,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

181
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good evening, all.

182
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:37,853
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

183
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:52,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think these are the big questions that people may still have about the project that we don't have answers yet to.

184
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there's only three listed.

185
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there more to consider?

186
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:03,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at the ones that were down below again.

187
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:07,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

188
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if.

189
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:19,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also had some of these.

190
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:27,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I think that Kids Corner and yeah, I think Kids Corner, Curtis Tufts are important.

191
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I agree.

192
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:49,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I don't know exactly what the answer for the, you know, how is this project or how will this project be funded?

193
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume that's going to include the, like a reference to a debt exclusion or a potential debt exclusion.

194
00:19:55,655 --> 00:20:06,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder if then in the questions to be answered, it's, you know, when can we expect, you know, when can voters expect to see something related to this project on the ballot?

195
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:27,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm like, there's so many questions, I'm forgetting what I read up above.

196
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,667
[SPEAKER_01]: But was there one, when will the project be finished?

197
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that's another thing that we don't know.

198
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:34,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

199
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a general project timeline question.

200
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I had that same thought, too.

201
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:47,156
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still like, I mean, this is where I'm meeting a million meetings ago, I was saying it might be nice to kind of create like a graphic

202
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:55,340
[SPEAKER_01]: timeline as opposed to a timeline that has actual dates on it, to be able to just be like, here's where we are in the process.

203
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:02,283
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no idea how long this process is, but we're X percentage of the way through.

204
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And the MSBA has some really good graphics about what the timeline looks like.

205
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:16,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it'd be kind of easy to just take what they have, apply it to us, and then even just stick that picture as the answers.

206
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:22,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I like that idea, Marissa.

207
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I can definitely help if we want to create any visuals as well.

208
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:29,469
[SPEAKER_01]: That's.

209
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,750
[SPEAKER_06]: My house.

210
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:31,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

211
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:39,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I think these questions we, um.

212
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we need to answer tonight.

213
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:47,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Dave, a lot of them have already been answered kind of in the public meetings that we've had.

214
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:53,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can either talk to Jenny or just go back to those meetings and pull some of the answers to them.

215
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: But in terms of what we're ready to publish and just because I know the questions that we have, many of the community members will have them as well.

216
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:04,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

217
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's anything else you think is worth discussing for this, the link for it is in the chat.

218
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:21,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's easier to see it on that end.

219
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll have access to this, right?

220
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we, are we commenters?

221
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:26,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're full editors.

222
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:27,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

223
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:28,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can take the comment, but yeah.

224
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:28,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

225
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume this is like kind of a living document.

226
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:42,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we wanna vote out something tonight so that we can get something up, but like anytime we meet, we can say, oh, I think we should add this, right?

227
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:43,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.

228
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:51,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can also, after the meeting ends, make it look a little more organized than these letters.

229
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:57,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nicole, I guess in terms of voting, what is there to,

230
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,701
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of make sure it gets voted on tonight for this.

231
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just like us like voting to approve this to, I assume the next step on your end is just to get it on the website.

232
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:13,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it would just be to vote to approve as is would be my thought.

233
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

234
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:22,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So do we have any further edits or do we feel comfortable having a motion to approve?

235
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:26,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm comfortable having a motion, yeah.

236
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,622
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

237
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:28,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get a motion?

238
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the document.

239
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:38,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the document by Maria, seconded by... Seconded.

240
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're non-voting as far as I know, so I think I can only get a vote from... Seconded.

241
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Marissa.

242
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:48,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

243
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:48,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

244
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

245
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

246
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose.

247
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:53,532
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

248
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,113
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

249
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:02,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing we have is, um, finalizing the community survey as well.

250
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:10,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Um Marie, I'll I have I can put it up on my screen if you want to

251
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:31,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So this document is obviously directed towards the faculty and staff of the high school.

252
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:37,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we say community, I'm just limiting that community to the stakeholders here.

253
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:51,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spoke with a couple of the teachers before I worked on this, and one of them said, you need to make sure you answer three questions.

254
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,189
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we keeping?

255
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:52,969
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?

256
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:53,790
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you need?

257
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So those questions, that actually directed how I asked the questions, and Will certainly cleaned it up, too, and made it

258
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:13,012
[SPEAKER_02]: better by adding the last question as well, because people always want to know, is this going to be in confidence?

259
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:18,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to, is my name going to be attached to this when I answer?

260
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty direct.

261
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:23,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It's short, which is what we wanted.

262
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:42,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was discussed at the last meeting that we just wanted a few questions to put it out there to staff and faculty and get them thinking about the process, get them invested in the process, and then let them start to guide us with some of their needs.

263
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they'll think of some things that we haven't come up with.

264
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I will share this out with everyone after.

265
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:59,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Google Forms is really hard with sharing permissions these days, so I just want to make sure it gets into my hands.

266
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:03,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So piggybacking off of what Maria said,

267
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:11,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plan is to send this out to MHS staff members, kind of solicit their responses.

268
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:23,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the bottom, because they're kind of thinking about it, if they're interested in speaking on camera to the students, we met with Mr. Hester, who runs our film and TV production CTE program.

269
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:31,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got some students who are interested in helping us make a video just kind of outlining why we need a new high school.

270
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:33,672
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought that,

271
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:46,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of formed it sounded as a narrative came from the student came from the mostly teachers, but also some of the students who fortunately won't be able to use the high school just because of the project timeline.

272
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:50,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll kind of drive the narrative and the importance of why we need this building.

273
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, effectively.

274
00:26:54,981 --> 00:27:03,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean also talked about how much more effective it is to ask fewer questions rather than more questions.

275
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that guided this forum as well.

276
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's prepared to start as soon as we put this out.

277
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:22,120
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very excited about being involved with the project and he even wanted to bring students to our meeting with Will.

278
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're ready to go and they're ready to jump on it.

279
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,347
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very excited about it.

280
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:32,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

281
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:36,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this looks good to me, I think, especially when you put the emphasis on just keeping it shorter.

282
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:43,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if just question three, it just says, what are the components of the school that we need to keep?

283
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:48,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we need to be clear that it's physical components or like,

284
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: or space components or something, because I could just imagine someone writing a long thing about programming we need to keep.

285
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:56,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that is an answer.

286
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.

287
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:01,296
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if we're just looking for physical space responses.

288
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:08,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that kind of gets addressed in the next question as far as limits, talking classroom shops.

289
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that needs to be reworded, that

290
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but that's a good point.

291
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:23,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, maybe someone does answer just programmatically, but that's still helpful information because you say, okay, they really care about this program and we need to find space for it.

292
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even if we just say what would need what that we need to keep thinking in terms of you and your students, maybe putting it that way.

293
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:37,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think just getting your.

294
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:53,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could be up for that, but I think getting your background information too, like I think that's, I understand it better now, like, you know, having these, I understand that the second question is like a little bit more about space and if people answer programmatically in the first question, then that still informs space.

295
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:56,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just change the order.

296
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:08,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the want question is like really physical spaces and that like might get people more in the mindset of like answering about space

297
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:13,089
[SPEAKER_01]: within the building as opposed to concepts.

298
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:14,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.

299
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.

300
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:24,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's, what do you want to see in the new high school?

301
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:27,999
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to keep from the old high school?

302
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what do we need in the new?

303
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:33,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.

304
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:34,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

305
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in terms of the video itself,

306
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:55,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean said, Mr. Sean Hester said that, depending on how many people respond, the video itself is only going to be like three to five minutes, keeping it short, because our 2025 attention spans are not always the highest these days.

307
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:08,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So keeping it short, and if we get a lot of great answers, he said his students are willing to kind of cut up some different variations that will still serve the same purpose.

308
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:14,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for my understanding, this is the same video that's on the agenda.

309
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,213
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the video we were going to talk about anyways later tonight.

310
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know there was an archive video we talked about a long time ago, just making sure this is the video that we had planned to talk about tonight.

311
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

312
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:31,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the first leg of it, right?

313
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it will be an ongoing video series, I guess.

314
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my understanding anyway.

315
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:39,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

316
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I'm just like, yeah, I'm just making sure it's not, not making sure, I'm just making sure I'm talking about the right things.

317
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:52,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember their talk of like old library footage, like several meetings back and just making sure I'm talking about the same video as everyone else.

318
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:57,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

319
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,489
[SPEAKER_03]: This survey looks good to me.

320
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:03,632
[SPEAKER_03]: If folks have any other edits or thoughts.

321
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,691
[SPEAKER_01]: this video will be later shared as part of the, I think just shared later.

322
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:21,672
[SPEAKER_06]: This video will be shared like publicly later?

323
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make it clear that like, if you're going to go on camera, like we're going to broadcast what you said.

324
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:33,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I just think later shared is a little clunky, just shared later.

325
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:36,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even just shared as a part of community outreach.

326
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:40,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's better.

327
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:41,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

328
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a motion to approve the survey as is.

329
00:31:55,922 --> 00:32:00,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve the survey motion to approve the survey from Marissa seconded by.

330
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second it, Maria, and then we'll vote.

331
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Marissa, on the motion to approve the survey?

332
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:10,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

333
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one yes.

334
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And Maria, on the motion to approve the survey?

335
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:16,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

336
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:17,914
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself?

337
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:18,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

338
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:19,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's three in the affirmative.

339
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:20,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

340
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also just have on the agenda the video itself.

341
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anything else you want to share about it, Maria?

342
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:37,116
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, our conversation with Sean was pretty directed towards just this piece.

343
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:44,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think as we move along, they'll see where we go according to our process.

344
00:32:48,214 --> 00:33:05,177
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got such a good handle on how this would be viewed to the public, what needs to be done, how to make it so that everybody will be able to, I guess, enjoy it and get something out of it by keeping things short.

345
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:09,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just will be ongoing.

346
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:14,779
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, I don't think there's really any plan other than that it will continue.

347
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:16,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

348
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:17,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

349
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like the action plan where it stands now is basically get the survey out and start to collect this and then hand it off to the students.

350
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as they edit together, go from there as it comes together.

351
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

352
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

353
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: As it is what you when you're dealing with students, that's pretty much the way it has to be anyway.

354
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So right.

355
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

356
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:39,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

357
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:45,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know if we had to take any, I don't feel like we don't have to take any official action on that outside of we approve the survey, which includes the question.

358
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:47,647
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's done.

359
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:49,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So that covers our agenda.

360
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless folks have anything else.

361
00:33:53,492 --> 00:34:09,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a question, and this is only because I was listening to some information about some of the other building projects, and one of the high schools costs about $250 million.

362
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:13,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the range that we're considering?

363
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

364
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:18,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we haven't talked any money, but is that where we're at?

365
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're looking at?

366
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:23,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any idea?

367
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:26,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was kind of floored at that.

368
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:38,345
[SPEAKER_01]: From my personal architecture background, that's like an expensive school, but it is not like an order of magnitude off.

369
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:39,927
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be up there.

370
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just and that'll be like total project costs.

371
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:58,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So not like the not only just the building that'll include all of the fees for the design team, the fees for the construction team, all of the equipment that goes to fitting out the building and everything like that.

372
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything's finished landscaping and all of that.

373
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:04,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

374
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:09,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just briefly looked up my alma mater, which is in full reverse.

375
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a bells and whistles kind of place.

376
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:15,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It is significantly larger than Medford High, and it was $263 million.

377
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think at this point, it's definitely in that world.

378
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

379
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:23,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's an incredible amount.

380
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

381
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:38,187
[SPEAKER_02]: staggering, especially, you know, I was somewhat involved in the K-8 school building, and the whole project, I think, was less than that.

382
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:48,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that construction costs have really, really risen in the post-COVID era, like things have gone way, way, way up.

383
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I remember, I can't remember how much it costs.

384
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look it up.

385
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:58,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Newton North and like the big story about it being like the most expensive high school ever.

386
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:01,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I feel like everything costs that much.

387
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:03,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

388
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:04,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

389
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think Otis will have, will be kind of surprised when I saw, when it's revealed, but.

390
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:18,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, but I think that's why part of the reason or debt exclusions are over 30 years.

391
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:26,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So divided by X number of people over 30 years and it's a little less shocking, but it is, yeah, it's not an insignificant amount by any means.

392
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:34,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, all right, thanks everyone for working so hard and for a very timely meeting.

393
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need a motion to adjourn.

394
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:39,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn.

395
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,023
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Maria to adjourn, seconded by... Seconded.

396
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Marissa.

397
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I will call the vote on the motion to adjourn.

398
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:49,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa?

399
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

400
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:52,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria?

401
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:52,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

402
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:53,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself?

403
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

404
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's three in the affirmative.

405
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:56,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting is adjourned.
