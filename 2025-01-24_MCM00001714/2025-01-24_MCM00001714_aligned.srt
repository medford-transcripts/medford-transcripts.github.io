1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:04,275
Please be advised, and I'm going to leave the meeting because Jenny can't join.

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:15,564
So please be advised that on Thursday, January 23, 2025, at 6.30 p.m., there will be an MSBA communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting held through remote participation and via Zoom.

3
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:25,312
The agenda is roll call, finalize community survey to collect input on FAQs and other features for the website, discuss MHS video project and develop a plan of action.

4
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:26,253
Recording in progress.

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:27,773
And then a German.

6
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,195
So I will start with the roll call.

7
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:32,055
Marissa Desmond?

8
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:35,097
Here.

9
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,218
Maria Dorsey?

10
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,319
Hey.

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,059
Luke Prisner?

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,861
Tina C?

13
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,862
Will, do we usually call you on the roll call?

14
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:48,923
I can't remember.

15
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:53,405
Yeah, I got formally inducted at a school committee meeting in the fall, so.

16
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:53,825
Okay, perfect.

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,986
All right, so Will Papaselli?

18
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:55,546
Here.

19
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,363
and Nicole Murrell, present.

20
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:02,686
And then I think I see we have Larry and we have Peter on as well.

21
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:11,372
So the first item on the agenda is to finalize the community survey to collect input on FAQs and other features on the website.

22
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,754
Is that something you have to share, Will?

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,477
Yes, let me figure out what screen to share.

24
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:24,381
I think it's this one.

25
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:36,012
Can y'all see this?

26
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:36,333
Yes.

27
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:50,838
OK, so I went to a few of the other website, the other schools that were building or in the process of building a new building.

28
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,879
I looked at Lexington.

29
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,719
I looked at Stoneham.

30
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,260
I looked at Waltham.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,661
Some of them are probably a little more advanced in the process than we are at this stage.

32
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,882
But I kind of broke it down.

33
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,563
So I think these were kind of the big,

34
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:18,052
The big ones that need answering and throughout this, I'll be happy to either add more or take feedback or think about some things that we could possibly add to this.

35
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:22,056
But these are kind of the big starting points.

36
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,902
In terms of probably the big, those, those large key questions.

37
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:31,145
Thanks.

38
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,226
Well, um.

39
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:39,243
Do folks want to, can you share a link to that we could look at so we can just do it on our own?

40
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,627
I will, anyone with link?

41
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:50,136
And then I will add it in a chat.

42
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,056
And then I'll just keep going through it.

43
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:01,798
And then so I think the next thing is kind of, I guess the next step is the who.

44
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:13,461
So these are some questions that we don't have answers to today, obviously, with the OPM, the construction manager, designer, and what those people who will be joining us in stage two look like.

45
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,663
And then I also, so I kind of broke it down as the big picture questions.

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,462
the questions for stage two, and then kind of the work that we've already done so far, which is in stage one.

47
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:39,386
What happened, what documents have we already done, who was part of this, which is obviously the committee that was formed earlier in the spring, and then kind of the background of our history with the MSBA process.

48
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,968
So, and then in terms of like,

49
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:52,445
wherever the new high school, like what will happen and all the kind of logistical questions I know that we don't have the answers to right now.

50
00:03:54,286 --> 00:04:02,014
My personal opinion was I didn't think it'd be appropriate slash worth listening them because we don't have the answers to those questions.

51
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:06,198
So I'm happy to have any feedback.

52
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,641
We should add something, take something out, but yeah.

53
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:32,715
I do wonder if it is, at least for the where will the new high school be, I wonder if it's worth including and just saying, you know, this is, you know, whatever the answer is, as far as this is something that's still under consideration, just because I just wonder if people don't see the question, they'll just like assume it's missed, and they're just gonna, you know, email and ask and we're gonna email back anyway.

54
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:37,697
So just like kind of letting people know it's still TBD, but we're aware that it's a big question.

55
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:42,105
I think that's probably the case with a lot of the questions that you have down there.

56
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,366
People are going to ask, where's my kid going to go to school?

57
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,288
Immediately, someone's going to say, where's my rising freshman school next year?

58
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:58,412
And you just have questions that maybe there's a section that's questions still to be answered or something like that.

59
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:58,913
Yeah.

60
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,203
I'm already hearing people say, I heard it's going to be built.

61
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,785
And people are already guessing.

62
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,167
I'm hearing the Anheuser-Busch plant.

63
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,530
But anyway, that's the way it goes.

64
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:21,311
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:26,274
I have not heard that one yet, but that's a, yeah, any open parcel of land, I'm sure.

66
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,776
Conjecture.

67
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,163
So Marissa, just going back to what you said, these are kind of some of that I had listed that I think kind of fall under that realm.

68
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,304
Should I just bump those up?

69
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:43,927
I mean, not necessarily all of them, like what design elements will be included and factored into the project.

70
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:52,012
Like, I think that's something like that's, I mean, it's not specific, but it is pretty specific, but like, oh, a new high school is being built.

71
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,374
My kids in high school, what's going to happen to them?

72
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:54,714
Like,

73
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,983
That's the first thing that someone's going to want to know.

74
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:02,508
And I think it is totally reasonable that we don't have the answer, but.

75
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,328
Yeah.

76
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:06,972
I think so.

77
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:30,414
So my understanding was that part of the feasibility study was to take a look at the various sites that have been proposed and you know obviously the existing site is one.

78
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:35,617
I think there had been a question about whether that could move down below the

79
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:43,389
the Jewish synagogue and incorporate that if that was a possibility.

80
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,071
I think there's been some discussion of

81
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:54,639
the park down there at the end of Playstead, and then the bush, or the, yeah, the bud.

82
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,182
I think that was just kind of out there, because it's such a nice place, and it's essentially relocated.

83
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:15,108
I don't know quite if any work has been done on any of those sites, but I think somebody has them in their notes, I think, that those were things to possibly investigate, as well as the existing site up on the fields and stuff.

84
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:22,109
I've no idea where it's at, but those are things I've heard.

85
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:46,637
Yeah, so I guess, Larry, in terms of what we're doing here, piggybacking off what you said, I think maybe just having that key question like Marissa said, but also maybe listing some of the sites that we've at least explored without committing ourselves to locking those spots down in stone.

86
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:58,815
Yeah, I mean, not to split hairs, but I do wonder if listing any sites, I mean, I think just, I think maybe listing- It might be premature.

87
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:07,940
Yeah, criteria for what's under consideration in a site, but I think listing anything specific just kind of, people look at stuff really quick and then run with it, so.

88
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,262
I think that's part of the feasibility study, because I don't have a clue.

89
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:20,153
I think it would be a good idea just to say, including the current location, because some people may- Sure.

90
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,354
Yeah, I think that's really important, Maria, good point.

91
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:26,296
All right.

92
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:38,482
So we should say- I think that could just go into that, do you share questions to be answered?

93
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,281
We could list it there could be.

94
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:41,941
I mean, I don't know.

95
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:52,534
I'm not entirely sure what the format would be, but, like, it could be, like, under study, you know, under consideration at the moment.

96
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,618
We'll know once the feasibility study gets underway.

97
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:14,815
or something like that, and we can either list specific places, including the new high school, or we can kind of just list general areas of space that are open.

98
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:21,363
Yeah, I mean, I would say, you know, a number of locations are under consideration, including the current site.

99
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:32,584
And it may be worth just another questions to be answered.

100
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:43,907
Like if there's just like a subtext underneath that, that's like, just basically says like the, the questions below are, you know, identifying answers to the questions below are part of this process.

101
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:47,087
Like, it's not like we're behind by not having answers to these questions.

102
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,308
It's just something that has to be figured out along the way.

103
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,073
Okay, is there.

104
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:21,715
I guess we'll just we'll just start kind of with the, are these good for the kind of the four main sections the.

105
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:33,018
Well, I guess three because we've technically not in stage two yet but just bringing it down as big stuff feasibility is stage one and then questions to be answered.

106
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:46,659
Yeah, I would just make sure in the project basics it references, and maybe it's in the project timeline, it just references the stages so that someone understands what, like, you know, why we're saying stage one and stage two below.

107
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,361
So just making sure that that's outlined elsewhere.

108
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:55,385
So maybe what does the MSBA process?

109
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:58,287
Something like that?

110
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:58,947
Yeah.

111
00:10:58,967 --> 00:10:59,688
Okay.

112
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:11,347
Is there, I guess now we'll just go section by section just so we cover our bases.

113
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:14,510
Is there anything else worth adding in this basic section?

114
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:20,756
What did Jenny say?

115
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:25,360
I mean, I think some of this stuff has been discussed previously and some of it may be in the notes.

116
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:26,181
I don't know.

117
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,716
I've toured several high schools.

118
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:30,677
I don't know.

119
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,898
I think Maria, you did one of them.

120
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:46,244
And I took a ton of notes, but we've never, you know, I don't, I think it's prematurity to the design stage, like, very specifically until we have the site and stuff.

121
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,025
But I, some of this stuff has been discussed previously.

122
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,287
So you may find it in the record already.

123
00:11:54,612 --> 00:12:14,809
Yeah, I guess I'm more concerned about the questions themselves rather than necessarily the answers at tonight, and then we can kind of collaborate what the answers will look like, which has been discussed throughout these meetings.

124
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:22,466
You know, I'm kind of stuck on the question, will the new Medford High School offer CTE programming?

125
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:25,928
Because it's almost making it sound like it hasn't been offering it.

126
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:45,620
I think maybe it should say, will continue to be, or that it's turned moving to a comprehensive school with both the CTE and high school together, or I'm just stuck on the wording there.

127
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,635
for the new Bedford High School?

128
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,959
Because that- The answer to that, I believe, is absolutely yes.

129
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,361
It'll just be- Alongside- Approved.

130
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,991
Or to be part of the high school complex, maybe?

131
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:23,975
I think you could just at the end, after continue to offer CTE programming alongside, you know, the traditional.

132
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,458
Yeah.

133
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,420
Yeah, alongside the traditional.

134
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:35,005
I don't think that's the right word, but yeah, high school curriculum or the yeah.

135
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:40,910
All right.

136
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:55,129
Yeah, so I can play around with that, but I think the genesis of making sure that we'll see TB offered, but also alongside what we're already teaching many of our students.

137
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,729
Yeah.

138
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,652
And then, yeah, is there anything else that sticks out here, or should we jump on to down below?

139
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,853
Just take that where will the high school be built out of this section.

140
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,440
We're taking this out and moving it down.

141
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,563
I think you already moved it down there, but.

142
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:18,724
It is listed to it.

143
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,106
All right.

144
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:25,470
I think it makes sense to have it below because like in this section, we're going to have like actual answers.

145
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:25,850
Right.

146
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,275
So having it in the section where it's just like, okay.

147
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:40,242
And then we're skipping stage two because we were not there quite yet.

148
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:41,203
Hopefully soon.

149
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:55,492
But then I guess in terms of stage one, this is where we can keep some of those documents that we already worked on, remind people of who was involved in this stage.

150
00:14:56,672 --> 00:15:04,317
And I think also just a little historical backdrop of kind of when and how.

151
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:14,120
Yeah, I wonder if the first question, just to get a bit more like powerful language, just say what was accomplished in this step, maybe rather than like what happened in this step.

152
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:58,223
Um, maybe was this the first time we went through instead of we, you could say like the Medford school committee or Medford high school building committee or something like that.

153
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,845
Is this, was this the first time.

154
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:13,676
Does that make more sense?

155
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:15,137
Yeah.

156
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,854
Yeah, and now I wasn't here for those first steps of the feasibility study.

157
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,995
But is there anything else that sticks out as part of that process?

158
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,339
I mean, I think this maybe is answered.

159
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,301
It's kind of addressed above, but I don't know if.

160
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:49,305
Like, are costs estimates revealed as part of the feasibility study?

161
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:56,410
Maybe that's like getting into the weeds, but I feel like if I saw feasibility study, I'd be like, oh, maybe they have, you know, dollar signs they got from the feasibility study.

162
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:05,396
For cost-free.

163
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,545
Does that make sense or should that be?

164
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:37,609
I think it makes sense as a non-construction manager, like a non-expert in this space.

165
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:48,053
Yeah, because I think here we can also say the city provided us money to go into a feasibility study as well.

166
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,834
Make that clear here.

167
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:51,495
Yeah, that's a good point.

168
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:53,696
OK.

169
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,540
Excuse me, do you guys have any questions that I can help with?

170
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,682
I've heard a lot of this stuff already discussed and I don't think I have a role to discuss it further.

171
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,463
So I'm not sure what else I can contribute tonight.

172
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:16,105
So unless you got a reason, I think I'm gonna, that's it.

173
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,426
If there's any reason to stay, I'm happy to do that.

174
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:23,307
But I don't quite understand what's going on here.

175
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:28,526
Yeah, I think we're mostly in the question asking part of the communications process.

176
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:28,807
OK.

177
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,889
Well, you guys got a good handle on that.

178
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:33,430
So I'll see you next time.

179
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,472
Thank you.

180
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:35,952
Thank you.

181
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:37,093
Have a good evening, all.

182
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:37,853
You too.

183
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:52,324
And then I think these are the big questions that people may still have about the project that we don't have answers yet to.

184
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,263
I guess there's only three listed.

185
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,904
Is there more to consider?

186
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:03,126
Let me look at the ones that were down below again.

187
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:07,288
Yeah.

188
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,390
I wonder if.

189
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:19,333
And then I also had some of these.

190
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:27,670
Oh yeah, I think that Kids Corner and yeah, I think Kids Corner, Curtis Tufts are important.

191
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,591
Right, I agree.

192
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:49,272
And then I don't know exactly what the answer for the, you know, how is this project or how will this project be funded?

193
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:55,095
I assume that's going to include the, like a reference to a debt exclusion or a potential debt exclusion.

194
00:19:55,655 --> 00:20:06,501
So I wonder if then in the questions to be answered, it's, you know, when can we expect, you know, when can voters expect to see something related to this project on the ballot?

195
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:27,105
Now I'm like, there's so many questions, I'm forgetting what I read up above.

196
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,667
But was there one, when will the project be finished?

197
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,948
Because I know that's another thing that we don't know.

198
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:34,869
But I don't know.

199
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,031
Yeah, there's a general project timeline question.

200
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,652
But yeah, I had that same thought, too.

201
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:47,156
It's still like, I mean, this is where I'm meeting a million meetings ago, I was saying it might be nice to kind of create like a graphic

202
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:55,340
timeline as opposed to a timeline that has actual dates on it, to be able to just be like, here's where we are in the process.

203
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:02,283
We have no idea how long this process is, but we're X percentage of the way through.

204
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:07,186
And the MSBA has some really good graphics about what the timeline looks like.

205
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:16,990
So I think it'd be kind of easy to just take what they have, apply it to us, and then even just stick that picture as the answers.

206
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:22,585
So, yeah, I like that idea, Marissa.

207
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,169
I can definitely help if we want to create any visuals as well.

208
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:29,469
That's.

209
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,750
My house.

210
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:31,810
Um.

211
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:39,315
Yeah, so I think these questions we, um.

212
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,986
I don't think we need to answer tonight.

213
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:47,449
I think Dave, a lot of them have already been answered kind of in the public meetings that we've had.

214
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:53,933
So I can either talk to Jenny or just go back to those meetings and pull some of the answers to them.

215
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:03,979
But in terms of what we're ready to publish and just because I know the questions that we have, many of the community members will have them as well.

216
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:04,159
So.

217
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,973
But if there's anything else you think is worth discussing for this, the link for it is in the chat.

218
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:21,135
So if it's easier to see it on that end.

219
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:23,596
Well, we'll have access to this, right?

220
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,156
Can we, are we commenters?

221
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:26,977
Yeah, you're full editors.

222
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:27,257
Yep.

223
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:28,438
So you can take the comment, but yeah.

224
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:28,558
Yep.

225
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:34,397
I assume this is like kind of a living document.

226
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:42,244
I mean, we wanna vote out something tonight so that we can get something up, but like anytime we meet, we can say, oh, I think we should add this, right?

227
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:43,485
Yeah, totally.

228
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:51,152
And then I can also, after the meeting ends, make it look a little more organized than these letters.

229
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:57,277
But Nicole, I guess in terms of voting, what is there to,

230
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,701
to kind of make sure it gets voted on tonight for this.

231
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:08,406
I think just like us like voting to approve this to, I assume the next step on your end is just to get it on the website.

232
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:13,730
So I think it would just be to vote to approve as is would be my thought.

233
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,692
Okay.

234
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:22,157
So do we have any further edits or do we feel comfortable having a motion to approve?

235
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:26,762
I'm comfortable having a motion, yeah.

236
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,622
All right.

237
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:28,623
Can I get a motion?

238
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,885
Motion to approve the document.

239
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:38,989
Motion to approve the document by Maria, seconded by... Seconded.

240
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,053
Well, you're non-voting as far as I know, so I think I can only get a vote from... Seconded.

241
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,454
Seconded by Marissa.

242
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:48,355
All those in favor?

243
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:48,435
Aye.

244
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,110
Thank you.

245
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,250
Hi.

246
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,831
I suppose.

247
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:53,532
All right.

248
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,113
The motion passes.

249
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:02,820
And then the other thing we have is, um, finalizing the community survey as well.

250
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:10,126
Um Marie, I'll I have I can put it up on my screen if you want to

251
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:31,241
So this document is obviously directed towards the faculty and staff of the high school.

252
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:37,524
So when we say community, I'm just limiting that community to the stakeholders here.

253
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:51,329
And I spoke with a couple of the teachers before I worked on this, and one of them said, you need to make sure you answer three questions.

254
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,189
What are we keeping?

255
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:52,969
What do you want?

256
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:53,790
What do you need?

257
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:03,893
So those questions, that actually directed how I asked the questions, and Will certainly cleaned it up, too, and made it

258
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:13,012
better by adding the last question as well, because people always want to know, is this going to be in confidence?

259
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:18,357
Is this going to, is my name going to be attached to this when I answer?

260
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,112
So it's pretty direct.

261
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:23,374
It's short, which is what we wanted.

262
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:42,988
And that was discussed at the last meeting that we just wanted a few questions to put it out there to staff and faculty and get them thinking about the process, get them invested in the process, and then let them start to guide us with some of their needs.

263
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:45,810
And maybe they'll think of some things that we haven't come up with.

264
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,728
I will share this out with everyone after.

265
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:59,457
I know Google Forms is really hard with sharing permissions these days, so I just want to make sure it gets into my hands.

266
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:03,163
So piggybacking off of what Maria said,

267
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:11,038
So the plan is to send this out to MHS staff members, kind of solicit their responses.

268
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:23,986
And then at the bottom, because they're kind of thinking about it, if they're interested in speaking on camera to the students, we met with Mr. Hester, who runs our film and TV production CTE program.

269
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:31,890
And he's got some students who are interested in helping us make a video just kind of outlining why we need a new high school.

270
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:33,672
We thought that,

271
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:46,425
It kind of formed it sounded as a narrative came from the student came from the mostly teachers, but also some of the students who fortunately won't be able to use the high school just because of the project timeline.

272
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:50,690
It'll kind of drive the narrative and the importance of why we need this building.

273
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,913
Um, effectively.

274
00:26:54,981 --> 00:27:03,447
Sean also talked about how much more effective it is to ask fewer questions rather than more questions.

275
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:07,250
And so that guided this forum as well.

276
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,934
And he's prepared to start as soon as we put this out.

277
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:22,120
He's very excited about being involved with the project and he even wanted to bring students to our meeting with Will.

278
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,567
And they're ready to go and they're ready to jump on it.

279
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,347
They're very excited about it.

280
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:32,228
Awesome.

281
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:36,789
Yeah, this looks good to me, I think, especially when you put the emphasis on just keeping it shorter.

282
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:43,331
I wonder if just question three, it just says, what are the components of the school that we need to keep?

283
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:48,432
I don't know if we need to be clear that it's physical components or like,

284
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:55,395
or space components or something, because I could just imagine someone writing a long thing about programming we need to keep.

285
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:56,415
And maybe that is an answer.

286
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,135
I could be wrong.

287
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:01,296
But I don't know if we're just looking for physical space responses.

288
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:08,978
Well, I think that kind of gets addressed in the next question as far as limits, talking classroom shops.

289
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,899
But if that needs to be reworded, that

290
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,810
No, but that's a good point.

291
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:23,335
I mean, yeah, maybe someone does answer just programmatically, but that's still helpful information because you say, okay, they really care about this program and we need to find space for it.

292
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:33,460
Or even if we just say what would need what that we need to keep thinking in terms of you and your students, maybe putting it that way.

293
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:37,642
Yeah, I think just getting your.

294
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:53,642
Yeah, I could be up for that, but I think getting your background information too, like I think that's, I understand it better now, like, you know, having these, I understand that the second question is like a little bit more about space and if people answer programmatically in the first question, then that still informs space.

295
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:56,563
Maybe just change the order.

296
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:08,267
Like if the want question is like really physical spaces and that like might get people more in the mindset of like answering about space

297
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:13,089
within the building as opposed to concepts.

298
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:14,830
I agree with that.

299
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,951
Yeah, that's a good point.

300
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:24,957
So now it's, what do you want to see in the new high school?

301
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:27,999
What do you want to keep from the old high school?

302
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,021
And then what do we need in the new?

303
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:33,303
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.

304
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:34,644
Yeah, I agree.

305
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,624
And then in terms of the video itself,

306
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:55,948
Sean said, Mr. Sean Hester said that, depending on how many people respond, the video itself is only going to be like three to five minutes, keeping it short, because our 2025 attention spans are not always the highest these days.

307
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:08,213
So keeping it short, and if we get a lot of great answers, he said his students are willing to kind of cut up some different variations that will still serve the same purpose.

308
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:14,110
And just for my understanding, this is the same video that's on the agenda.

309
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,213
This is the video we were going to talk about anyways later tonight.

310
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:28,421
Because I know there was an archive video we talked about a long time ago, just making sure this is the video that we had planned to talk about tonight.

311
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:29,141
Yes.

312
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:31,083
I think this is the first leg of it, right?

313
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:36,127
Because it will be an ongoing video series, I guess.

314
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,133
That's my understanding anyway.

315
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:39,673
Okay, great.

316
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:43,997
Yeah, I think I'm just like, yeah, I'm just making sure it's not, not making sure, I'm just making sure I'm talking about the right things.

317
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:52,183
I just remember their talk of like old library footage, like several meetings back and just making sure I'm talking about the same video as everyone else.

318
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:57,467
Yeah.

319
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,489
This survey looks good to me.

320
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:03,632
If folks have any other edits or thoughts.

321
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,691
this video will be later shared as part of the, I think just shared later.

322
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:21,672
This video will be shared like publicly later?

323
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:28,213
I just want to make it clear that like, if you're going to go on camera, like we're going to broadcast what you said.

324
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:33,594
Yeah, no, I just think later shared is a little clunky, just shared later.

325
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:36,575
Or even just shared as a part of community outreach.

326
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:40,753
You know, that's better.

327
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:41,593
Yes.

328
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,540
Do I have a motion to approve the survey as is.

329
00:31:55,922 --> 00:32:00,665
Motion to approve the survey motion to approve the survey from Marissa seconded by.

330
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,423
I'll second it, Maria, and then we'll vote.

331
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:10,047
So, Marissa, on the motion to approve the survey?

332
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:10,127
Yes.

333
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,650
Okay, one yes.

334
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,492
And Maria, on the motion to approve the survey?

335
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:16,132
Yes.

336
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:17,914
And myself?

337
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:18,514
Yes.

338
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:19,936
So that's three in the affirmative.

339
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:20,977
Motion passes.

340
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,501
And then we also just have on the agenda the video itself.

341
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,324
So if there's anything else you want to share about it, Maria?

342
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:37,116
No, actually, our conversation with Sean was pretty directed towards just this piece.

343
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:44,682
And then I think as we move along, they'll see where we go according to our process.

344
00:32:48,214 --> 00:33:05,177
He's got such a good handle on how this would be viewed to the public, what needs to be done, how to make it so that everybody will be able to, I guess, enjoy it and get something out of it by keeping things short.

345
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:09,318
I think it just will be ongoing.

346
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:14,779
At this time, I don't think there's really any plan other than that it will continue.

347
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:16,786
Okay, great.

348
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:17,066
Yeah.

349
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:24,635
So it sounds like the action plan where it stands now is basically get the survey out and start to collect this and then hand it off to the students.

350
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,958
And then as they edit together, go from there as it comes together.

351
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,800
Okay.

352
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,381
Yes.

353
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:35,773
As it is what you when you're dealing with students, that's pretty much the way it has to be anyway.

354
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:36,534
So right.

355
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,256
Right.

356
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:39,237
Okay, great.

357
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:45,284
Yeah, I don't know if we had to take any, I don't feel like we don't have to take any official action on that outside of we approve the survey, which includes the question.

358
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:47,647
So that's done.

359
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:49,529
So that covers our agenda.

360
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,272
Unless folks have anything else.

361
00:33:53,492 --> 00:34:09,077
I do have a question, and this is only because I was listening to some information about some of the other building projects, and one of the high schools costs about $250 million.

362
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:13,698
Is that the range that we're considering?

363
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:14,818
I don't know.

364
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:18,920
I know we haven't talked any money, but is that where we're at?

365
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
Is that what we're looking at?

366
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:23,567
Does anyone have any idea?

367
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:26,130
Because I was kind of floored at that.

368
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:38,345
From my personal architecture background, that's like an expensive school, but it is not like an order of magnitude off.

369
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:39,927
It will be up there.

370
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,229
Yeah, I just and that'll be like total project costs.

371
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:58,775
So not like the not only just the building that'll include all of the fees for the design team, the fees for the construction team, all of the equipment that goes to fitting out the building and everything like that.

372
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:03,377
And everything's finished landscaping and all of that.

373
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:04,457
Yeah.

374
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:09,753
Yeah, I just briefly looked up my alma mater, which is in full reverse.

375
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,353
It's not like a bells and whistles kind of place.

376
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:15,034
It is significantly larger than Medford High, and it was $263 million.

377
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:19,335
So yeah, I think at this point, it's definitely in that world.

378
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:19,395
OK.

379
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:23,977
Yeah, it's an incredible amount.

380
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:24,437
Yes.

381
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:38,187
staggering, especially, you know, I was somewhat involved in the K-8 school building, and the whole project, I think, was less than that.

382
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:48,634
I know that construction costs have really, really risen in the post-COVID era, like things have gone way, way, way up.

383
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,140
Yeah, I think I remember, I can't remember how much it costs.

384
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,981
I'd have to look it up.

385
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:58,305
I remember Newton North and like the big story about it being like the most expensive high school ever.

386
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:01,367
And now I feel like everything costs that much.

387
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:03,829
Right?

388
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:04,210
Yeah.

389
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:12,497
Well, I think Otis will have, will be kind of surprised when I saw, when it's revealed, but.

390
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:18,187
Yeah, yeah, but I think that's why part of the reason or debt exclusions are over 30 years.

391
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:26,030
So divided by X number of people over 30 years and it's a little less shocking, but it is, yeah, it's not an insignificant amount by any means.

392
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:34,994
Great, all right, thanks everyone for working so hard and for a very timely meeting.

393
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,715
I just need a motion to adjourn.

394
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:39,080
Motion to adjourn.

395
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,023
On the motion of Maria to adjourn, seconded by... Seconded.

396
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,724
Seconded by Marissa.

397
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,746
I will call the vote on the motion to adjourn.

398
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:49,487
Marissa?

399
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:49,567
Yes.

400
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:52,029
Maria?

401
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:52,669
Yes.

402
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:53,990
Myself?

403
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,350
Yes.

404
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,571
That's three in the affirmative.

405
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:56,672
The meeting is adjourned.
