[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I had a little technical difficulty.

7
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just get this up.

8
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:04,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks everybody for joining us.

9
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:10,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on my cell phone right now having a little bit of a problem, but we'll start off here.

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is called to order.

11
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:23,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of this meeting is to review the math curriculum K to 12 in the Medford Public Schools.

[SPEAKER_05]: And superintendent, if you could take it away.

27
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, everyone.

28
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:34,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us for today's curriculum subcommittee meeting.

29
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:42,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we are going to be taking a close look at mathematics instruction.

30
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Director of Mathematics, Ms.

31
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:52,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Faiza Khan, is going to be taking us through a slide deck, which will really talk about

32
00:03:53,675 --> 00:04:09,330
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, give us a quick overview of mathematics, the shifts that have happened, where we are, what are the specific standards that have to be met at the state level, and then she's going to dive into mathematics instruction.

33
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:16,737
[SPEAKER_03]: and the programming that is used at elementary, middle school level, and high school level.

34
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:31,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the presentation, she will share some goals and next steps for the math department and what it is that they are hoping to do to continue the work that they have been doing.

35
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to pass it on to Ms.

36
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:37,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Khan right now.

37
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should have screen sharing.

38
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:47,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have the ability to share you are listed as a co host.

39
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:48,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

40
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:49,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

41
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent.

42
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:54,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to everybody who is here today.

43
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

44
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:56,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

45
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, perfect.

46
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will start sharing my screen.

47
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:02,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

48
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:16,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I am not too sure where it is here.

49
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pulled it up.

50
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:20,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

51
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:23,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.

52
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:43,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have it pulled up in Safari, but it's not, it's making me go through the system preferences and whatnot.

53
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:46,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Is someone else- I can share it.

54
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask Dr. Cushing just to make me a host.

55
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me one second and I can share it.

56
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:51,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

57
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:19,686
Thank you.

58
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:29,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

59
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:30,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent.

60
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.

61
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.

62
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:40,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be doing this presentation because I feel like it was long overdue.

63
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Dr. Vincent said, I will be talking about how math looks like right now in Medford Public Schools.

64
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,536
[SPEAKER_01]: What have we done over the last two years?

65
00:06:54,937 --> 00:07:02,902
[SPEAKER_01]: and how Massachusetts curriculum frameworks have led to a district curriculum, and then the syllabi that we are working off of.

66
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can move on to the next slide.

67
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:06,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

68
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,413
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another just title slide.

69
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:14,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

70
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:31,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, the outline is that we'll talk about Common Core, the curriculum frameworks for Massachusetts, the district curriculum that we have adopted and that we have, and then the district program that we have adopted.

71
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:47,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Public Schools Mathematics Department curriculum and instruction, I'll be discussing that over the last two years because I assumed this role late August 2018.

72
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:54,897
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be talking about elementary grades and we will also be talking about secondary grades, middle and high school.

73
00:07:55,798 --> 00:08:08,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will close off after talking about equity in mathematics and our future goals and what I have in mind for the next steps for the department.

74
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take a step back and

75
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:30,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important that we look at this visual and really try to understand, you know, where our mathematics district program that we have adopted as a district is coming from.

76
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:45,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Any program that has been adopted by the mathematics department has been in line with whatever the district approved mathematics curriculum has been at that time.

77
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:51,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And the district approved mathematics curriculum has always come from Massachusetts,

78
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,843
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematics frameworks, which has been based on Common Core.

79
00:08:56,383 --> 00:09:20,921
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that we distinguish between Massachusetts mathematics frameworks, mathematics curriculum, which is approved by the district, and the district-adopted mathematics program, because I feel that more often than we should, we cross-reference them, and also that we somehow

80
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:24,448
[SPEAKER_01]: get mixed up between the three different pieces.

81
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:28,497
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can tell, I'll go to the next slide.

82
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:30,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

83
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:35,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to understand what is it all based on.

84
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:38,504
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks?

85
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:48,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for Mathematics has two different kinds of standards, content standards and practice standards.

86
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Content standards, they vary with grade.

87
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be teaching

88
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: the same content in grade one as I'll be teaching in grade two.

89
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:04,089
[SPEAKER_01]: But will I be teaching the same practice standards from different, you know, from grade one to grade three?

90
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will.

91
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:12,457
[SPEAKER_01]: They will take a slightly different shape when I look at them in the classroom, but they are the same eight.

92
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:20,987
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been set from 2011 to 2017, there have been very minor verbal changes, but they have stayed as eight.

93
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:30,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas content standards have changed, they have varied, they have been, they have modified verbally and in content as well.

94
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:40,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for Mathematics, as our previous visual explained, is the superset of district mathematics curriculum.

95
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:46,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we are deriving our district math curriculum based on Massachusetts frameworks.

96
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:57,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing to keep in mind is that Massachusetts curriculum frameworks for mathematics is based on common core standards.

97
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:01,536
[SPEAKER_01]: They were put together by a consortium of states several years ago.

98
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:13,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts as a state has added a few at different grade levels, its own standards, and we'll see it in a slide that's about to come.

99
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

100
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'll still stay on the same slide.

101
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you on the previous one.

102
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:24,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

103
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:34,075
[SPEAKER_01]: They are approved by DESE here in Massachusetts, and it's important that they are approved by DESE.

104
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,955
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way we get them.

105
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:50,259
[SPEAKER_01]: The programs that the district approve and district's own curriculum does not need DESE approval, but it's important that public schools stay in line with DESE's Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

106
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:59,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can't emphasize on this enough that the Massachusetts frameworks are not tied to any particular mathematics programs.

107
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:04,337
[SPEAKER_01]: DESE provides guidance in choosing programs, but they do not endorse any program either.

108
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:04,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

109
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the timeline.

110
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:21,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Before 1993, states were kind of teaching whatever they wanted.

111
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:34,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, Massachusetts would get together with another state that they will feel are more in line with their learning priorities and teaching priorities and will

112
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:39,093
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, form a set of standards and go from there.

113
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:52,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the Education Reform Act of 1993, everybody started thinking about what have we been teaching and are all different states teaching different standards.

114
00:12:53,477 --> 00:13:05,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they got together and they discussed it and they kind of had a common baseline that was called the mathematics state curriculum frameworks, it came around in about 1995 1996.

115
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Revisions happened in November 2000.

116
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:19,299
[SPEAKER_01]: More revisions happened in May 2004, but it only happened for grades three, five, and seven.

117
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet again, another set of revisions, March 2011.

118
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:31,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final set, the final frameworks that we are dealing with right now is the one that's based on December 2017.

119
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:33,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got it in 2018.

120
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:50,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the 2010 and basically with minor changes 2017 practice standards.

121
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:58,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the 2017 one and 2010 were slightly different, but basically they emphasized on the same

122
00:13:59,359 --> 00:13:59,900
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.

123
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,345
[SPEAKER_01]: All students shall be able to make sense of problems and they need to persevere in solving them.

124
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:10,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Second one is reason abstractly and quantitatively.

125
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain reasoning, model through applications, use appropriate tools strategically.

126
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:25,001
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be tools that students use with hands and any other kind of tools.

127
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,544
[SPEAKER_01]: that we introduce to students.

128
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,546
[SPEAKER_01]: They should attend to precision.

129
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:37,997
[SPEAKER_01]: They shall be able to look for and make use of structure and they should be looking for repetitions in patterns and calculations.

130
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: These again,

131
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you where they're all located.

132
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,963
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at them at different grade levels, how they look like.

133
00:14:47,443 --> 00:15:00,346
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the guiding principles when we go into the classrooms or when teachers are teaching to see our students persevering and how are they being encouraged to persevere.

134
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:07,008
[SPEAKER_01]: One important thing to note about Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks 2017 is that shifts from 2010 happened

135
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:15,312
[SPEAKER_01]: at a bigger level at the higher grades of 6 through 11.

136
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:21,655
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 seemed like it was pre-calculus, so it was not modified much.

137
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:29,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And the example is that the new grade 8 standards are now more rigorous and incorporate

138
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:46,785
[SPEAKER_01]: some standards that traditionally have been taught in Algebra I. And because I was teaching mathematics at that time from 2010 to 2018, I have witnessed these shifts my very self.

139
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,627
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I can talk more about these later, but we can go to the next slide.

140
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:59,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks 2017, there are a few highlights about it.

141
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,835
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much well-rounded curriculum.

142
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:07,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of emphasis on literacy now.

143
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:19,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we now are giving students a lot more word problems than they have seen in the past.

144
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:20,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually,

145
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:25,973
[SPEAKER_01]: ties in with procedural fluency as well.

146
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about it later.

147
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:33,255
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big emphasis on coherence, focus, and rigor.

148
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:39,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the curriculum should be coherent with each other from grade one to grade two to grade three.

149
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are talking about progression in grades here.

150
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:43,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be focused.

151
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,399
[SPEAKER_01]: In grade one, I should be focusing on such and such.

152
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,560
[SPEAKER_01]: In grade two, I shall be focusing

153
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,744
[SPEAKER_01]: on certain things and then so on and so forth.

154
00:16:53,804 --> 00:17:07,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, in grade one I shall be talking about integers, in grade two I shall be talking about, you know, divisions of certain numbers, for example, and in grade four

155
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:14,666
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of just modeling, students shall be able to do fractions by hand.

156
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where it is.

157
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:19,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I have given a link right here.

158
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It is right from the Massachusetts curriculum framework.

159
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:27,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a very well-rounded curriculum as claimed by DESE.

160
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:32,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, in teaching also, it sure is as compared to the 2010 curriculum.

161
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:45,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, again, when we go back to the same slide, it's important that the conceptual understanding, one more slide up, please.

162
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, right here.

163
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:52,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application, they stay together.

164
00:17:52,568 --> 00:18:00,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this triangle, you will see the purple one is saying make sense of mathematical concepts.

165
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And then procedural fluency is there.

166
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third one is application.

167
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:14,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And the three of them together, basically, the foundation of all of it is rigor.

168
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:18,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot more emphasis on rigor

169
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:32,517
[SPEAKER_01]: then there was in the 2000 frameworks and it was quoted by the mathematicians that it was a mile wide and only an inch deep.

170
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:40,260
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one is that the depth of the mathematical concepts increase as you go up in grade levels.

171
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are not totally discrediting the procedural fluency.

172
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be there too.

173
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:51,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But it needs to come after conceptual understanding.

174
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third piece will be now we are able to apply it.

175
00:18:54,989 --> 00:19:01,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts from understanding, goes to procedural fluency, and then it should be application.

176
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:09,338
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way the visual says it is that all three of them are equally important, and they need to

177
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,981
[SPEAKER_01]: form the mathematical rigor at each grade level.

178
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:20,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

179
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:35,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the chart where I mentioned that Massachusetts has put in some of their own standards, as you can see in counting and cardinality and operations and algebraic thinking.

180
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:42,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts has some standards in pre-k, it also has it in measurement and data and geometry.

181
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:51,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Also at fifth grade level, Massachusetts has introduced a couple of standards in the number system.

182
00:19:53,688 --> 00:20:00,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see clearly over here what is being taught at what grade level and how it progresses.

183
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, geometry is extremely important, which it wasn't in the 2001 and in the 2000 curriculum.

184
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recognized that it's really important.

185
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:17,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very logical concept and it's not just gonna happen if we start teaching students at the high school.

186
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:22,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of it is spread out through all the grades.

187
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our high school course offerings and pretty much the 17 courses that are offered at the high school level are here.

188
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:45,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I can come back to this if needed, but here they are.

189
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:49,225
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also on the mathematics department website.

190
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:57,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

191
00:20:57,754 --> 00:21:01,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the initiatives.

192
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:06,817
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we have been doing since 2018 up until now.

193
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:10,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We have conducted several math learning walks.

194
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:16,841
[SPEAKER_01]: They are on pause for this particular school year due to COVID.

195
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,402
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw where we

196
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:23,603
[SPEAKER_01]: need improvements where we can support our teachers.

197
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:31,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait for these to start back up again because they gave us some very good data.

198
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:40,406
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle school program review and adoption was completed and elementary school program review and adoption has been paused.

199
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:48,728
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a committee formed of teachers and we had barely started, you know,

200
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,946
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking at different programs when COVID hit in March.

201
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:00,809
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the presentations from the vendors had started.

202
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We had formed a rubric as to what will be our criteria.

203
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:13,361
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in line with DESE, and we have been in talks with DESE to

204
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:20,067
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get an idea of when the next curriculum frameworks will be coming in.

205
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:21,048
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know yet.

206
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:27,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at different rubrics that were used in the towns.

207
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:34,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the teacher input, we basically went with one rubric.

208
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:58,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That work had started in October of 2019 and it took us good five or six months to get to a rubric, but we were in good place because a lot of that rubric development also needed a little bit of professional development because we want to have an elementary school program

209
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:05,106
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in line with the middle school program.

210
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a problem-based, inquiry-based program.

211
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:16,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were going to go ahead and pilot it.

212
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:25,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it is paused for this year, but we know where we are at and will hopefully resume it under better conditions.

213
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Evaluations of curriculum and instruction, they are ongoing.

214
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The inventory of current resources.

215
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,817
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ongoing as well.

216
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:40,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Transition to inquiry-based, hands-on instructional resources.

217
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: We are always on the lookout.

218
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:44,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We are always open-minded.

219
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: We always encourage people to give us thoughts, give us ideas, because, you know, as I see it, as we see it,

220
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just on to the teachers.

221
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:00,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just up to me.

222
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,119
[SPEAKER_01]: We need parent input.

223
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:14,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any parent or any teacher comes across a tool, a program, we are more than happy to look into it and make them partners in our teaching and learning.

224
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:23,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Elementary school summer math calendars were given out in June of 2019.

225
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:36,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And in June of 2020, we had a good success rate with the collection of the summer calendars.

226
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:46,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year in 2020, we did not have that much luck this year, but they were there in case anybody was interested.

227
00:24:50,888 --> 00:25:03,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So for elementary grades, under programming, we have the envisions program that was adopted in 2014.

228
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,572
[SPEAKER_01]: As the core program, we still have it.

229
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:15,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we also got was envisions 2020 as a supplemental resource at no cost.

230
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:20,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, when you get a program at no cost, there are pros and cons to it.

231
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:33,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided to say yes to that offer because it is a more robust and clearly has a few advantages over 2014.

232
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:44,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional considerations is that we renewed hand visions this year for a cost of $50,000 plus paper materials.

233
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:48,559
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated budget request for 2020-2022 will be approximately the same.

234
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:52,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say budget request for 2021 and 2022 will approximately be the same.

235
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies for that mistake.

236
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:06,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Program Review Committee October 2019 goals and status.

237
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:08,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I mentioned it.

238
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:18,880
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is that we need to stay with the procedural fluency, but before that comes the conceptual understanding and after that comes the application.

239
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:36,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure the new program is in line with that and that it's coherent time to time we hear from our teachers that you know it's just not tying in it's just not connecting and that's why teachers at all different grade levels from different schools.

240
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: are on that committee of about 20 teachers and administrators are as well so that they can give us the feedback.

241
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:53,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Our final goal is to make a recommendation to the school committee for adoption of the new program and we are hoping to do it for June 2022.

242
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the middle school grades, we adopted a new program.

243
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: The name is illustrative mathematics and it was in June 2019.

244
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:19,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, the status of the middle schools was that we were using at least three

245
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,183
[SPEAKER_01]: to different middle schools.

246
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:36,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing was very important for me personally as well was that we are on one platform because we have a goal of having one Medford.

247
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:51,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we looked at different programs, we saw that illustrative mathematics clearly has major advantages over other programs, which seem to be

248
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,830
[SPEAKER_01]: more procedural.

249
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,173
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was very inquiry-based, and that's how it was from the beginning.

250
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:03,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't cut out to pass a certain criteria.

251
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: The authors wrote illustrative math.

252
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:14,523
[SPEAKER_01]: They put examples and questions and activities in illustrative math, and then it passed the criteria.

253
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:21,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, basically, are you teaching to the test kind of scenario that I was seeing with different programs.

254
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:37,610
[SPEAKER_01]: There is definitely lots of emphasis on problem-solving, inquiry-based, hands-on activities, and that's for our standard 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms.

255
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,511
[SPEAKER_01]: About 85% of our students fall in that category.

256
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,572
[SPEAKER_01]: The big ideas is for the accelerated program.

257
00:28:46,652 --> 00:29:00,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional consideration at the middle school level is that professional development was done in illustrative math two full days in June 2019 before the teachers were going to start using it in end of August beginning of

258
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:13,495
[SPEAKER_01]: September in 2019 and then we followed up with two hours in the same school year 2019 and 2020 to launch the program.

259
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:24,658
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent about $25 per student per year on the paper book.

260
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:32,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The program itself is free and it's all available online for families, for students, and for teachers.

261
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:38,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It has lesson plans and condensed lesson plans and many resources for the teachers.

262
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:53,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing to keep in mind is that when I say online, uh, people assume, uh, we assume that a lot of it is, uh, that students are doing all the work, um, online.

263
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's not the case.

264
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:57,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Students still need paper and pencil.

265
00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:00,387
[SPEAKER_01]: They still need to show their work by hand.

266
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:09,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And teachers use nowadays in during COVID conditions, they are using different technology tools to make that happen.

267
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:14,710
[SPEAKER_01]: program itself is not just you are constantly working on the computer.

268
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:20,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can take it as a pro or we can take it as a con but that's where we are with illustrative math.

269
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:25,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So approximate paper cost per teacher per set is $125.

270
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one-time investment.

271
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,967
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought it for all of our special education teachers and all of our

272
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:35,773
[SPEAKER_01]: English language teachers as well.

273
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:43,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximate PD cost was about $15,000 for the program adoption and coaching.

274
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,149
[SPEAKER_01]: That included my coaching as well.

275
00:30:48,110 --> 00:31:02,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and the coaching of our EL teachers so that they can modify the program as need be for their needs.

276
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now we can go to the high school.

277
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the high school grades, the program that we are using that comes as a set of Algebra 1 Geometry and Algebra 2, when we adopt a program for the courses at the high school, we usually look for the sequence that the program offers the sequence of Algebra 1 Geometry and Algebra 2.

278
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,365
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Houghton, Mifflin, Harcourt.

279
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:44,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we do it is because these three courses, of all the others, are the foundations.

280
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:50,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure they're coherent and they're focused, so we don't go with Pearson in one and Houghton, Mifflin in another one.

281
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:52,356
[SPEAKER_01]: That was

282
00:31:56,508 --> 00:32:01,353
[SPEAKER_01]: adopted in 2016 and we paid for the program.

283
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:02,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all paid for.

284
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:16,228
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaining courses use Pearson, McGraw-Hill, HMH, Addison-Wesley, BFW, Prentice Hall, Desi's own binder, and Skylight Publications.

285
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,931
[SPEAKER_01]: for different programs.

286
00:32:20,832 --> 00:32:26,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional considerations is that we have invested in new statistics books.

287
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:33,321
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones come with an online interactive book.

288
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:36,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the paper book and we have the online version.

289
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:48,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was bought right in time because our students are using it very nicely and teachers are getting used to it in October 2020 we bought it.

290
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:50,339
[SPEAKER_01]: with $6,000.

291
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,161
[SPEAKER_01]: The HMH program renewal is due in June 2022.

292
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:16,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We have yet to get a quote on it, but this program that we have in, that we got in 2016, basically we will keep their paper books, but the online piece of it, of the Houghton, Mifflin, Harcourt, the Algebra I Geometry and Algebra II,

293
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:23,249
[SPEAKER_01]: we will have, we'll no longer have access to it after June of 2022.

294
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:31,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to think about where we want to go and if we want to renew, you know, what will be the dollar cost associated with it.

295
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:38,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So the program review committee for that one needs to be formed and the plan is to

296
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:51,440
[SPEAKER_01]: form it in June 2022 because that's when the elementary school program committee will be ending its work and hopefully will be adopting a program.

297
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:57,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that it'll be a good time to start working on this.

298
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:04,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually does not take this long, but because of COVID, the elementary school program review committee

299
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,812
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to put it on pause.

300
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:16,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully this will be done by June of 2023 and we will either have a new program or we'll stick to the program that we have.

301
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So equity in mathematics.

302
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:26,846
[SPEAKER_01]: We are fully compliant with the Office of Civil Rights regulations.

303
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:34,390
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a yearly program curriculum bias sign-off sheet for racial, religious, and gender equity.

304
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:42,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We do an annual discussion on how to deal with unconscious bias in program and practice through targeted teacher feedback sessions.

305
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:44,775
[SPEAKER_01]: and in math department meetings.

306
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:50,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We are committed to an assumptions-free all-inclusive teaching and learning models.

307
00:34:51,777 --> 00:35:07,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We promote co-teaching as much as possible and the professional development and modeling is done by better lessons at the middle school level and at the high school level because it was specially requested

308
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,201
[SPEAKER_01]: from them.

309
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:22,246
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the teacher that we had for our illustrative math program was a special education teacher who gave much feedback on how to include our special population.

310
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Our future goals and next steps.

311
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:31,650
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to continue the learning walks K through 12 starting in September 2021.

312
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,552
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to develop a department mission statement because

313
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:43,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's important that we have a mission and we keep it in mind.

314
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:48,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Continued work on developing and updating the core syllabi.

315
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,224
[SPEAKER_01]: As we are adopting new books and as we have

316
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:57,446
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 frameworks.

317
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:10,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The district curriculum was updated in line with the DESE Massachusetts frameworks, but we are working on syllabi of a few courses.

318
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:17,751
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some technical difficulty that some of them were only in PDF.

319
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:22,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are working towards them.

320
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:24,056
[SPEAKER_01]: We are almost done.

321
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:30,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue to research best mathematical practices across the state to incorporate in our classrooms.

322
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:39,910
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about the mathematics department, at least at the secondary level, because they only teach mathematics is their

323
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,595
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously researching best mathematical practices.

324
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:56,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Many teachers at the elementary schools are also constantly engaged in it, and they're very interested in what's happening in the mathematical world, and that's definitely good news for us.

325
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We are closely monitoring the new trends in mathematics.

326
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:07,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Teachers are eager to learn, continue to promote inquiry-based teaching and learning

327
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:13,800
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way we see that learning is happening best.

328
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:26,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Those days are long gone when there was a traditional setup and now until students touch and feel the actual, you know, bits and pieces.

329
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:32,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't play around with stuff or they don't discuss with each other.

330
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,034
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not where we would like them to be.

331
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:41,319
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like them to become competitive, more competitive in the world.

332
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:48,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that group discussion and inquiry-based teaching is the way to go and group-based learning.

333
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:56,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue to research and incorporate data driven strategies to minimize learning loss due to COVID-19.

334
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself am constantly trying to research and look for things that I can give to the teachers.

335
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:13,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I again, hate to be the bearer of the bad news, but I was reading Education Week just very lately.

336
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:23,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And it mentioned that the loss in mathematics overall throughout the country is gonna be twice as much as the loss in literacy.

337
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to raise the red flag.

338
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:30,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, this is where we are right now.

339
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:32,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue to strive.

340
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:35,507
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to bring it to everybody's attention.

341
00:38:35,948 --> 00:38:40,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And my last slide is saying thank you for your time.

342
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And please let me know if you have any questions.

343
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:47,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Pfizer, thank you so much.

344
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a very comprehensive report with so much information built in.

345
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:04,854
[SPEAKER_05]: you ended up really on the key point that I think we're all concerned about is what will be the impact of this year.

346
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:15,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially, like I can, if I think about eighth grade, the eighth grade course, we've talked about many, many times how intense that is.

347
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:24,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now those kids have gone on into ninth grade, and I'm wondering what the teachers are telling you and what you're seeing so far.

348
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,501
[SPEAKER_01]: So teachers are struggling in this way.

349
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they are in charge.

350
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:35,543
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of resources at their hand.

351
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:36,843
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working very hard.

352
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:43,085
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is that there is a decline.

353
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:51,747
[SPEAKER_01]: The students are not where they are supposed to be from whatever standard, but they are not there.

354
00:39:52,847 --> 00:40:02,769
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make sure that students are engaged and they are ready for the next grade level.

355
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:17,732
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many teachers, actually all teachers are concerned that they will have to do a lot of catching up and they are concerned how much below grade level teaching they will have to do.

356
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:22,954
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are confident that they will put in their best effort.

357
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:30,077
[SPEAKER_01]: They are willing to go an extra mile for the students and I'm willing to help them.

358
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:31,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to help them.

359
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:36,881
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is there is a decline that's already very noticeable.

360
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:46,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious whether you're seeing a difference in the students who are fully remote versus the students who are hybrid.

361
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:58,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So that difference has not become very clear yet at the middle school and at the high school level.

362
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:02,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that if the situation stays so

363
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:14,554
[SPEAKER_01]: during these winter months and this holiday season, we will be able to better speak about it in February and early March timeframe.

364
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:27,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, teachers are, you know, using all these different strategies, Jamboard and Flipgrid and Whiteboard, all online to keep them engaged.

365
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,343
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am seriously concerned

366
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:36,605
[SPEAKER_01]: about this engagement going down during the winter months.

367
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:50,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is some difference, but there are certainly some very motivated students who are remote, and there are some students who are not as engaged, even if they are coming in.

368
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,630
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping that teachers are

369
00:41:56,936 --> 00:42:04,798
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna continue working hard with the students and that, you know, students will also not give up.

370
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are responding very positively.

371
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have hopes.

372
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:16,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on mute, Ms.

373
00:42:16,502 --> 00:42:17,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot, you're on mute.

374
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm having some issues.

375
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:28,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't unmute myself except by the space bar, and I can't go into a gallery view, so I can't see other people's questions.

376
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:35,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Jenny, I'm gonna ask you if you can, can you see, if you can see everybody, could you call on people for questions?

377
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:40,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted, Jenny.

378
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:42,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm muted.

379
00:42:42,596 --> 00:42:42,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

380
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau, I think I saw that you had your hand in the air.

381
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:46,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some questions as well.

382
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

383
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

384
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,205
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an awful lot to digest here.

385
00:42:52,485 --> 00:43:02,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And without getting into the issues around the pandemic, I was curious about the placement of computer science and computer programming in the list.

386
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:06,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are some courses that are in the math department, some that aren't.

387
00:43:07,547 --> 00:43:14,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was also curious about how young are we going to go with actual computer science curriculum?

388
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:16,629
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of evidence, I think,

389
00:43:17,977 --> 00:43:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Kindergarten's fine.

390
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start in kindergarten.

391
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:29,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we wait until high school or late middle school, then what we have is the people who know how to program taking classes so they can get their easy A's.

392
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not really the goal of any of this.

393
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:39,920
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, Mr. Russo, and something that's very close to my heart.

394
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:45,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I was teaching that AP computer science course before taking on this role.

395
00:43:46,504 --> 00:43:49,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, a pipeline would be wonderful.

396
00:43:50,727 --> 00:43:51,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.

397
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:54,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Students can start very early and very young.

398
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:03,535
[SPEAKER_01]: What DESE has done recently is that they have created a digital literacy set of standards.

399
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:06,656
[SPEAKER_01]: that do not fall under mathematics any longer.

400
00:44:07,556 --> 00:44:14,178
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain courses that they have said it's okay to take for math credit or for science credit.

401
00:44:14,638 --> 00:44:27,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two courses that fall in the mathematics department, they are in the mathematics department, but if students request a science credit for it, we are happy to give it to them.

402
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:31,203
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why they have stayed in the mathematics department is

403
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:50,390
[SPEAKER_01]: that traditionally a mathematics teacher has taught these courses and also because, according to Desi's guidelines and the licensure pieces that that there is a certain amount of time that teachers can teach outside of their

404
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,831
[SPEAKER_01]: content area.

405
00:44:52,392 --> 00:45:00,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the teachers would teach at the high school, three levels of the three sections of mathematics and one section of computer.

406
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,620
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I did it.

407
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:06,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But lately they have shifted their standards and their requirements.

408
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:11,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little fluid right now, but just so you know, that's where we are at.

409
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, creating a pipeline is great.

410
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:20,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Molly Ladin has put in a lot of effort in getting this off the ground.

411
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:28,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be her partner, but because she's in technology, we had decided that it's best served.

412
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,531
[SPEAKER_01]: by her and her crew.

413
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:45,177
[SPEAKER_01]: She has introduced a few courses also in computer science and, for example, computer science principles, which is not as rigorous, but it is still an AP course and it's not language based.

414
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:49,138
[SPEAKER_01]: This course that falls under the mathematics department is based on Java.

415
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to know Java very well in order to teach it.

416
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the way

417
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:19,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I always felt as a teacher of that course is that it will be great to have students have, you know, even a semester long course before they enter into into this, but that's again something that me and Molly are talking about and had it been better times.

418
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:22,461
[SPEAKER_01]: we would have definitely proceeded on with it.

419
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:30,107
[SPEAKER_01]: But any other things, we partner with each other and I'm happy to support her in any way, shape or form.

420
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

421
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some questions as well.

422
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:43,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna go ahead and ask them now, because I don't see any other hands in the air.

423
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:50,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So Faiza, I know that the work that you were doing around elementary school math

424
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,061
[SPEAKER_04]: was an effort to evaluate the replacement of envisions.

425
00:46:55,161 --> 00:47:04,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously that's sort of waylaid, but like envisions gets pretty terrible marks in the curriculum world.

426
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:18,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the time this is done, we will have lost an entire like school full of elementary school students to a curriculum that isn't even up to standard

427
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:20,204
[SPEAKER_04]: minimally.

428
00:47:20,344 --> 00:47:26,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just feel like that makes the teachers have to work that much harder to sort of cover the gap, right?

429
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the curriculum can't stand on its own, then the teachers are faced with having to fill the gap or you are.

430
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:47,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not particularly sure like what we would do about that, except that I think we need to temper our expectation that

431
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: any sort of math outcomes would change unless we are willing to change our foundation.

432
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been thinking a lot about that.

433
00:47:59,994 --> 00:48:13,838
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we talked about in terms of this work of the curriculum subcommittee is that we would ultimately create a catalog that would include things like program expiration dates, because it's definitely my sense that

434
00:48:15,964 --> 00:48:24,488
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of behind our expiration dates at this point where we should, you know, in a more perfect world, we would be making these evaluations before our programs expire.

435
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:34,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're faced with, you know, really, we're going to be asking the community to pay for a program to extend next year that we know isn't working.

436
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it is a pandemic and

437
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:49,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure what we can do about it in this moment except to say we don't want to be in that situation again and how do we sort of have different rigor so that we get to a better place.

438
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:09,287
[SPEAKER_04]: You know one thing that we talked about and as part of the approved motion is that this catalog would include not just the program, but also those expiration dates, so that it's a really easy visual to look at and say this is this is the date that we're working towards.

439
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as whether the curriculum has EL or IEP supplements and whether we have purchased them because it's my understanding that like in history, we haven't always purchased all those supplements.

440
00:49:23,722 --> 00:49:26,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it's that they don't exist and sometimes it's that we didn't buy them.

441
00:49:27,085 --> 00:49:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to start to create that catalog that makes that super clear, not just at the elementary level, but sort of across the board, I think makes a lot of sense.

442
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:39,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you have the,

443
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:44,169
[SPEAKER_04]: the beginnings and sort of the guts of that here in this presentation.

444
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:55,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think my question about some of the high school stuff really goes more toward the

445
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: another approved motion that is sitting in this committee that isn't necessarily the subject of today, but the subject of math progression and best practices around math progression, especially as you like move from middle to high school.

446
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:13,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just don't want us to lose sight of that important conversation.

447
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:14,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to

448
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:24,569
[SPEAKER_04]: have a meeting dedicated to that topic because I just heard from a friend today that she's got a middle schooler and the math teacher is talking to her about like what she needs to do.

449
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:28,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So her child ends up in calculus and I thought of you immediately.

450
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:33,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I, I really want to like circle back to that conversation.

451
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:39,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, I think I would be really interested in that conversation, which is obviously not the posted reason for today, but

452
00:50:41,877 --> 00:51:09,698
[SPEAKER_04]: What I couldn't tell from this presentation and maybe like when we create that catalog, it would be more clear is for the various courses and the textbooks, where are we in terms of like renewal, if renewal is a thing when it comes to like high school textbooks versus like elementary programs and like what should be our priority order

453
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:13,774
[SPEAKER_04]: as we think about planning and budgeting.

454
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:38,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that was like a lot of thoughts, but I think my question is like, what's your perspective on like how we do a better job to sort of plan proactively rather than being in this situation that I think you find yourself in fairly new to the job and we all find ourselves in saying we're gonna spend money on things we don't believe are gonna work and we are,

455
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:43,436
[SPEAKER_04]: having to do extensions when they may or may not serve our students.

456
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:50,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely agree with much of what you said.

457
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:56,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe having a catalog, having an Excel sheet will definitely help.

458
00:51:56,248 --> 00:52:02,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll give a one glance picture of where we are at and that way we are all not

459
00:52:03,776 --> 00:52:11,526
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, trying to go for the same amount of money that same year, you know, that will help us, you know, kind of categorize it.

460
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:12,066
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

461
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:14,710
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is when this math program is done.

462
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:20,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can invest in certain because all departments are equally important.

463
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:20,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to

464
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:23,499
[SPEAKER_01]: undermine any of them.

465
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I think that will be a good place to start.

466
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:38,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that if this, again, this pandemic would not have hit, you probably would have seen me in March coming to you with an elementary school program because teachers were ready to pilot.

467
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that is what I heard.

468
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They were ready.

469
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:44,132
[SPEAKER_01]: They really were ready.

470
00:52:44,272 --> 00:52:48,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were so, you know, ready for those presentations.

471
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:54,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to pull a plug on it because there was so much going on that was beyond our control.

472
00:52:55,197 --> 00:53:02,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, because we didn't come to you, we are not gonna come to you this March, it's postponed by another year.

473
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:09,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we've unfortunately, I feel that teachers do need a baseline program.

474
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:19,462
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be the one that we want, but it also provides students with some kind of online access at home as well.

475
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:20,502
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to,

476
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:22,784
[SPEAKER_01]: give them the basics.

477
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:35,837
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bullet that we will have to bite, but I believe that we are next year in March, you will most definitely see me.

478
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:44,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for that one, and then for the high school one, um, uh, I believe it's, it's a good solid program.

479
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:53,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the textbook is the main thing behind the textbook is basically rigor at the high school for the algebra one geometry and algebra two.

480
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are in a good place with that statistics is an excellent book.

481
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:59,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the teachers are really liking it.

482
00:53:59,622 --> 00:54:00,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Students are enjoying it.

483
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:05,667
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other ones that we will have to review.

484
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:10,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, advanced algebra and trigonometry might be coming up the pipeline.

485
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:14,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And discrete mathematics might be coming up the pipeline.

486
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:20,962
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are also courses that are not defined by DESE.

487
00:54:21,522 --> 00:54:28,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-calculus, we have been looking for a good pre-calculus book for some time and we have asked publishers for it.

488
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:32,368
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that we are using are really old, but they are good.

489
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:35,410
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of get our students ready for calculus.

490
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:51,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all of this in mind and we constantly discuss it, but I would say our eyes need to be possibly on the next two programs will be the advanced algebra and trigonometry, if there's a good book out there for it.

491
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, you know, the discrete mathematics one.

492
00:54:55,871 --> 00:55:00,632
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a book, but it's not in line with what we would like to

493
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,233
[SPEAKER_01]: what are we want our students to achieve.

494
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:15,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can go course by course and give you more details, but I say the bigger chunk is coming with the algebra one geometry algebra to think and also I just wanted to keep you in the loop that as we bought statistics book.

495
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:16,798
[SPEAKER_01]: books.

496
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:29,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that the actual paper book only cost about 20 $25 and a six year subscription of the book cost about hundred and 30 something dollars.

497
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:31,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how publishers have switched it.

498
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:41,367
[SPEAKER_01]: These books that, you know, are heavy duty hardcover books, they used to cost the department hundred and $20 a piece and not anymore.

499
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:43,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are seeing a different trend.

500
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:43,908
[SPEAKER_01]: So

501
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:52,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to have invested in the statistics books and thank you so much for your generosity and giving an okay to that.

502
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:53,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

503
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Rousseau.

504
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:58,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

505
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:12,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting back to the issue of the falling behind that the pandemic is causing, I feel like there's different

506
00:56:13,355 --> 00:56:29,002
[SPEAKER_02]: situations in the elementary school, kids that are staying in elementary school, I feel like, I mean, you could tell me I'm wrong, but I feel like the opportunity to get them where they are and move them forward to try and catch them up or at least keep them progressing is one thing.

507
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're finishing Algebra 1 and you're taking Algebra 2, the Algebra 2 teacher

508
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:37,572
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't teaching algebra one.

509
00:56:37,912 --> 00:56:46,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like there's these cutoffs and this progression in the later years that are just seem more challenging to figure out.

510
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you expect the geometry teacher to teach whatever the typical course before that is?

511
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:58,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are you having conversations in your department about what you're gonna do there?

512
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:00,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like the staff

513
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:03,538
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't know how many teachers there are.

514
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:12,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't know if the geometry teacher is only a geometry teacher and doesn't know how to teach algebra, but you know, are you having those conversations and what are your thoughts?

515
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just was reading the news today.

516
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good scene.

517
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:20,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like next fall, we are definitely going to have no kids that are going to be vaccinated.

518
00:57:22,124 --> 00:57:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just terrifying to imagine that we're going to enter the next school year, either in hybrid or whatever.

519
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:29,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And

520
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a bit concerned about what are the options?

521
00:57:36,597 --> 00:57:40,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need something from us to try and help the teachers?

522
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:53,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is again a very good question and I would say communication is the key with this piece.

523
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:57,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have been in constant communication with the teachers.

524
00:57:58,154 --> 00:58:06,281
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had department meetings and we have also had individual meetings 15 to 20 minutes long as to where are you really feeling

525
00:58:07,261 --> 00:58:07,962
[SPEAKER_01]: the challenge.

526
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:30,350
[SPEAKER_01]: What did not help us at the high school level was that DESE had announced initially that they will be giving the MCAS, that the juniors that just recently became juniors because they didn't take MCAS in May, they will now be taking it in January.

527
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:36,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we were concerned at the high school level as to how are we going to prepare kids.

528
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:48,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So should Algebra 2 teacher who is the teacher of a junior and the child, the student will be taking MCAS now in January because they didn't take it in May, should they stop teaching Algebra 2 and start teaching Geometry?

529
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Geometry, because MCAS is based on Geometry and Algebra 1.

530
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:56,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have had those conversations.

531
00:58:57,854 --> 00:59:00,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, our next meeting is again dedicated to it.

532
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:05,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So that danger is gone now that it's not happening in January, but it will happen.

533
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:07,179
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not say it's gone.

534
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:10,901
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of postponed it and haven't told us when it will happen.

535
00:59:11,401 --> 00:59:14,723
[SPEAKER_01]: My suspicion is that it might happen in May with the sophomores.

536
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:23,187
[SPEAKER_01]: We are dedicating our department meeting just to see what we can do.

537
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:35,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate that the teachers, educators, dedicated educators who want to emphasize on student learning are going to have to set aside a certain time.

538
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:37,916
[SPEAKER_01]: to teach to the test.

539
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:39,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really unfortunate.

540
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:43,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that this is not a good place to be.

541
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,984
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very unmotivating for an educator, but this is the reality.

542
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we have discussed it.

543
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:59,812
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we are working on plans for not just for the gaps in learning, but also for MCAS.

544
00:59:59,832 --> 01:00:04,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So all teachers are keeping a record of where they are in pacing guide and what's

545
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:10,318
[SPEAKER_01]: causing the delay and or how much depth did they go in in any topic.

546
01:00:10,839 --> 01:00:12,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that's really important.

547
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:25,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if I'm teaching geometry and I am and geometry has a lot of algebra one embedded in it and a student is unable to do the algebra in it.

548
01:00:25,787 --> 01:00:26,467
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?

549
01:00:26,588 --> 01:00:32,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I sit and should I review at the beginning of the year or should I embed the

550
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:36,132
[SPEAKER_01]: the teaching for that gap in the middle.

551
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:48,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics is constantly in tune with these and their recommendation is that for now, continue to fill in the gaps as need be.

552
01:00:48,657 --> 01:00:59,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't, you know, spend first two months in basically reviewing because you'll be behind in teaching your own grade level stuff and that'll be unmotivating again.

553
01:01:00,572 --> 01:01:10,861
[SPEAKER_01]: and a teacher of geometry doesn't want to teach algebra one for first two, three weeks because they'll be behind on their standards.

554
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:18,046
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to keep these recommendations in mind that are coming to us from experts.

555
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:23,611
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep a very realistic eye on where we are at and our expectations

556
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:27,852
[SPEAKER_01]: from all different parties in this game.

557
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:40,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Really important that we don't overestimate and that we keep in mind student engagement and making connections with the students and everything else will come afterwards.

558
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:42,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at least my philosophy.

559
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:43,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

560
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:47,375
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me very happy and I'm not surprised.

561
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really needed to hear you say all that.

562
01:01:49,696 --> 01:01:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

563
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that the superintendent had her hand up.

564
01:01:54,849 --> 01:02:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had put my hand up a little earlier in regards to the work that's happening in the math department.

565
01:02:02,772 --> 01:02:12,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And in speaking and working with Faiza and her leadership of the math department, the way the middle school team

566
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: adopted the illustrative math and how that was really rigorous, hands-on, and deeply engaging for the students.

567
01:02:24,285 --> 01:02:31,787
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've spoken about, is there a junior version to like an illustrative math that could be adopted at the elementary level?

568
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm oversimplifying it, but saying like, that's the direction we wanna move in.

569
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:44,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And so knowing the professional development that happened and the training that

570
01:02:45,570 --> 01:03:01,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the adoption happened right at the end of the school year, we had to, you know, squeeze the training in in June, and like, you know, almost force feed it so quickly in order for the teachers to be accustomed or acclimated to the new curriculum.

571
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, as

572
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:11,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Pfizer explained this year, COVID kind of had her put the brakes on it, but that truly was the hope.

573
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:19,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other piece of work that she did which I was very excited about was actually going to other districts

574
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:34,461
[SPEAKER_03]: with strong mathematical outcomes and looking at what they were using in their particular districts, and then trying to say, hmm, could something like that work in the Medford context?

575
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,102
[SPEAKER_03]: How much training would be necessary for that?

576
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:47,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in planning for today's presentation, where I know to member Graham's point about it's unfortunate now that

577
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:52,872
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to pause elementary because, you know,

578
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:58,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Pfizer cannot go to other districts to go look at instruction during the COVID climate.

579
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:12,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're looking at instruction, we had to pause the learning walks K-12 because you don't wanna have 10 additional administrators and staff traipsing into a classroom on top of six feet of distance.

580
01:04:13,003 --> 01:04:21,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were all of these things that really forced us to stop the necessary and important work that does need to happen.

581
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:49,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So by pausing it until June with the hopes that some people would be vaccinated by June, but to restart the elementary team so they could look at the different curricula that was gonna be before them and hopefully be able to conduct some observations next school year of other districts that either have a way of documenting that this is

582
01:04:50,774 --> 01:05:08,285
[SPEAKER_03]: better programming and the why behind it, so that if the time to do that in-depth work at the elementary level, we know whatever ends up being adopted, K-5 would be all set by 22, spring of 22 to come presented to school committee.

583
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at that point in time,

584
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:38,258
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Pfizer would be able to now focus all of our extra attention on secondary at the high school level and really say, where do we find or where have we identified additional gaps or areas for better curriculum to bring in at the high school level so that when we come up with this progression and have the catalog to say like, this is where we are and this is what is like,

585
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:41,561
[SPEAKER_03]: the top trend right now in mathematics.

586
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:49,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So you saw all of the different things that are being used at the secondary level, but there's a large course offering for the students.

587
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:57,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to reiterate that that's the intention of the work, and then to be able to continue

588
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:09,189
[SPEAKER_03]: with the mathematical learning walks, which school committee members and member Van der Kloot, some of them had had the opportunity to kind of come in and look for those core actions.

589
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:16,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did grow at K-12, but again, with these, you know, restrictions.

590
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:19,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So what member Rousseau just shared,

591
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:31,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we don't really know what's going to happen yet with the vaccine, but we're being very, very optimistic as a district, we do have to start thinking

592
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:55,457
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously thinking about next year, seriously thinking that if the vaccine truly isn't going to be available for the fall, you know, we need to start thinking about will we have remote learning academy 21, 22, you know, might be much smaller, but we need to start thinking about what instruction is going to look like.

593
01:06:56,057 --> 01:07:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, with restrictions and trying to find out about, um,

594
01:07:03,404 --> 01:07:11,609
[SPEAKER_03]: what's gonna happen with the virus, that will impact our ability to do the larger scale instructional learning walks.

595
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:24,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They can still happen, you know, myself, but right now the conditions under which, you know, the students are being taught where before they were working in groups, you could, you know, see the groups.

596
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have some online, some in a breakout room, some working independently, it's just, you know,

597
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,208
[SPEAKER_03]: we're just in this very, very difficult position.

598
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:55,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to state that, that it's not that we're not trying to focus deeply on instruction, but given the unusual circumstances of teaching and learning right now under these COVID conditions, we need to just keep that in mind, but we are very optimistic for 21, 22 school year that

599
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:05,057
[SPEAKER_03]: we will turn the corner at least, and at least be able to kind of get back to a greater sense of normalcy.

600
01:08:05,677 --> 01:08:09,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were my comments regarding what was said today.

601
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:10,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

602
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, do you see other hands up?

603
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if not, I've got some more questions.

604
01:08:15,602 --> 01:08:19,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, but there are a good number of community members here.

605
01:08:19,665 --> 01:08:23,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just didn't know if any of you had questions for Ms.

606
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Khan.

607
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just want to throw your hand in the air, we'd be happy to take them.

608
01:08:34,106 --> 01:08:40,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a couple of, I see a couple of the messages to me.

609
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:46,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you mind if I read them and answer those questions that have come in the messages?

610
01:08:46,936 --> 01:08:47,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, please do.

611
01:08:48,478 --> 01:08:48,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

612
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:55,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is from Christina McGordy and she says, how is the current version of TURK investigations?

613
01:08:56,066 --> 01:09:01,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know if this is or could be on the list based on my experience with it in 2000 to 2010.

614
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for leading this meeting.

615
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Christina, I tried to reply back.

616
01:09:07,972 --> 01:09:15,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like you are not here, but if anybody knows Christina, please do let her know that investigations three, version three is on our list.

617
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:18,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually one of the top ones that we are looking at.

618
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,682
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's very much in line with the philosophy, with the rubric.

619
01:09:24,523 --> 01:09:26,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if that helps.

620
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:36,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is from Lisa, is that I emailed you during the winter last year and I repeat my offer to assist with program reviews if I can help.

621
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:46,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a parent of an elementary student, remote third grade at a school and spent 25 years working in high school math publishing at HMH.

622
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:46,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked on,

623
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:52,138
[SPEAKER_01]: The editorial development of the geometry textbook currently being used at the high school.

624
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:54,359
[SPEAKER_01]: She sent me her email address.

625
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:54,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

626
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Lisa, I recall you.

627
01:09:56,921 --> 01:10:05,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been pleased with the current elementary program, though the reliance on the practice and problem solving workbook has meant minimal opportunity for practice.

628
01:10:05,626 --> 01:10:06,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay investigations.

629
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:07,588
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

630
01:10:07,628 --> 01:10:07,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So

631
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:09,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigations is on the list.

632
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:12,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

633
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:18,055
[SPEAKER_04]: The investigations people must have heard we were talking today, Faiza.

634
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:22,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigations is good and Newton uses it.

635
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think, I believe Brookline is also, was also going to adopt it.

636
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:29,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they did pilot the

637
01:10:30,964 --> 01:10:34,666
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha version of illustrative math at elementary level.

638
01:10:35,286 --> 01:10:45,792
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we need a little bit more stable program, the program that has been tested and tried enough and yet ties in with our middle school rigorous, you know, stronger program.

639
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:49,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, investigations is on the list just so everybody knows.

640
01:10:49,194 --> 01:10:49,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

641
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:53,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do include, we do plan to include parents.

642
01:10:53,636 --> 01:10:56,678
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we wanted to go gradual.

643
01:10:57,218 --> 01:11:04,343
[SPEAKER_01]: is that, you know, first the teachers look at it and see if it's, how does it look in the classroom to them?

644
01:11:04,663 --> 01:11:08,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there will definitely be some parents on the committee.

645
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:09,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

646
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:21,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to reduce the numbers because I'm very happy to see so much involvement, but you know, we, we'll probably have to pick one or two parents from each school, but definitely that's on the plan.

647
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:21,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

648
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:22,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

649
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:24,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ingrid has her hand up Ingrid.

650
01:11:27,254 --> 01:11:27,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hi.

651
01:11:27,915 --> 01:11:29,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Ingrid.

652
01:11:29,638 --> 01:11:30,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Amis.

653
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:44,565
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of talked about this already a little bit, but I just wanted to ask more details about what the process with the elementary, choosing an elementary curriculum was.

654
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:47,066
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point did you have to pause?

655
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:53,569
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the idea that you had already selected a few curriculums that you wanted to pilot this year.

656
01:11:53,589 --> 01:11:56,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's true, and I would like to know more about that.

657
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

658
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:02,047
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, Ingrid.

659
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:09,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so happy that you and I talked the other day and seemed like you have the similar background as I do.

660
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for being here and taking the time.

661
01:12:13,217 --> 01:12:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So the five programs that we were looking at is bridges was one of them.

662
01:12:19,642 --> 01:12:22,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And investigations is another one of them.

663
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:26,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Envisions 2020, of course, because there are previous publishers.

664
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, why not, right?

665
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:32,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we have to give everybody a fair chance.

666
01:12:32,187 --> 01:12:35,488
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not take it out because teachers are used to it.

667
01:12:35,548 --> 01:12:42,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to, you know, we want to make it a good mix, the whole end game.

668
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:47,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically our illustrative math was gonna be another one.

669
01:12:48,273 --> 01:12:50,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe there was another one.

670
01:12:51,055 --> 01:12:52,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I forgetting the name of it?

671
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:55,438
[SPEAKER_01]: But these were four out of the five.

672
01:12:55,558 --> 01:12:56,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And investigations, right?

673
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:03,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigations, bridges, illustrative math, and why am I forgetting?

674
01:13:03,824 --> 01:13:06,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, there are five of them.

675
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:07,346
[SPEAKER_01]: There were five of them.

676
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:09,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we were going to bring it down to three.

677
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:12,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we were going to bring it down to two with parents' help.

678
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:26,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were going to look at the cost and and and and then it's up to the up to we make the recommendation and the school committee is the one that You know,

679
01:13:28,714 --> 01:13:35,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process would be to select two and then you want to pilot two in the school?

680
01:13:35,782 --> 01:13:45,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we would ideally like to start piloting with three, but as time passes by, after three or four months, we would say these are our finalists, two of them.

681
01:13:46,274 --> 01:13:50,196
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how districts usually do it.

682
01:13:50,977 --> 01:13:52,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they choose two from the very beginning.

683
01:13:54,278 --> 01:14:05,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought three would not be a bad idea because we do have quite a few elementary schools and we want to do some populate throughout the grades.

684
01:14:05,864 --> 01:14:08,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So that no school gets left out.

685
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:13,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to keep in mind was that no one school, only one program.

686
01:14:13,588 --> 01:14:14,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of,

687
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:22,172
[SPEAKER_01]: all three programs at all different schools so that we get an idea of how our different populations are doing with it.

688
01:14:22,653 --> 01:14:28,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, choose one out of the final two and then final one.

689
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:41,461
[SPEAKER_01]: But we always do recommend two in the end because we have to keep, you know, certain factors in mind and it gives good competition.

690
01:14:42,002 --> 01:14:42,702
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.

691
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ms.

692
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:59,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Kahn, I know that some of the math curricula are increasingly reliant on technology, which probably when you did this initial view, our technology situation was considerably different than it is now.

693
01:15:00,805 --> 01:15:12,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there aren't that many silver linings in this pandemic, but being able to evaluate curricula

694
01:15:13,026 --> 01:15:17,032
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that we are a one-to-one device district.

695
01:15:18,354 --> 01:15:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that that sort of opens the doors for you all to really say,

696
01:15:24,447 --> 01:15:34,135
[SPEAKER_04]: this is what our students and teachers need and not feel constrained by like what we may or may not have right now.

697
01:15:34,255 --> 01:15:49,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So my request as you do that is that you don't rule anything out for any reason that if there are resources that are implicit in the success of a program that we just have a conversation about what those are but

698
01:15:51,103 --> 01:16:12,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like we did with the science curriculum with FOSS, you know, I sat in on some of those vendor interviews way back when, and there was definite concern about our district's ability slash willingness to like buy the consumables year over year.

699
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:18,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so glad that that did not get in the way of the choice that we made because by all accounts, like, you know,

700
01:16:19,935 --> 01:16:41,743
[SPEAKER_04]: the program is really strong, and I know it also is hampered by the pandemic, but I'm so glad that that concern, even though valid and historically accurate, did not get in the way of Mr. Seery coming forward and saying, this is the right curriculum for us, let's do this.

701
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:46,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would just encourage you not to be encumbered by,

702
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:53,512
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever thing may hold back a math curriculum, whatever that is.

703
01:16:54,592 --> 01:16:57,854
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a very good point and we'll definitely keep it in mind.

704
01:16:57,994 --> 01:17:06,657
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some teachers did voice it that what are going to be the restraints.

705
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:14,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, well, currently, you know, I should not use the word luckily, but COVID hit at a time right when we were

706
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,121
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to answer those questions.

707
01:17:17,161 --> 01:17:23,085
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of these five programs we chose based on one or the other.

708
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:37,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we went to ed reports, we went to the districts who were high performing as Dr. Vincent said, and that's where our programs came to us because we could learn from those districts firsthand what is working, what's not working.

709
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:53,627
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that was really important for us so that we are not reinventing the wheel, we are not, you know, wasting the educators time in piloting a program that we know is probably not coming highly recommended anyhow.

710
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:59,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see Ingrid's hand up, but I do see Lisa saying Singapore.

711
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Singapore math.

712
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,731
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, Lisa.

713
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:05,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you are recommending it.

714
01:18:06,451 --> 01:18:12,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure if Singapore math lines up with the Common Core.

715
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,154
[SPEAKER_01]: and with the Massachusetts frameworks.

716
01:18:15,254 --> 01:18:16,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to look into it.

717
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:24,656
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with certain programs out there, like Russian School of Mathematics and Kumon, they are great in a certain way.

718
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:33,998
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that they do not teach certain standards or teach certain standards in a different way than DESE wants us to.

719
01:18:34,178 --> 01:18:35,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are a public school system.

720
01:18:35,959 --> 01:18:37,059
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't forget that.

721
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:39,901
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we have to stay in line with DESI.

722
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if the program is wonderful and great, and it does not address the common core, we really should think about adopting it.

723
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:53,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question from Lisa, I hope Ingrid stays and doesn't go.

724
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:56,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it might be the fifth program.

725
01:18:56,473 --> 01:18:58,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it may not be possible.

726
01:18:59,075 --> 01:19:00,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we are happy to add six, but

727
01:19:01,677 --> 01:19:10,002
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sixth one, but again, most of our programs are coming from the ranking in ed reports.

728
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important because it's an independent agency that does it.

729
01:19:15,826 --> 01:19:20,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go to and look around which district is using what.

730
01:19:21,069 --> 01:19:24,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I recall the last one, the last program.

731
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:29,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just forgetting the name of it though, but I do exactly remember what it was.

732
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:30,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It was,

733
01:19:31,095 --> 01:19:36,640
[SPEAKER_01]: created by my teacher, my ex-teacher, who was a big proponent of this.

734
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:39,623
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by Curriculum Associates.

735
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:40,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm forgetting.

736
01:19:40,624 --> 01:19:41,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I forgetting the name?

737
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:42,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

738
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're just making me feel better today, Faiza.

739
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:50,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay for me to forget something.

740
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:52,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just forgetting the name of one.

741
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I can easily send it out.

742
01:19:55,456 --> 01:19:57,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll recall before the meeting is over.

743
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:58,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

744
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly in the middle of the night, you will pop up and say,

745
01:20:03,902 --> 01:20:05,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.

746
01:20:05,523 --> 01:20:15,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember one issue with the programs that we were having was definitely the amount of PD that was needed.

747
01:20:15,931 --> 01:20:27,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I'm in comfort zone with this, that I have this reassurance that we can look into programs without any hesitation, I'll be happy to look into it.

748
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

749
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a couple of questions, but except is Ingrid, did Ingrid have a follow-up?

750
01:20:36,225 --> 01:20:38,826
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just forgot to lower my hand.

751
01:20:40,147 --> 01:20:40,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ingrid.

752
01:20:41,608 --> 01:20:52,636
[SPEAKER_05]: The question I had was for, I was curious whether we had had any parent feedback on illustrative math so far, and also we had

753
01:20:55,038 --> 01:20:57,700
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about the professional development that was done.

754
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:10,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we have or how many new math teachers did we have into the system at the beginning of this year that needed to have professional development and was that completed?

755
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:17,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning of this year, we have had a few movements.

756
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:21,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not yet hired anybody from outside.

757
01:21:21,508 --> 01:21:27,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there were some movement from the high school to the middle school, actually just one teacher.

758
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:31,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teacher is very capable.

759
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:31,892
[SPEAKER_01]: He has

760
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:39,679
[SPEAKER_01]: dove right into it, doing extremely well at seventh grade level at Andrews.

761
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:46,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very pleased with the teams and the way they work and gel together.

762
01:21:46,384 --> 01:21:56,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great combination of experience and the newer ones bringing their energy and their technology skills.

763
01:21:56,913 --> 01:22:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing I'm experiencing.

764
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,158
[SPEAKER_01]: at the middle schools now.

765
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:06,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So only one teacher, and I feel like he's right up there with them.

766
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:13,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to, yesterday by chance I had a discussion with Molly Layden about the document cameras.

767
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:21,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like they're such a popular item right now, they're delayed for another month or two.

768
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:24,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, do some of the teachers have them?

769
01:22:26,163 --> 01:22:33,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so what we had done was about three or four years ago, we invested in document cameras.

770
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:39,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, all mathematics classrooms have document cameras.

771
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:46,087
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some that were provided as part of the grant, but only at Andrews Middle School.

772
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:47,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So we

773
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:56,510
[SPEAKER_01]: document cameras to everybody, and pretty much all teachers have them, and they are having good success rate with it.

774
01:22:57,731 --> 01:23:01,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like that's a good piece to invest in.

775
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:11,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I wanted to circle back to my colleague's discussion about creating a catalog.

776
01:23:11,965 --> 01:23:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Faiza, you seem like you're well on your way.

777
01:23:15,965 --> 01:23:22,227
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with the information you've presented us tonight, would it be appropriate, Superintendent, to ask Ms.

778
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:32,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Kahn to begin that piece of documenting for the mathematics curriculum, what we are calling a catalog?

779
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But Faiza, I think you heard some of the information that we want, and Jenny, if you could weigh in about other things that you had in mind, particularly for the creation of this document,

780
01:23:49,072 --> 01:24:03,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the big things are to make sure that where we can, that we're, because part of the motion talked about being able to post all this information on the website.

781
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sort of ties into some of the other things we've been talking about around like when kindergarten families are coming to like look at the district, what can they see?

782
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: What can they click?

783
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:14,612
[SPEAKER_04]: What can they, you know,

784
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to to get an understanding.

785
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:18,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's not just kindergarten.

786
01:24:18,357 --> 01:24:21,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, lots of different people would go looking for that kind of thing.

787
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:32,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, any information about The name of the program or textbook and and Pfizer, I can send you an email with these things in it.

788
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:33,596
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's helpful, but

789
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:44,647
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we purchased them, I think ultimately what I would envision is that it would have a column that says this is when we last reviewed this.

790
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:57,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to see us be able to sort of demonstrate to the community that we're reviewing this stuff on a regular basis, like whatever that policy is, which this subcommittee will have to circle around to at some point this year.

791
01:24:58,216 --> 01:25:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: but like what is our policy for curriculum review and like what what does that look like so that the school committee is getting and the community is getting some sort of regular feedback from you all saying we've reviewed this we're still happy with it or we've reviewed this and this needs to go up on the block for you know consideration next time around.

792
01:25:19,034 --> 01:25:28,641
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as, you know, like I said, any sort of link out to the resources that are available for people to either understand the curriculum or access things, right?

793
01:25:28,701 --> 01:25:31,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's online access, which obviously

794
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:37,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we wouldn't have cared so much about like a year and a half ago, but now it's really, really, really important.

795
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:48,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other things that we talked about in the motion, Paulette, was whether the curriculum has EL or IEP supplements.

796
01:25:49,155 --> 01:25:59,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we are using them, and if we're not, what are we doing instead to serve those populations of our students?

797
01:26:01,842 --> 01:26:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's even as applicable in math, Ms.

798
01:26:05,148 --> 01:26:09,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Kahn, or if it's more of an ELA type.

799
01:26:09,742 --> 01:26:10,463
[SPEAKER_04]: extension.

800
01:26:10,883 --> 01:26:17,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is, it is because we are big believers in core teaching and inclusiveness.

801
01:26:17,907 --> 01:26:21,169
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for us to have both of those pieces.

802
01:26:21,549 --> 01:26:21,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

803
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:35,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just not sure whether the, the textbook companies provided like purchasable extensions like that, um, in, in math in the same way that I know that they do on the ELA side.

804
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then,

805
01:26:41,675 --> 01:26:56,620
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, any sort of feedback about the expiration date of whatever the piece is, and if it's sort of a candidate for replacement, when are we sort of envisioning that happening so we can start to say,

806
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:59,766
[SPEAKER_04]: in math, this is what's coming.

807
01:26:59,786 --> 01:27:11,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the elementary level, like across subjects, this is what's coming because at the elementary level, like teachers don't have the bandwidth to absorb many, many new curricula at the same time.

808
01:27:11,472 --> 01:27:18,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Pfizer wants to do something, that means Dr. Chiesa can't, right?

809
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's just only so much time in the day to absorb new curriculum.

810
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: and do the proper amount of professional development.

811
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:36,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So just thinking through that at the elementary level, I feel like it looks very different than it does at the secondary level, but I think the same like chart structure would work.

812
01:27:37,773 --> 01:27:38,193
[SPEAKER_04]: cases.

813
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

814
01:27:39,694 --> 01:27:40,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

815
01:27:40,314 --> 01:27:48,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you send me the criteria, I'll make sure I create a sheet and you know, whatever information I have.

816
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:52,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be careful, though, because it's not the it's not the school committees.

817
01:27:52,837 --> 01:27:53,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to give you

818
01:27:55,498 --> 01:28:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: direction in whatever I so I had referred through the superintendent whether it would be possible given Wisconsin excellent report tonight if we went on and you know if you might have the discussion with her about taking this to the next step and beginning this process of creating the catalog and you know would seem like as we have these meetings that that's exactly what we should do as sort of after after each meeting is asking the department head

819
01:28:25,497 --> 01:28:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: to in fact create that kind of information that it would be a logical next step.

820
01:28:29,622 --> 01:28:31,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So Superintendent if you'd address that please.

821
01:28:32,286 --> 01:28:40,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I want to say great minds think alike and in preparation for today's meeting Ms.

822
01:28:40,677 --> 01:28:42,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Kahn when she was

823
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,681
[SPEAKER_03]: setting it up.

824
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:53,869
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of hyperlinks embedded within the slide deck to the frameworks and to, at the high school level, what the course descriptions are.

825
01:28:54,529 --> 01:29:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were some elements of that added to this particular presentation.

826
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:07,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we actually wanted to replicate, you know, I was waiting to see how today's meeting went.

827
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,901
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the types of questions?

828
01:29:08,981 --> 01:29:10,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Were we able to anticipate

829
01:29:12,364 --> 01:29:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: and respond to questions that people had.

830
01:29:14,565 --> 01:29:20,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was taking notes on the other areas that we missed the mark and didn't hit yet.

831
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:29,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the course catalog, I did write down those pieces about the review date, what's the actual program, where Ms.

832
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:34,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Kahn had listed all the programs at the different grade levels, the expiration date.

833
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:38,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And from an equity lens, I really feel it's

834
01:29:39,352 --> 01:29:56,062
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, an excellent display that we are committed to meeting the needs of our students with disabilities and our English learners by saying, moving forward when we're adopting new curriculum, is this something they take into consideration?

835
01:29:57,022 --> 01:30:06,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Some companies may not, but there are supplemental curricula such as like NewZella, which it supplements

836
01:30:07,648 --> 01:30:11,310
[SPEAKER_03]: by humanities programming and they use it in EL programming.

837
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like we get a two for one out of it.

838
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:26,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there were to be a program that was selected that might not specifically call it out, then we could find something that would supplement it to meet that need.

839
01:30:27,256 --> 01:30:31,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just, you know, taking my own notes and saying that this could be.

840
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ways that we're showing that we're truly trying to meet the needs of our entire community.

841
01:30:38,772 --> 01:31:03,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting, since we started with mathematics and we want to go through all of the other content areas to be able to follow a very similar format so that as the department heads and directors are presenting their respective departments, they'll be able to say, these are the programs at the respective grade levels and kind of give us the,

842
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:22,846
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we started, you know, it was adopted in this year and tentative expiration date is, you know, this year or the following year, because it does end up having indirect budgeting implications if we're just paying to extend to extend.

843
01:31:23,507 --> 01:31:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to have all of that in one area.

844
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that we definitely

845
01:31:29,973 --> 01:31:47,944
[SPEAKER_03]: will be able to do between now and by the time we, you know, as each department presents, we'll be able to at least start addressing those five areas so that the curriculum subcommittee can hear it in preparation for going into our next budget season.

846
01:31:48,822 --> 01:31:50,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer and then Jenny.

847
01:31:50,824 --> 01:31:51,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

848
01:31:51,565 --> 01:31:52,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Just two things.

849
01:31:52,426 --> 01:32:00,315
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, that support for English language learners, English learners and special education students.

850
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:02,918
[SPEAKER_01]: That is part of our rubric.

851
01:32:03,038 --> 01:32:07,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at the programs from that lens continuously.

852
01:32:08,763 --> 01:32:11,064
[SPEAKER_01]: not just from a general education perspective.

853
01:32:11,424 --> 01:32:12,985
[SPEAKER_01]: They are our students.

854
01:32:13,285 --> 01:32:14,926
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure we include them.

855
01:32:15,006 --> 01:32:16,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was in our rubric.

856
01:32:17,026 --> 01:32:23,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been in our rubric to look at the new programs at elementary schools.

857
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:31,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And two people reminded me of the name of the program, Michelle Sicolo and Ingrid Moncada.

858
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:32,452
[SPEAKER_01]: They both said, Ms.

859
01:32:32,472 --> 01:32:34,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Khan, is it ready classroom?

860
01:32:34,153 --> 01:32:34,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

861
01:32:34,933 --> 01:32:35,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

862
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:37,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

863
01:32:37,795 --> 01:32:38,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

864
01:32:38,735 --> 01:32:39,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

865
01:32:39,976 --> 01:32:40,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jenny.

866
01:32:42,137 --> 01:32:56,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Edouard-Vincent, I was thinking about this presentation as it was going sort of envisioning that you would sort of looking for a model to repeat as we go through all the different catalog, the catalog areas.

867
01:32:57,127 --> 01:33:00,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I think, you know,

868
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this is, you know, I'm sensitive to how much work this is for the departments to put together so I think one piece of feedback I would have is, I don't need as much sort of history about how we align to common core and there's Jesse and frameworks like

869
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:33,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's a common story, which maybe we should tell once or maybe in a summary, but I just don't want all the department heads spending time crafting the history side of things, because I know they just have a lot of other things to do.

870
01:33:35,014 --> 01:33:36,935
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did really appreciate

871
01:33:38,544 --> 01:33:44,547
[SPEAKER_04]: the sort of comments about where we are, what we're looking at in the right now time.

872
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe it, you know, in my head, it's like, it's that plus the actual catalog.

873
01:33:54,911 --> 01:34:00,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're sort of covering a lot of bases with that preparation.

874
01:34:00,413 --> 01:34:03,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that gets to be like a lighter lift for the team.

875
01:34:03,414 --> 01:34:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

876
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:18,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely, I don't personally want people spending lots and lots of time crafting slides about history because I think I want us to be able to focus on like, where are we right now and how do we move forward?

877
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just my input.

878
01:34:20,842 --> 01:34:23,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely make that adjustment.

879
01:34:23,144 --> 01:34:33,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the one reason why for both humanities and for social studies and for math, because Desi was sending out

880
01:34:34,673 --> 01:34:35,674
[SPEAKER_03]: different revisions.

881
01:34:35,814 --> 01:34:44,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted people to realize it wasn't like a 1985, that it was fairly recent.

882
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And she wanted to just show like the shift to rigor, the triangle, the pyramid that everyone could understand.

883
01:34:52,525 --> 01:34:55,527
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the shift in mathematics is taking place right now.

884
01:34:56,407 --> 01:35:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: and why we shifted to illustrative math and the thinking behind what needed to shift at the elementary levels.

885
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:09,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some of the other content areas where we know we just purchased, for example, fast science.

886
01:35:10,417 --> 01:35:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of those pieces will be able to say, well, we adopted it in 2018 or 2019.

887
01:35:17,862 --> 01:35:39,050
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's good for five years, so we can definitely make that adjustment, not focus on the history, say where the department is right now, and describe the catalog offerings from K elementary, middle, and high, and get to as many of the expiration dates and

888
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:42,872
[SPEAKER_03]: when we need to think about curriculum renewal.

889
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:47,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can definitely make that modification moving forward for the other departments.

890
01:35:48,315 --> 01:36:02,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's great to have a nice to have, but like, maybe not in the like need to have category for the other departments, you know, I mean, like, I think in a perfect world, yeah, you'd have all of those things in one handy place.

891
01:36:02,225 --> 01:36:02,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But

892
01:36:03,045 --> 01:36:16,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if the department heads are pressed for time, and I just sort of assume everyone is, and we're trying to squeeze it all in, I feel like that's a really reasonable compromise in the right now.

893
01:36:17,054 --> 01:36:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so speaking of squeezing it all in, our next meeting is going to concentrate in January on foreign languages and technology.

894
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:30,919
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to get to foreign language because we had raised some questions about that.

895
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:36,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And technology was also in, it's gonna be a lot.

896
01:36:36,283 --> 01:36:40,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might certainly schedule it for a two hour block.

897
01:36:41,847 --> 01:36:44,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have time to devote to each area.

898
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,533
[SPEAKER_05]: February was supposed to be science.

899
01:36:49,113 --> 01:36:50,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And then March was,

900
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:52,726
[SPEAKER_05]: English language arts.

901
01:36:53,867 --> 01:36:57,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Jenny, you had asked whether ELA could come sooner.

902
01:36:58,552 --> 01:37:02,616
[SPEAKER_05]: The superintendent, I'm not sure if you had the chance to have that discussion with Dr. Chiesa.

903
01:37:03,136 --> 01:37:06,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I will.

904
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:12,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there was, she wanted additional time to continue so that she felt by March

905
01:37:12,765 --> 01:37:16,287
[SPEAKER_03]: she would be prepared with new data to be able to present that.

906
01:37:16,887 --> 01:37:26,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I can have a little bit of time to just continue to work with her to see if we need to relocate, switch science and ELA.

907
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:30,374
[SPEAKER_03]: But she was hoping to have the time to be able to make

908
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:35,113
[SPEAKER_03]: stronger recommendations by the time her March presentation came.

909
01:37:35,653 --> 01:37:37,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will follow up with her.

910
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be able to report out on that at our January meeting or prior to the January meeting to say which way we could go.

911
01:37:44,295 --> 01:37:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the world language and technology where we've presented a lot of what we've done with technology this year, especially with the significant investments that we made.

912
01:37:55,757 --> 01:38:00,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was thinking kind of to have an overview of the investments that we have made in technology

913
01:38:01,658 --> 01:38:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so I was trying to think a little differently about it as a course offering, but also, you know, to give world language the time that it needs so that we can just look at where are we with, you know, world languages and what are we using in those particular areas.

914
01:38:23,335 --> 01:38:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will, you know, make it work.

915
01:38:27,852 --> 01:38:31,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can do a longer meeting if that.

916
01:38:33,378 --> 01:38:34,918
[SPEAKER_03]: is necessary.

917
01:38:35,438 --> 01:38:47,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to say at the beginning of the meeting, I was flustered enough with my technology snafus that I didn't announce that the members of the subcommittee are myself and Jenny Graham.

918
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Mia couldn't make it, but Paul Rousseau was in attendance tonight.

919
01:38:53,141 --> 01:38:56,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So we appreciate that he was here as well.

920
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:00,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, do you have any further thoughts before we wrap this meeting up?

921
01:39:02,615 --> 01:39:14,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I think this was really helpful and I think this will be a really good framework to use as we go through this process, and I think it will be particularly helpful at budget time when.

922
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:19,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it just will help us sort of eliminate surprises of.

923
01:39:20,778 --> 01:39:25,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have five textbooks this year that we have to plan and budget for and all that good stuff.

924
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this was great.

925
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

926
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ms.

927
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:30,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Kahn, I would particularly like to thank you for your presentation.

928
01:39:31,922 --> 01:39:33,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always enjoyed when you're here.

929
01:39:33,502 --> 01:39:34,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.

930
01:39:34,603 --> 01:39:35,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Paulette?

931
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:37,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Paul.

932
01:39:38,124 --> 01:39:38,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

933
01:39:38,684 --> 01:39:47,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to add, I'm really excited by this curriculum roadmap or whatever it will be called or is called because I think that

934
01:39:48,398 --> 01:40:04,185
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the things that none of us, of the school committee, and obviously the educators don't want it either, is to, you know, wait for a parent to knock on our door or send an email saying, hey, we're teaching kids from a 1987 psychology textbook, what the hell?

935
01:40:05,486 --> 01:40:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, you know, once we have everything on a map, then the school committee can actually pass a policy saying, we're gonna take things in order, not based on who's making the loudest noise at that moment in time.

936
01:40:17,696 --> 01:40:21,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can put this to bed as an actual problem to solve.

937
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:35,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there will always be situations where, you know, a curriculum has to change out of order because of the state's frameworks or because somebody releases something truly, you know, innovative that everybody wants to get on.

938
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:44,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to wait five years from now, but being able to have everything on a map that all the stones have been turned over and we can say,

939
01:40:45,233 --> 01:40:56,159
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what, this is the policy of the school committee that, you know, when a textbook is expired or that that's the one that will get renewed next year, I think is really important.

940
01:40:56,839 --> 01:40:58,260
[SPEAKER_02]: But as Fiza, Ms.

941
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:07,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Khan mentioned, you know, sometimes the textbooks can get very old and still be the best option, which is, we could always hope for that to be the case for a lot of things.

942
01:41:08,425 --> 01:41:09,425

01:41:11,827 --> 01:41:13,668

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I have a motion to adjourn.

948
01:41:20,455 --> 01:41:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Paulette, you're on mute.
