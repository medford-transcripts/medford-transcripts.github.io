[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

41
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,730

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

43
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:44,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

44
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:45,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

45
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello.

46
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

47
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:49,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

48
00:02:49,576 --> 00:03:06,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Public participation will be for a synopsis of the myth of the Community Preservation Committee discussion on the Thomas Brooks Master Implementation Plan Phase One.

49
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:14,605
[SPEAKER_13]: In 2019, the Method Historical Commission was awarded a $25,000 grant to develop a master plan for the Thomas Brooks Park.

50
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:21,286
[SPEAKER_13]: The master plan is now complete and the Method Historical Commission is applying for phase one of the implementation.

51
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:35,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the recommendations from the landscape architect, the Method Historical Committee is proposing phase one to include, one, slave wall restoration, two, ecological dig, three, rebuild of the field stone wall on Grove Street,

52
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:42,055
[SPEAKER_13]: and edging cleanup and removal of invasive species along the field stone wall.

53
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:50,637
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Jennifer Keenan in attendance to give us a synopsis of this plan.

54
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Jennifer, are you here?

55
00:03:52,926 --> 00:04:00,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, actually, Jennifer Keenan was not able to continue into the regular council session.

56
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:02,414
[SPEAKER_08]: She had a hard stop at seven o'clock.

57
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:10,421
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we have Doug Carr, also from the Historical Commission, who can continue to answer questions about this project.

58
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:15,445
[SPEAKER_08]: He is at the phone number 781-526-7405 that's on this call, so he would need to be unmuted.

59
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the clerk will unmute him.

60
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Carr, are you on the call?

61
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I am on the call.

62
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

63
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, Medford.

64
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:35,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a member of the Medford Historical Commission.

65
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:37,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Carr.

66
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:44,154
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could give us a brief synopsis of the Thomas Brooks Master Plan Implementation Phase Two.

67
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:44,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

68
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Jen was the driving force behind this, but the entire historic commission was behind it as well.

69
00:04:53,211 --> 00:05:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: As you alluded to earlier, we had a $25,000 grant due to a master plan to look at the entire fossil land.

70
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, we took the three most important and prominent items, and that is the restoration of the slave wall.

71
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Grove Street Stonewall and the archeological dig for what was the Thomas Brooks house that was previously there before the...

72
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,872
[SPEAKER_04]: before the premier arena was built many, many years ago.

73
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the three items, adding up to $300,000.

74
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, this will be publicly bid, as all projects like this would be.

75
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:39,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got those numbers from our landscape architect, and we had stonewall numbers from the end belt stonewall project that this council approved a couple of years ago.

76
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are pretty accurate numbers in terms of the bidding.

77
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President?

78
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions?

79
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Would the gentleman be so kind, Mr. President, to explain to us how much of that $300,000 is for the architectural dig services?

80
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:14,186
[SPEAKER_04]: The breakdown of the 300,000 is 50,000 for the restoration of the grave wall, 50,000 for the archeological dig, and 200,000 for the stone wall, which is quite long.

81
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:17,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the exact length, but it's very long.

82
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at least 1,000 feet.

83
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:27,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a unit pricing that's fresh from that that we've used on the other parts of the state right down the road to justify those numbers.

84
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:42,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, the other question I do have is, is there any documentation that the council can review concerning the parcel that was on that property?

85
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:52,938
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my understanding that there was a home that might've been located there and that there was a consultant that was hired that did some type of review or study and reported that there

86
00:06:54,853 --> 00:07:01,254
[SPEAKER_15]: of the opinion there may be artifacts there, and I'm wondering if the council can get a report, take a look at the report at some point in time.

87
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:01,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

88
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:17,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have historic drawings of that house that was there until it was torn down before the Thomas Cook Park land was donated to the city of Medford as a public park in the early part of the 20th century, so we could provide that information to the council.

89
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, Councilman Wright.

90
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,823
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, when they talk about artifacts, what type of artifacts would come out of a location like this?

91
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:31,346
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it was the Brooks setup, that was like vacation homes for the Brooks family, if I'm not mistaken.

92
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:36,970
[SPEAKER_15]: What type of artifacts would you expect to find or consider finding if you did such type work?

93
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a very good question.

94
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually not a vacation home.

95
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,853
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually the working farm of Thomas Brooks at the time.

96
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:53,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, this is an 18th century house, so it's not quite as old as the royal house, but it's in the same century.

97
00:07:53,336 --> 00:08:00,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're anticipating finding potential items related to slavery and farming in the 18th century, among other things.

98
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know until you put shovel to dirt what you're going to find, obviously.

99
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct, which would lead me to my next question.

100
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:13,412
[SPEAKER_15]: If they did find something, would there be a request for further or future appropriation relative to further or future excavation of the site?

101
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:14,994
[SPEAKER_15]: If something was found, would this $50,000 cover everything?

102
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna go as far as we can take it.

103
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,352
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have any plans to do another dig.

104
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:25,073
[SPEAKER_04]: If it did, we'd have to try to look for funding elsewhere.

105
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:31,555
[SPEAKER_04]: We have other pieces of the master plan that we'd want to fund first at all times than what we find.

106
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm afraid it's an open-ended question, but we're not planning beyond the $50,000 for the dig.

107
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:39,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. Carr.

108
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Felder, you're welcome.

109
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

110
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Carr, for being here tonight.

111
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,282
[SPEAKER_01]: A question for you, do you know how

112
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:52,791
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the archaeological dig goes, which seems very interesting.

113
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:58,220
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering, do you know what size they're going to dig?

114
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a certain amount of square feet?

115
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how do they do that?

116
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the details, unfortunately.

117
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:12,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to provide you with the information that we got from the recommendation of the archaeologists and the people who know much more about it than I do.

118
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,867
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know we did something similar.

119
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't us.

120
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:19,130
[SPEAKER_04]: The Royal House did something very similar about 10 years ago, if you remember.

121
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,951
[SPEAKER_04]: They found an incredible amount.

122
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's under a glass case, the Royal House, that's there to this day.

123
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:26,475
[SPEAKER_04]: There are pieces of charred pottery.

124
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:31,157
[SPEAKER_04]: There are pieces from the period of slavery, obviously, outside between the two houses.

125
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really something that I'll have to get you more information.

126
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have that at my fingertips right at this time.

127
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:39,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

128
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,022
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could get us any additional information, that would be greatly appreciated.

129
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another question with regard to the artifacts.

130
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,085
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find artifacts, I assume they're going to find some artifacts, what would happen to those artifacts?

131
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they go to the historical society?

132
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they go to the library?

133
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any thought as to where those would go?

134
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would own those?

135
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:14,093
[SPEAKER_04]: The only two places I can see are the Historical Society and the New Methodist History Room and the New Methodist Public Library are the only two candidates that I can think of that would take those artifacts.

136
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,037
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be my recommendation, sir.

137
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:21,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was thinking as well, that it would go to one of those two spots.

138
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:34,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can make it as part of the committee to report that they either go to the Historical Society or the New History Room within the Medford Public Library.

139
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:45,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other question is, if these funds are approved, when do you foresee the work beginning with regard to the archaeological dig and the work on the

140
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,211
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grove Street Wall and the Slave Wall.

141
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:55,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all three of them should begin this calendar year.

142
00:10:55,774 --> 00:11:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take a couple of, I think, you know, a few months to get the procurement in place, but it should happen.

143
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,798
[SPEAKER_04]: All three projects should be started this calendar year is my understanding.

144
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:11,280
[SPEAKER_01]: This calendar year, do you know specifically, would it be around the summertime or?

145
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably late summer or in the fall, depending on, you know, the stonewall can actually be done.

146
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the Brook State stonewall through the part of the winter for the first two basins, so that has more flexibility than it does, obviously.

147
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And the slave wall must be done in warm weather for obvious reasons, because of the water.

148
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:35,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do anything below 40 degrees for any kind of masonry restoration.

149
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:37,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you, Mr. Carr.

150
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarborough.

151
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:40,599
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

152
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,500
Thank you, again.

153
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,920
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

154
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, thank you, Mr. President.

155
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Carr, for all your hard work.

156
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:52,416
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that you're involved in so many worthwhile endeavors in our community, so thank you.

157
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:56,918
[SPEAKER_12]: But my questions were very similar to what my colleagues have said.

158
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:06,604
[SPEAKER_12]: But to look further into the archeological dig and that request, I know we requested more information.

159
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:17,241
[SPEAKER_12]: The question's really to Roberta, if we would ask to just separate that $50,000 until we get a little more information.

160
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:24,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And just approve $250,000 to get the work started and the process started on the walls.

161
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:25,908
[SPEAKER_12]: One, is that possible?

162
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,733
[SPEAKER_12]: How much would that hinder the archaeological process?

163
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:43,837
[SPEAKER_12]: But the only reason why I think it's so important, I know Mr. Kyle said that all we're asking is for $50,000 and that's great, but we got to.

164
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:56,884
[SPEAKER_12]: We could be pretty exciting when you think of we start digging a little bit deeper and we find something really important to our history and we need more to keep moving forward with that.

165
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:59,847
[SPEAKER_12]: So really my question is to Roberta to see

166
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:14,300
[SPEAKER_12]: A, if we can just sever the $50,000 until we get more information dictating what that process is when we talk about archeological digs.

167
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And second, if there's a process that as we move forward,

168
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:27,733
[SPEAKER_12]: with the CPC looking into adding more funding if they do find something of value that we need to move forward with.

169
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's probably my question that needs to be answered tonight for that.

170
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Roberta, can you answer that question?

171
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:35,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

172
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:47,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So to answer the first part of the question, it is the council's prerogative to approve funding for up to the amount that the CPC has recommended.

173
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:55,582
[SPEAKER_08]: The funding cannot be spent without first being recommended by the CPC and then approved by the council.

174
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:58,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and any expansion of the program

175
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:07,231
[SPEAKER_08]: would have to come through the CPC to recommend an expansion of the archeological dig before the council could approve additional funds.

176
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:15,636
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I would, the other part of the question is whether it would hinder the process of carrying out the dig.

177
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:22,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't speak to the timing of when the archeological dig would need to take place.

178
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:26,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I can speak to the fact that there is a lead time for the,

179
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:42,509
[SPEAKER_08]: for the grant agreement to be processed and put into place and for the funds to be made available between the time that the council votes to approve the funds and when the funds can actually be available for the project.

180
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:52,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's slowing down that process, but indeed jeopardize the ability to get, make those funds available for this to continue.

181
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:56,826
[SPEAKER_08]: take place this calendar year, it could potentially be pushed into next calendar year.

182
00:14:57,427 --> 00:15:20,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to maybe suggest an alternative that the council could approve funding with conditions in place that the project be more fully identified and presented before the funding could be released for that portion of the project.

183
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:32,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also wanted to point out that the full plan that was prepared by the historical commission with the first phase of funding for this project is available.

184
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:47,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't happen to recall offhand, maybe Doug has more familiarity, the extent of detail of the archeological portion of the project that was identified in the plan that they prepared.

185
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,721
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so I appreciate that.

186
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,981
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be a good recommendation.

187
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:56,363
[SPEAKER_12]: But it wouldn't hinder the process.

188
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:09,810
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my points is if we wanted to move forward with the walls, is that something that couldn't be moved forward if we delayed or looked into more in depth the archaeological piece?

189
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is that all in one?

190
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:14,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make sense?

191
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,702
[SPEAKER_08]: You can fund a portion of the project.

192
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,763
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not funding, Roberta.

193
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:37,650
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm asking is, does one process of the building of the wall, let's say they can't do the wall until the archaeological piece is done, that's what I'm trying to get at.

194
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Would one delay the other?

195
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:45,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have to defer to Doug about the ability to

196
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,491
[SPEAKER_08]: adjust the timing of the project.

197
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree with what Roberto said earlier.

198
00:16:55,051 --> 00:17:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be concerned because it's definitely a summer gig, most likely.

199
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a while to get geared up.

200
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:06,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes probably a few months to actually do the gig.

201
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be concerned about it being delayed.

202
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: If something important is found there, there's nothing to prevent the CPC from trying to approve a grant on an ad hoc basis or try to

203
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,612
[SPEAKER_04]: insert more funds to adjust that, or find a different source of funding.

204
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:37,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But most likely, we're going to be just living within the $50,000 for this round, because that's what the plan will call for, and that's how the archaeological dig will be set up.

205
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,482
[SPEAKER_04]: If they find something else, they can always come back for a phase two.

206
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:45,765
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a one bite at the apple situation, in my opinion.

207
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,247
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so if we wanted more information,

208
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:54,609
[SPEAKER_12]: on the archaeological dig and get more depth about the $50,000 requested for this.

209
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Would this, the question is, would it delay the process of the refurbishing of the walls?

210
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,053
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

211
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

212
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:08,715
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's three different pieces that are going to be bid separately because there's three different contractors.

213
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:09,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

214
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:11,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

215
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,357
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

216
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:12,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

217
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:15,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

218
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,457
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you, Doug and Jennifer and the whole historical commission.

219
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,680
[SPEAKER_17]: My question is reading through the application.

220
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:31,404
[SPEAKER_17]: It mentions that access to Palm's wall is difficult due to shrubbery and overgrowth.

221
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:36,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Would part of this project be addressing access to Palm's wall from inside the park?

222
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:47,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's what I'm asking Council Member is an excellent question because to actually read the practice there now, you almost have to stand in Grove Street.

223
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:50,177
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not a well thought out concept.

224
00:18:50,217 --> 00:19:00,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would be trying to create some clearing on the wall on the inside, make sure it's an accessible path there from the neighborhood to the surrounding area and along Grove Street.

225
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:07,326
[SPEAKER_04]: so that anybody, including anyone in a wheelchair, could access that space and experience the wall.

226
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:12,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And we probably put the plaque so it's on the inside of the wall, so people could see it safely.

227
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:14,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

228
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Doug.

229
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,553
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just, again, I think this is a really important project.

230
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:25,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I can remember in third grade, down at the Hervey School, this was one of the, you know, the Pomp's Wall was one of the locations that

231
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:32,178
[SPEAKER_17]: our intrepid third grade students were assigned to take a video about and talk about.

232
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:35,380
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, it's really important that people can access it.

233
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really encouraged by this.

234
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:43,325
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the archeological dig goes forward and you find any gold or gemstones, I hope you'll let the city know.

235
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:44,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

236
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:45,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knox.

237
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

238
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Regarding the stone wall itself, will the $200,000 cover the entire length of the wall, Doug?

239
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is the way it's priced, correct.

240
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't anticipate coming back for any additional money for the wall itself?

241
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:09,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not.

242
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:11,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Not based on the unit pricing that we have and the length of the wall.

243
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,041
[SPEAKER_11]: My second question is Thomas Brooks Park.

244
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:20,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that fall under the jurisdiction of the Method Parks Commission?

245
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe so, but I'm not 100% sure.

246
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta, do you know?

247
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,012
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

248
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Carson, he was unsure.

249
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,034
[SPEAKER_13]: He's asking Roberta.

250
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:39,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, I believe it falls under the jurisdiction of the Parks Commission.

251
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:44,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So did we get authorization to do a dig on parkland?

252
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Roberta, did we get authorization to dig on park lands?

253
00:20:53,552 --> 00:21:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been, I can't, I don't know if Alicia might be able to speak more to the coordination with city staff on this project.

254
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:11,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

255
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia, are you still on the call?

256
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

257
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:18,913
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Alicia Hunt, the community development environment director.

258
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:23,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my I'm concerned.

259
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm nervous about speaking for the parks board.

260
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:38,144
[SPEAKER_09]: My impression has been that they tend to work with the rules and the allocation of fields for field space.

261
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:39,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

262
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:50,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm aware that the Parks Board actually has a seat on the Community Preservation Commission, but it hasn't been filled for a while.

263
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:56,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would expect it to be represented through that.

264
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:03,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I do believe that if this parcel of land is dedicated park land, then it would fall into the control and jurisdiction of the Parks Commission.

265
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:09,512
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's a park, and that's what the Park Commission is there for, to govern parks.

266
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:12,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so that's why, Mr. President, I asked the question.

267
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:19,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question is, if this is under the jurisdiction of the Medford Park Commission,

268
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:25,868
[SPEAKER_11]: then they really should give the authority to do digging, Mr. President.

269
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:38,037
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not saying that's not going to be a given, but before we release any money, that should be something that, Mr. President, should be done before the request for money to start digging takes place.

270
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,298
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to make that a form of amendment?

271
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, absolutely, Mr. President.

272
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,140
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want to make that a form of amendment?

273
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,844
[SPEAKER_13]: that the CPC contact the park board before doing any digging?

274
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:52,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they have to find out if it's under their jurisdiction.

275
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:59,430
[SPEAKER_11]: If not their jurisdiction, then they would have to contact the administration or the building commissioner or whoever else.

276
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:10,121
[SPEAKER_11]: would be responsible for city-owned property, maybe the city solicitor, and find out what avenues that have to address in order to do digging, Mr. President.

277
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:15,646
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would highly recommend that that take place, Mr. President, in order to move this forward.

278
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:17,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

279
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:28,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I would recommend with Roberta's recommendation that we move forward with the other two pieces.

280
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:41,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And then look into the questions that were brought up by Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks.

281
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:46,332
[SPEAKER_12]: And then so we could still, that money will still be there once we have those questions answered.

282
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:49,432
[SPEAKER_12]: We can move approval on those when the time comes.

283
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,593
[SPEAKER_12]: So like I said, it's not,

284
00:23:52,633 --> 00:24:02,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to not vote against it, but I want to make sure that we have the questions answered that we can't have answered tonight, but we move forward with the other two pieces of this very important project.

285
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:02,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

286
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

287
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

288
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:15,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just looking at, you know, we're operating as if we're still in committee, I guess at this point, we're just reporting, making recommendations out of committee.

289
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:19,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do still have until this appears on our regular agenda to vote.

290
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: We have that time in between, correct?

291
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:28,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that we'll get everything we need between them, but I'm just saying for the time being.

292
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:37,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this was not on the agenda this evening, we really can't vote on it, so it will be on next week's agenda for a final vote.

293
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

294
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:42,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm saying is we may have time to get that information.

295
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,899
[SPEAKER_13]: If everybody can get the answer to the questions for next week, that'd be appreciated.

296
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I believe that's what we're doing.

297
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:51,244
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we're here.

298
00:24:51,264 --> 00:25:01,513
[SPEAKER_12]: We're giving them the recommendations to get that information in order so we can move favorably during our regular session when it comes for voting.

299
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:01,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

300
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, yeah, which I was just clarifying.

301
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:12,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just some of the language, I think, may have been confusing just again, because we do still have time to vote fully when this comes on the regular agenda.

302
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:13,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just clarifying that.

303
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

304
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:14,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Morocco.

305
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:16,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on this?

306
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:28,958
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve the money for the... That's right, we can't approve this.

307
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,600
[SPEAKER_13]: On the recommendation,

308
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:58,385
[SPEAKER_13]: on the Thomas Brooks Park Master Plan Information Phase One, as amended by Councilor Falco, that the artifacts go into the new Method Public Library History Room, and as amended by Councilor Marks, that the CPT contact the park board before doing any digging to make sure that whose jurisdiction this falls under.

309
00:25:59,146 --> 00:25:59,566
[SPEAKER_01]: My correct?

310
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:12,992
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, my amendment was to, that either go, the artifacts either go to the Medford Public Library History Room or the Medford Historic Society.

311
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the Medford Historical Society.

312
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:15,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Either or.

313
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Either or.

314
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

315
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:21,076
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the motion and by.

316
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:24,577
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion and by.

317
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:26,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's gonna make the motion?

318
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, second and by.

319
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,625

President Caraviello?

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

335
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:53,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And the motion passes.

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

337

[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

338
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,770

339
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,592

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

341
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:13,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

342
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:14,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

343
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:15,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

344
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:16,253

347
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:18,353

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 70 affirmative, motion passes.

353
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

354
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:32,156
[SPEAKER_13]: 21014, authored by Vice President Knight, Councilor Marks, and Councilor Scarpelli.

355
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:46,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an update from Hallmark Health, Lawrence Memorial Hospital, which is the official name, relative to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital site.

356
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:49,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Knight.

357
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

358
00:27:52,832 --> 00:28:09,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Before the approval of the construction plans for the ambulatory surgical care center, this council engaged with our friends from Circle Health to conduct a series of monthly meetings to keep the neighborhood and the community informed as to the progress and status of that project.

359
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:24,783
[SPEAKER_15]: After the passage of the paperwork that was before this council, construction started, and we had made a commitment to the neighborhood and to this community that we would periodically have Circle Health back in before us to provide us with further and future updates.

360
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:28,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And this paper before us this evening is just that, Mr. President.

361
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:35,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd ask that we turn the floor over to the co-sponsors, and then after that, the representative from Hallmark Health, Mr. Trubilski.

362
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:36,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

363
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:38,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Marks, co-sponsor.

364
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:40,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

365
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:46,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for co-sponsoring this important resolution.

366
00:28:47,267 --> 00:29:01,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor and Vice President Knight in particular for keeping this on our agenda to make sure that along this entire process that our residents have been made aware of updates and what's going on on that particular site.

367
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:29,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I have just a few things to mention that I spoke about a couple weeks back when we talked about new signage that has been popping up in the Forest Street, Governor's Ave area, which was a combined effort between the city of Medford and the hospital to work on some safety concerns in the general vicinity, of which many of the improvements that have been made

368
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:36,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I think have really improved public safety and speeding in the area.

369
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:49,230
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I would like to mention, Mr. President, is I have been receiving a number of complaints, and I'm sure my fellow colleagues have also, regarding the speed hump at the top of Governor's Ave.

370
00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:12,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I recently reached out to the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, had a discussion about some of the signage, and some of the residents that live directly near this speed hump are concerned that it's not having the impact that you would think a speed hump would have, slowing down traffic in the area.

371
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:15,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not sure if it's the elevation

372
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:24,620
[SPEAKER_11]: that cars are just going over it without tapping their brake or slowing down, or the fact that it blends in with the street.

373
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:27,522
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a number of concerns, Mr. President.

374
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:39,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask, and I'm hoping to hear tonight from LMH, what possibly can be done, and maybe even our traffic engineer, to take a look at this speed hump.

375
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:50,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we want to make sure if we're putting traffic calming initiatives that they serve a purpose and not just to say we did something.

376
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:58,733
[SPEAKER_11]: And from what I'm hearing from area residents, that hump right now they don't believe is serving a purpose because of its location and proximity.

377
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:08,101
[SPEAKER_11]: to Saltwater Road and the proximity to the elevation of Governor's Ave, it's not really serving a purpose at all.

378
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:10,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that that be looked at, Mr. President.

379
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:18,790
[SPEAKER_11]: The second complaint, Mr. President, and I think the hospital is going to speak upon it and expand tonight regarding exterior lighting.

380
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:24,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the owners of 179 Governor's Ave have reached out to members of this council.

381
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:33,922
[SPEAKER_11]: concerned about some new lighting that I guess at night is shining in some of the residents across Governor's Ave into their windows.

382
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:46,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask that that exterior lighting be looked at, the lumens, the direction of the light, and see if we could put low lighting lights in their exterior lights.

383
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:53,755
[SPEAKER_11]: that won't cause the same impact to butters across the street on Governor Zav, in particular 179.

384
00:31:54,415 --> 00:32:04,040
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that LMH do a study on their lights and see what's happening with the lights outside, Mr. President.

385
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:33,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last point I want to make, and I spoke about it last week briefly, was the fact that we all received an email from community advisory group members, of which two of them sent a letter stating that they're resigning for a number of reasons from the community advisory group after giving a couple years of commitment on behalf of area residents to be the eyes and ears of area residents during this whole process.

386
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:49,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would just hope that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, who came up with the idea with creating this community advisory group, which I thought was a magnificent idea, continue their efforts to work with this group.

387
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,963
[SPEAKER_11]: to make sure that they feel part of the process and be given updates along the entire process, Mr. President.

388
00:32:56,404 --> 00:33:07,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that this is up and functioning, it's even more important now than when we were going through construction and everything else, because now we're going to hear from residents about a working facility.

389
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:18,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And the concern with parking, and traffic, and speeding, and signage, and noise, and everything associated with having a full-fledged ambulatory care facility in this location.

390
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:23,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's of the utmost importance that Lawrence Memorial keep with their commitment.

391
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:32,798
[SPEAKER_11]: to making sure that they involve the community advisory group as well as the entire city and anything that takes place there.

392
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:37,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just ask that that be part of their discussions, Mr. President, as well.

393
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to hear what has to be stated tonight.

394
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:41,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

395
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:42,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Beally.

396
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:44,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:48,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I have to thank my colleagues, Council Marks and Council Knight, especially.

398
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:53,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that Council Knight really spearheaded this in the onset of this project.

399
00:33:54,928 --> 00:34:03,571
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I won't repeat what they said, but I think my concern is that here we are ready to cross that goal line and

400
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:24,032
[SPEAKER_12]: the complaints from some of the neighbors that really we're not following through of all the hard work that was put forth from the representatives from LMH and this council and the advisory committee that made sure that all the concerns were addressed and they were listened to.

401
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:26,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Councilman Mark said,

402
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:34,361
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been difficult, I imagine, with the pandemic and having open meetings and getting everybody more involved like we had in the past.

403
00:34:34,421 --> 00:34:45,465
[SPEAKER_12]: But as things get to somewhat normalcy, and the nursing school reopens, and the parking concerns become an issue again, I think that that's important.

404
00:34:47,105 --> 00:35:09,123
[SPEAKER_12]: the neighbors in that area, especially that immediate area, have someone that's going to listen to them and make sure that this council did their due diligence and really follow through to make sure that it wasn't just an empty promise, but we're ready to follow through as we go through a pretty exciting process at the ambulatory center.

405
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:11,645
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'd be interesting to hear what

406
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:27,044
[SPEAKER_12]: what our representatives have to say and hopefully our residents can share some concerns or issues and get them rectified so we get the train back on its rails and make sure everybody's in the same place.

407
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:27,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

408
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

409
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,002
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on the agenda.

410
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:36,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and I just want to echo.

411
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:51,154
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the concerns that all three of them have raised, um, hearing from so many residents who have been so deeply involved in this process for several years and the council working with residents diligently to secure conditions that the neighborhood would be comfortable with.

412
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,695
[SPEAKER_17]: And now here we are kind of at the

413
00:35:53,635 --> 00:36:02,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the finish line of getting this open and now residents are feeling, I think, a little bit burned that what they have now is not what they expected.

414
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,722
[SPEAKER_17]: So I really hope we can address some of these immediate concerns.

415
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:14,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm also hopeful if our zoning recodification is approved, that there are some tools in there around Dover amendment and site plan review.

416
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:21,710
[SPEAKER_17]: that at least going forward, if there are any new proposals, we may have a little bit more, a few more tools in our toolbox to address this as well.

417
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:31,914
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you again to my fellow councilors, and I hope we can address these issues, especially, it was just shocking to hear about, you know, lights beaming into your house in the middle of the night.

418
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,095
[SPEAKER_17]: I really hope we can address that.

419
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:33,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

420
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:35,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Bailão.

421
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:35,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

422
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

423
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:40,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward as well.

424
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,952
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think back to when this process first started a while back and it got off to a rough start, but then

425
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:55,742
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a council, we really kind of worked with the hospital and the residents to bring this back on, as Councilor Scarpelli said, back on the rails.

426
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:57,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, we had monthly meetings.

427
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:01,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And those monthly meetings were well attended when we had people in the chambers.

428
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:07,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was good back and forth between the residents, the council, and the hospital.

429
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:09,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And that went really well.

430
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:24,579
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I can't thank enough the members of the CAG, the Community Advisory Group, for all the work that they did representing the neighborhood and for the councils for asking all of their great questions through the process.

431
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is sad to hear that, you know, maybe things have gone off the rails a little bit.

432
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:37,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think now more than ever, the hospital really needs to engage with the community

433
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:40,690
[SPEAKER_01]: with the community advisory group.

434
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:55,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's going to be a second iteration of that group, and there are going to be new members, I think it's important that there is a back and forth, and there is a constant dialogue between the hospital, between the community group, and between the council.

435
00:37:56,686 --> 00:38:01,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Now more than ever, when things, when the project is, you know,

436
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:04,458
[SPEAKER_01]: nearing its point of completion.

437
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:10,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're really, I think, going to start to see a lot of quality of life issues that impact that neighborhood on a daily basis.

438
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hospital needs to come to the table and communicate with that community advisory group and the council.

439
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:22,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really interested to hear and get an update tonight as to what's going on.

440
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:38,031
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, really believe that now more than ever, we need to make sure that the hospital is engaging with the residents to make sure that we can ensure a good quality of life up in that neighborhood when this comes to completion.

441
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:40,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

442
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:42,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

443
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:46,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan Fuller, will you be speaking for the hospital?

444
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:52,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, are you there?

445
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, I'm here.

446
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan, name and address of the record, please.

447
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:57,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

448
00:38:57,642 --> 00:39:00,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan Fuller, 170 Governors Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

449
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, everyone.

450
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:08,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Mr. President and honorable City Council members.

451
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:14,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pleased to be here tonight to provide you with some updates on the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Campus project.

452
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:17,315
[SPEAKER_03]: As I stated, my name is Ryan Fuller.

453
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Vice President of Strategy and Business Planning for Delrose-Basin Healthcare.

454
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It is nice to see all of you again, even virtually.

455
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss being in the chamber and I hope everyone is staying safe.

456
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:39,431
[SPEAKER_03]: As some of the councilors alluded to, our work continues to be challenging as we continue to address the daily demands of the ongoing COVID surge.

457
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: As many of you here tonight know, the numbers of the ongoing outbreak are staggering.

458
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:49,656
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, we have been experiencing COVID hospitalization volumes higher than we did last spring.

459
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:53,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are experiencing those volumes for longer periods.

460
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:04,509
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that follow the state's DPH report, you know that the Northeast region that we are in has especially been busy with percentages of bed capacity in the mid-90% at its most recent mark.

461
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:07,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That average is down slightly, which is great news.

462
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:13,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, we had about 87% in our region for the medical-surgical beds, and ICU beds were at 91%.

463
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:19,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an incredible amount of work going on at the hospital.

464
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:26,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Our staff has been truly amazing and has been heroic throughout this pandemic.

465
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,948
[SPEAKER_03]: This pandemic has almost been going on for a year.

466
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:35,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pandemic impacts our staff as well, at home and at work.

467
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:43,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So supporting the health and well-being of our staff has been an additional focus for us and the leadership at Melrose-Lakes Public Health.

468
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:48,725
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also began our vaccination efforts in accordance to the state's guidelines.

469
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:51,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It truly is a light at the end of the tunnel.

470
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:55,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all extremely excited about this next phase.

471
00:40:56,129 --> 00:41:02,152
[SPEAKER_03]: With about one week's notice in December, we implemented and operationalized our vaccine clinic that we had been planning on.

472
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:08,896
[SPEAKER_03]: But at a one-week green light notice, we began vaccinating our employees and staff.

473
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:12,018
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to manage that clinic, responding to the state's directives.

474
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:20,586
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, many of our colleagues on the phone with me tonight are working right now on our rollout plan for the phase two residents, which the governor announced yesterday.

475
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:25,671
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing this work while also challenged with the inconsistent vaccine deliveries.

476
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,915
[SPEAKER_03]: All will continue to deliver non-COVID care and emergent care in the hospital.

477
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:38,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We've deferred some cases, but that's really to reallocate staff to the COVID units, but the vast majority of the services have continued.

478
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:44,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's at the Lois Memorial Outpatient Center and at the Bellagio Hospital.

479
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:58,760
[SPEAKER_03]: At Lois Memorial Hospital specifically, the campaigns during this time, as you know, has become a key testing site, as well for our symptomatic patients, as well as many of the area's EMS teams and peers.

480
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 17,000 tests have been scheduled at that site, and it really has been key in our ability to safely continue to provide care and keep this pandemic under control.

481
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of the COVID world, the work on the Amatory Surgery Center has continued.

482
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:24,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pleased to announce, as we shared with you at the end of the calendar year in our email, that the construction of the ASC is complete, and we have received our certificate of occupancy.

483
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: We have begun providing services with what we are describing as a soft opening at that site, with about two cases per day.

484
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:40,665
[SPEAKER_03]: This is because we must collect appropriate data to meet the requirements for our application to the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Healthcare.

485
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:46,968
[SPEAKER_03]: This association is the joint commission equivalent for ambulatory surgery centers for safety and quality.

486
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:51,090
[SPEAKER_03]: We have submitted our accreditation application and we await the response.

487
00:42:52,283 --> 00:43:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the hospital lobby renovations are nearly complete and will be a new, modern face to the transform campus that we've all worked so hard to achieve.

488
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: As some of you alluded to, I want to address some of your questions head on.

489
00:43:09,812 --> 00:43:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the campus lighting.

490
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:18,834
[SPEAKER_03]: We know this has been a concern for our neighbor, and we agree that lighting should be appropriate for a community setting.

491
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:28,416
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of key elements to the lighting that we reviewed, including hours of care, safety egress, and I've put together the following plan to address the concerns.

492
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:33,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So one source of light is the LMH lobby, the best of legal and the canopy lights.

493
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Those lights will be dimmed to 50% in the evening.

494
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:41,848
[SPEAKER_03]: The baller is outside and the front will turn off in the evening as well.

495
00:43:42,468 --> 00:43:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And inside the surgery center, the post anesthesia recovery area will also turn off once the cleaning is done inside.

496
00:43:50,651 --> 00:43:54,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these changes went into effect late last week.

497
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:58,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Some will go into effect in a couple of weeks when the lobby project is done.

498
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:01,314
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to finish some of the electrical programming on that.

499
00:44:02,491 --> 00:44:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just say the neighbor has our direct contact information and can share any future concerns directly with us.

500
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: for the existing mechanical unit on top of the existing building.

501
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are committed to doing that.

502
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:26,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Our focus as I started my opening remarks in has been on COVID response.

503
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:31,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will give it the attention as requested and as we have communicated to our CAT team.

504
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:41,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we are, I would just say we are very close to the full completion of the project.

505
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to remove much of the construction site materials.

506
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:47,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to announce we have shrunk some of that construction site.

507
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved equipment that's not being used offsite.

508
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to completely closing that, or sorry, shutting that construction site down.

509
00:44:55,513 --> 00:45:05,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to the spring, when we can complete the seasonal plantings and provide the neighborhood with a complete view of the project and the community, a quality state of our facility.

510
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,081
[SPEAKER_03]: As it relates to the CAG and our engagement with the community, I share the sentiment with the Councilors.

511
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,902
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a part of that neighborhood.

512
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:21,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be responsive to our neighbors while we're also deliver healthcare services and transfer from the campus.

513
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:28,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are committed to the CAG, as we have said, early on and throughout the permitting process.

514
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:33,805
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a committee we continue, we foresee us continuing to run into the future.

515
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:43,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're sorry to receive that message from the members presiding, but I also understand it in terms of it's a lot of commitment on their end.

516
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:51,189
[SPEAKER_03]: From a communication standpoint, we've been trying our best to be committed to communication.

517
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We've sent over 25 emails over the past year.

518
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,810
[SPEAKER_03]: About a third of those have been in the past couple of months.

519
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,471
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also received

520
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:02,935
[SPEAKER_03]: 30, 40 individual emails directly from people always trying to engage.

521
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:06,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be actively looking specifically to the CAD.

522
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:11,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be actively looking to replace those numbers and look forward to getting to a regular cadence.

523
00:46:12,243 --> 00:46:17,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Admittedly, those challenges, those meetings have been challenging due to the pandemic going on right now, but we will get back there.

524
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:24,854
[SPEAKER_03]: We are committed to that and look forward to getting back to that ongoing engagement with our neighbors and getting the input from the rest of the community.

525
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:32,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Councilor Marks has a question on the speed bump on Governor's Avenue.

526
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:34,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Speed bump on Governor's Avenue.

527
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you address that?

528
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:39,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry President Cannella, I didn't hear that.

529
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:47,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks has requested that you discuss the speed bump on the top of Governor's Avenue by Southwater Road.

530
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:50,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

531
00:46:51,368 --> 00:46:56,771
[SPEAKER_03]: On that one, we really did take the direction of the City Traffic Department.

532
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I would need them to weigh in on that.

533
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: We took their direction and our construction company essentially did what they told us on that one.

534
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:12,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to wear a bunch of different hats throughout this pandemic.

535
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, Traffic Engineer is not one of them.

536
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:15,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

537
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:25,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. President, I was told by Todd Blake that this was a combined work effort between LMH in the city.

538
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:35,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this aspect was the city's doing, then I would ask that my motion be sent to Todd Blake, the traffic engineer directly and ask if he can take a look at

539
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:53,881
[SPEAKER_11]: the speed hump at the top of Governor's Ave and to see if it's appropriately functioning in its capacity as a speed hump due to its location to Governor's Ave and the fact that it's going up in elevation, which you very seldom see speed humps on inclines, Mr. President.

540
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:57,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that that be reviewed by our traffic engineer.

541
00:47:58,636 --> 00:47:58,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

542
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:08,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just say, Councilor Marks, too, that we did have a civil engineer as part of this project, which many of you saw in terms of the traffic report.

543
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did have collaborative conversations with Todd Blake on that.

544
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:15,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Just BHP is not here, but I think Todd is the right one to start with.

545
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, if there's additional follow up, you can ask our civil engineer for that.

546
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:20,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

547
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:21,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bez.

548
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:23,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

549
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:26,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your presentation, Ryan.

550
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:32,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you mentioned reducing the intensity of the lighting by about 50% at night.

551
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:40,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you been able to figure out how that would compare with the lighting situation prior to the replacement or installation of the new lighting?

552
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,186
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, is it still brighter even at 50% than it was before?

553
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:51,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think it is a different transformation of that, Councilor Bears.

554
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:54,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also say it's not complete either.

555
00:48:54,975 --> 00:49:01,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather it wait until we get the rest of the lobby complete so we can turn on that project to understand what the impacts are.

556
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:13,430
[SPEAKER_03]: We did make some parking changes, bring parking closer to the front door and more handicap accessible, but I don't have that complete review because the project is still under construction.

557
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:17,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah, that's a key issue.

558
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:21,616
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to try to keep the environment the way it was prior to the project began.

559
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:22,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

560
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:23,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

561
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:24,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morelle.

562
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:49:27,684 --> 00:49:29,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the Chair, just following up on that same question about the lighting.

564
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the lights would be dimmed in the evening.

565
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:33,310
[SPEAKER_05]: What constitutes evening?

566
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,492
[SPEAKER_05]: At what time does that start?

567
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:40,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I appreciate the question, Councilor Morell.

568
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them will be after 5 p.m.

569
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:47,638
[SPEAKER_03]: The lobby and the vestibule and the canopy lights will be 5 p.m.

570
00:49:48,138 --> 00:49:50,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the bollards are going to be programmed to around 7.

571
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:58,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the post-anesthesia ASC will be 8, 9 o'clock, depending on when cleaning is done.

572
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:05,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have to get back in there in terms of complete the project, but that is our current plan right now.

573
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:06,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

574
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:09,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there will never be a time when the campus is completely dark.

575
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:11,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

576
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:12,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

577
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:14,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

578
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:15,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

579
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:17,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further questions from the council?

580
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:22,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any questions from the public?

581
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:26,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

582
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:37,658
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Fuller and Sam and the rest of the team for coming out this evening to provide us with an update.

583
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:47,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Secondly, I'm hoping that they can provide us with a little bit of information of how they've done in securing some

584
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:57,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to call them clients, but doctors to fill these rooms that they're going to be creating there.

585
00:50:57,428 --> 00:51:04,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that was one of the concerns that we had was what type of treatment modalities were going to be coming out of there through the ambulatory care center in the medical village.

586
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:13,652
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe Mr. Fuller can tell us some of the highlights of how far they've come along in getting some doctors, recruiting doctors and other practices to the area.

587
00:51:13,672 --> 00:51:15,052
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

588
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:18,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Councilor and I appreciate that.

589
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:24,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say as we're still in a soft opening into that site,

590
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:26,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

591
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,577
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still ongoing efforts.

592
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:40,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some great surgeons who are going to be a part of this campus that are affiliated with Melrose-Makefield Healthcare, Tufts Medical Center, and some of the great organizations across Boston.

593
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:51,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be providing orthopedic care, ENT, ear, nose, and throat care, gastroenterology at the ambulatory surgery center.

594
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:55,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that it will continue to deliver great services for the residents

595
00:51:57,985 --> 00:51:58,927
[SPEAKER_03]: of Medford.

596
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:06,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the rest of the campus, our vision remains the same in terms of bringing additional specialties to that site.

597
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to doing that and transforming that campus now that we have our anchor tenant in place and almost operational.

598
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:23,600
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you could just speak a little bit to the status of the urgent care office, the current and ongoing status at the future of the urgent care office may be.

599
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

600
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So the urgent care office is still open right now, 7 a.m.

601
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:30,562
[SPEAKER_03]: to 11 p.m.

602
00:52:31,263 --> 00:52:35,704
[SPEAKER_03]: The longest hours out of any urgent care in the area.

603
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:37,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very proud of that.

604
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:38,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It has

605
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:44,088
[SPEAKER_03]: carry for COVID and non-COVID patients, seeing good volume.

606
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:55,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in that area, in a collaboration with our urgent care is the COVID testing site, which I mentioned is 17,000 tests that we have done over there on that site.

607
00:52:56,752 --> 00:53:06,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last question, Mr. Fuller, I know recently the state legislature passed a law requiring the proper demarking of a emergency room.

608
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:13,443
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that we had some concerns over the signage on the highway, directing people to a hospital, and some of the signage at the hospital.

609
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:23,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that the city was able to, through the work of the council, write to Mass Highway and have them take down some of the highway signs that guided people to the LMH site as an existing hospital.

610
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:27,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any issues or concerns with the hospital being in compliance with this law at this point in time?

611
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm aware of, Councilor and I, we share the same sentiments.

612
00:53:34,138 --> 00:53:45,810
[SPEAKER_03]: When we made the transition a year and a half ago, we agreed on taking some of those signs down and have made signage across all of the doors on that campus to make sure people are aware.

613
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:47,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

614
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

615
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:48,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

616
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Felkel.

617
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

618
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize.

619
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:54,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to step out of the room for a minute.

620
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:57,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this question has already been answered, I apologize.

621
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:00,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But first and foremost, thank you, Mr. Fuller, for your presentation.

622
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:02,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a couple of quick questions.

623
00:54:02,962 --> 00:54:11,244
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned the soft opening and great surgeons from Tufts Medical and OrthoCare and ENT and Gastro and additional specialists.

624
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:18,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a date like when you would think that this facility will be fully operational with all of these new specialties?

625
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:28,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I do expect what you consider a year one of operations happening in probably the March-April timeframe.

626
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:35,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I consider that year one as any business we would ramp up after that, but kind of the March-April timeframe.

627
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:39,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this coming March-April, you'll start to see things really ramp up?

628
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:40,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

629
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:41,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

630
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:46,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there was a question earlier about the branding of this site, you know, people calling it

631
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:53,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawson Memorial Hospital, LMH, Circle Health, Hallmark Health.

632
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:56,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been any progress with regard to the branding?

633
00:54:56,897 --> 00:55:00,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we talked about before, I think you mentioned it might be called the medical village.

634
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any discussion as to what the end result is or is that still being talked about?

635
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it's still being talked about, Councilor Falco.

636
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:16,149
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a hospital and we have 24-7 services there right now.

637
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Lawrence Memorial Hospital, which is a part of the NOLA's Wakefield Healthcare umbrella.

638
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:30,060
[SPEAKER_03]: But the future branding of that campus as we transform it is something that is still under consideration.

639
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,922
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it's Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

640
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Shields, the surgery center itself is called the Shields Surgery Center.

641
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: which is essentially a tenant now of Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

642
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:46,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any timeline with regard to when that name would change?

643
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:50,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not.

644
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:55,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Admittedly, another thing that has taken a complete sidetrack with COVID.

645
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:56,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

646
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

647
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:58,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

648
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:01,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further questions for Mr. Fuller?

649
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:05,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I see a couple of people on Zoom.

650
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:07,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Knight.

651
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to make the motion, Mr. President.

652
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we bring Mr. Fuller back in 60 days time for a future update.

653
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

654
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:18,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Mr. Clerk, who do we have on for the public?

655
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:25,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Sharon is one of them.

656
00:56:26,226 --> 00:56:27,427
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I saw someone fired.

657
00:56:27,787 --> 00:56:33,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Sharon, Sharon, Sharon, Sharon, do you have, so did you want to speak?

658
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you, Mr. Clerk, could you unmute Chairman Diaso?

659
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:42,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

660
00:56:43,135 --> 00:56:47,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a neighbor of the hospital and- Sharon, name and address of the record, please.

661
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, thank you, President Caraviello.

662
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:53,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharon Diesso on Circuit Road in Medford, Mass.

663
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a neighbor of the hospital.

664
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a patient at the hospital, so have my folks during the years.

665
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:10,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, many of us were concerned and we're very pleased with the rapidity of the construction that's going on in that back section.

666
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:22,270
[SPEAKER_06]: We do, I'll get to that in a second, have some questions about the size of the parking around that new, you know, single level construction.

667
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:29,773
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say even walking, the construction workers have been quite courteous.

668
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:32,194
[SPEAKER_06]: The gates are all appropriate.

669
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:33,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been kept clean.

670
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,238
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of noise at the site going on.

671
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of us were amazed because they put in about the whole Lawrence Road section in Governor's Ave going up towards the parking lot, all the sidewalks replaced except for a few in two days.

672
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:55,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just done orderly.

673
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I commend the construction crew

674
00:57:58,068 --> 00:58:00,851
[SPEAKER_06]: and the manager Howell tonight who's speaking.

675
00:58:02,352 --> 00:58:04,775
[SPEAKER_06]: We were wondering about a commencement date too.

676
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what will happen is things will stop building up starting in the spring.

677
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:15,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I would like to say that the speed bumps

678
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:25,537
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of us came home and saw that ungodly sign because we're used to an upper residential area here with the big yellow sign, speed ahead.

679
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:39,563
[SPEAKER_06]: We were thinking that maybe the sign might be not placed properly and maybe they're just thinking of the speed bump coming ahead, but they're just going and then all of a sudden they hit it.

680
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: or dismissing the sign, putting it up a little bit sooner and getting rid of that bump and just putting the yellow, you know, those petitions that they have in certain parts of the city, they're removable also.

681
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:59,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're a little bit more visible and that may work, I think for a while.

682
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:06,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So people know where they are and they will hesitate to speed up right after they leave one because

683
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:10,949
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that are there now, gentlemen, in Councilor Morell, are black.

684
00:59:11,469 --> 00:59:12,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really can't see them.

685
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So they just kind of keep speeding along.

686
00:59:15,393 --> 00:59:30,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's a help, but the other point I'd like to make is many of us went to many of the meetings that were hosted by the construction company and the real estate company on this venture.

687
00:59:32,096 --> 00:59:41,785
[SPEAKER_06]: it goes to show that if in your area, you do have a project that's going to be assumed that your words, if you are persistent and you continue, I'm not wasted.

688
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:45,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The original design of that hospital site was going to be quite different.

689
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:56,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We even hosted, um, the wonderful nurse who was also director of Morell's Wakefield a couple of times at a meeting, um, with our lions club.

690
00:59:57,421 --> 01:00:02,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they designed first is different than what's there now.

691
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it will accommodate the public amply.

692
01:00:05,308 --> 01:00:06,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking forward to it.

693
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:07,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank you for your time.

694
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:08,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye bye.

695
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:11,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Esso.

696
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:14,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any other, any other public, anybody else?

697
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:17,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see any, I don't see any more hands up.

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

717
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:25,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

718
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:33,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my understanding after a brief conversation with you over the weekend that you have put together a series of Committee of the Whole meetings, and this is one of the items that I'm going to discuss.

719
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:35,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That is one of the meetings that will take place.

01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:41,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

723
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:43,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you want to speak?

724
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I was on the speak.

725
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,971

728
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:55,685

01:01:57,596 --> 01:01:59,797
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-033 offered by Vice President Knight.

730
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:04,921

731
01:02:05,062 --> 01:02:07,964

732
01:02:08,084 --> 01:02:11,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to speak to this because this is an item that you have marked up for a committee of the whole.

733
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:12,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

734
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:13,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

735
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:15,950
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-034 offered by Councilor Morell.

736
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:20,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the City Council move forward with the Gender Equity Commission Ordinance.

737
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:21,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell.

738
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:23,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

739
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:27,228
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one item that wasn't on the list, so I do owe you an email about this.

740
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:31,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is an item that first came before the Council in the spring of 2019.

741
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:34,372
[SPEAKER_05]: A number of meetings were held on it.

742
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:35,773
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a call to continue.

743
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: work towards this ordinance last year, and we didn't get back to it in Committee of the Whole until, I believe, October.

744
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:47,294
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the things I'm actually asked about most by residents asking when this is going to move forward.

745
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:48,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just ask that.

746
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:53,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it still sits in committee, was not, still sits in committee, was not voted out of Committee of the Whole.

747
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:56,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still work to be done there.

748
01:02:57,561 --> 01:03:00,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I do just ask that we act in it with all expediency and

749
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of discussion last week about concerns of the many roles our Director of Diversity is being asked to hold.

750
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:18,564
[SPEAKER_05]: This, of course, Commission would not take the position of a, would not take place of a full-time position, but it is something that can absolutely aid in that work.

751
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:24,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's an urgent matter prior to, but in light of last week's discussions, it continues to be an urgent matter.

752
01:03:24,627 --> 01:03:27,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just hope we can meet on this as soon as possible.

753
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:33,122
[SPEAKER_05]: agree on this, find a place we agree on this, and move forward.

754
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:52,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell, so this was last talked about October 21, 2020, and under President Falco, this was sent to Solicitor Scanlon to provide an updated version with the ordinance, with recommendations and change, and

755
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:55,378
[SPEAKER_13]: to have another meeting to discuss the changes.

756
01:03:56,678 --> 01:04:03,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I will reach out to the city solicitor to see if she has made those changes.

757
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:04,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

758
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:05,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

759
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:12,644
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Falco.

760
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:13,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm moving forward.

761
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:16,205
[SPEAKER_15]: To move forward.

762
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:18,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

763
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

764
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:21,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

765
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

766
01:04:24,373 --> 01:04:24,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

767
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:25,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

768
01:04:26,054 --> 01:04:26,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

769
01:04:26,975 --> 01:04:27,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

770
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:27,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

771
01:04:28,537 --> 01:04:29,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell?

772
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:30,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

773
01:04:30,478 --> 01:04:31,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

774
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

775
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:32,480
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello?

776
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:32,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

777
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

778
01:04:36,503 --> 01:04:38,805
[SPEAKER_13]: 21035 offered by Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks.

779
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:46,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the DPW install a crosswalk on Fels Ave at the intersection of Hickory Ave and Fels Ave in the interest of public safety.

780
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:47,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

781
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:50,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I confer with Councilor Falco.

782
01:04:50,915 --> 01:04:51,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

783
01:04:53,043 --> 01:04:56,035
I received calls from residents in the neighborhood.

784
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:05,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I've received calls from residents in the neighborhood about the traffic at the top of Fell's Ave.

785
01:05:05,414 --> 01:05:21,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you approach the top of Fell's Ave, if you're heading down towards Fern Road, that side of Fell's Ave, there are some signs there that say, basically, drive slow, children, school bus, stop ahead.

786
01:05:22,337 --> 01:05:27,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point in time, there was a crosswalk in front of, I believe it was 185 Fern Road.

787
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:28,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that.

788
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It just never got painted again.

789
01:05:31,671 --> 01:05:43,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's faded out and it's a section of the road where really you need some sort of I would think crosswalk because that's where the road really widens when you go towards.

790
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:48,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Fells Ave or if you bear left, you're gonna go towards Hickory Ave and towards Oak Road.

791
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:54,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a really wide point in the road there that is a... Can be a problem when people cross.

792
01:05:54,204 --> 01:06:01,730
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the interest of public safety, if we could please have a crosswalk installed by the DPW in that vicinity.

793
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:08,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the police could probably weigh in and the traffic engineer as to where it would be best.

794
01:06:08,576 --> 01:06:11,498
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that section, there used to be a crosswalk.

795
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:13,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could have a crosswalk installed

796
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:16,124
[SPEAKER_01]: in that area.

797
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:17,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly appreciate it.

798
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:17,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

799
01:06:22,568 --> 01:06:23,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

800
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:24,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

801
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:29,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank councilor Falco for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

802
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:33,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, this council has made great strides over the last several months.

803
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:47,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, we should all be proud of ourself for the initiative, Mr. President, that we took to meet with the area residents, uh, on Fulton spring road to listen to their concerns, Mr. President, when many of them thought that, uh, the city didn't care about,

804
01:06:48,346 --> 01:06:50,227
[SPEAKER_11]: cut through traffic and speeding in the area.

805
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:54,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And indeed, a number of changes have been made up in that area.

806
01:06:55,148 --> 01:06:57,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't, you know, we're not done with it.

807
01:06:58,209 --> 01:07:04,991
[SPEAKER_11]: A number of changes have been made to take corrective action on some of the concerns of area residents.

808
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:11,173
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just another one, Mr. President, that will help provide for pedestrian safety in that area.

809
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:14,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to just reiterate, Mr. President, I know you just

810
01:07:14,474 --> 01:07:31,330
[SPEAKER_11]: sent out your committee, the whole, um, outstanding meetings that, uh, we have a committee, the whole that this council voted on, I believe at least twice, uh, to maintain a presence in that area regarding, uh, safety and cut through traffic.

811
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:33,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask once again, Mr. President,

812
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:50,766
[SPEAKER_11]: when we start going through these meetings that we have a committee of the whole to discuss what I believe is the most important issue in that area, resident only access on certain roads, Molly Hill Road, Fulton Spring Road, Terrace Road, Grover Road, in the interest of public safety.

813
01:07:51,446 --> 01:08:00,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could put all the signage up and all the humps and hurdles and everything else, but unless we defer traffic somewhere else,

814
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:06,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the residents didn't experience and be inundated with this cut through traffic.

815
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:14,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the very least, I think we should try the resident only access or no right turn, no left turn between certain hours.

816
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked to the city traffic engineer.

817
01:08:18,071 --> 01:08:21,414
[SPEAKER_11]: He said sometimes the resident only is not that effective.

818
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:24,858
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, however, a no right or no left turn can

819
01:08:25,378 --> 01:08:33,023
[SPEAKER_11]: resolve the same issues, and I'm not opposed to any signage that would solve the issue.

820
01:08:33,383 --> 01:08:40,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So I look forward to meeting with this council and committee to hold to keep this very important issue up, Mr. President.

821
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:44,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Council member, did you want to do this on site on a Saturday or just a regular meeting?

822
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,651
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe we have to go on site again at this particular point.

823
01:08:47,971 --> 01:08:48,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've all been there.

824
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:51,732
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a matter of keeping this issue in the forefront.

825
01:08:52,332 --> 01:09:03,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And two weeks ago, I believe I offered a motion that was unanimously supported by this council, asking the traffic engineer and the traffic commission to once again look at resident only signs.

826
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:06,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Mr. Clerk, if we got a response back.

827
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:09,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember seeing anything on that.

828
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,543
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the answer to that question, but I can check the records and get back to you tomorrow.

829
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:15,383
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

830
01:09:15,483 --> 01:09:16,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't recall seeing anything.

831
01:09:16,705 --> 01:09:21,469
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's one of the reasons, Mr. President, I ask that we stay on top of these very important issues.

832
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:21,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

833
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco.

834
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:25,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

835
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:29,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just also wanted to thank Councilor Marks for co-sponsoring this with me.

836
01:09:29,893 --> 01:09:38,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And Councilor Marks stressed a point that I think is something that we really need to do, and that's the follow-up, and that's the committee, the whole meeting.

837
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:41,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely agree that we need to do that sooner than later.

838
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:50,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian, if we could also, I think when Councilor Marks maybe mentioned this a few weeks ago, I just want to reiterate that we need to do robocall as well on that meeting.

839
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:56,365
[SPEAKER_01]: just like we did with the first one for that same list of streets, same list of residents.

840
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:57,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great.

841
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,186
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great turnout at that meeting.

842
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:03,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very productive, and I'm hoping and thinking that this meeting will yield the same results.

843
01:10:03,928 --> 01:10:04,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

844
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:05,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Franco.

845
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

846
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:14,573
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by

847
01:10:16,374 --> 01:10:21,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco, that a roll call go along before the committee of the whole.

848
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:23,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

849
01:10:24,056 --> 01:10:25,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

850
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

851
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:29,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

852
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:30,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

853
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:31,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

854
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

855
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:33,538
Yes.

856
01:10:33,858 --> 01:10:34,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

857
01:10:34,738 --> 01:10:35,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

858
01:10:35,478 --> 01:10:36,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell?

859
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:36,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

860
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

861
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:38,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

862
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:39,648
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caraviello.

863
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:41,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, affirmative motion passes.

864
01:10:41,752 --> 01:10:44,197
[SPEAKER_13]: 21036 offered by Councilor Marks.

865
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:49,467
[SPEAKER_13]: We have resolved that the city council received an update on fire station roof leaks.

866
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:50,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

867
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

868
01:10:53,652 --> 01:11:03,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Several months back, the city administration put together several task force, of which one is the Fire Department Facilities Task Force.

869
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:09,278
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been meeting, I guess, for several months with all the interested parties in the community.

870
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:17,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's my understanding that we have several concerns, immediate concerns, regarding engine four and engine six.

871
01:11:18,762 --> 01:11:19,723
[SPEAKER_11]: for leaking roofs.

872
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:29,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are the buildings that our brave firefighters spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day in when they're not on calls, Mr. President.

873
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:34,659
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's only important that we stay on top of these aging buildings.

874
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:40,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I did receive a call this afternoon from the mayor.

875
01:11:40,802 --> 01:11:59,647
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor stated that they're in the process of hiring a project manager, so once the task force makes their recommendation, they will hire a project manager, and that project manager will be responsible for putting together all the items that the task force discussed on our facilities.

876
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:02,888
[SPEAKER_11]: As you recall, Mr. President, I think everyone behind this rail

877
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:09,450
[SPEAKER_11]: was part of the site visits at the fire station, at all our fire stations.

878
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:15,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And we compiled several lists over the last several years, unfortunately.

879
01:12:16,092 --> 01:12:26,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And many of which have not come to fruition on some of the major concerns that our firefighters face within these aging facilities.

880
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:42,961
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm hoping that this task force will reap some results in moving forward on at least addressing some of the health and safety concerns that our firefighters face, not only in fires, but unfortunately at the fire stations as well.

881
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:45,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, you know.

882
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:49,445
[SPEAKER_11]: a concern that's been around this community for a number of years, Mr. President.

883
01:12:49,885 --> 01:12:57,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that we receive an update from the city administration regarding Engine 4 and Engine 6 roof leaks.

884
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:11,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can get an update, because it's been a while, on the task force, where it stands, when the recommendations will be out, and when they anticipate a project manager will be hired to move forward on these important issues.

885
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

886
01:13:12,581 --> 01:13:12,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

887
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:18,136
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

888
01:13:18,796 --> 01:13:19,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we amend?

889
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:20,797
Do we amend?

890
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,717
[SPEAKER_13]: You had no amendment on that, Councilor Marks.

891
01:13:24,457 --> 01:13:25,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there an amendment on that?

892
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:26,958
[SPEAKER_13]: That we get an update.

893
01:13:27,118 --> 01:13:27,698
[SPEAKER_11]: We get an update.

894
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:40,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, an update about engine four and engine six, the roof leaks, and when the task force will be, if we can get an update on the task force, where it stands, and when a project manager will be brought on board.

895
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:42,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

896
01:13:42,162 --> 01:13:43,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

897
01:13:49,435 --> 01:13:49,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

898
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:51,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

899
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:54,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco vice president night.

900
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:54,682
Yes.

901
01:13:55,824 --> 01:13:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Council marks.

902
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:57,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

903
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Morell.

904
01:13:58,607 --> 01:13:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

905
01:13:59,188 --> 01:13:59,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor scrub Kelly.

906
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,370
Yes.

907
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:02,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Present care of yellow.

908
01:14:02,753 --> 01:14:02,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

909
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:06,378
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 affirmative motion passes communications from the mayor.

910
01:14:08,894 --> 01:14:16,940
[SPEAKER_13]: 21037 to President Richard Caraviello and honorable members of the City Council, Premier Breanna Lungo-Koehn, RE, licensing of food trucks.

911
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:26,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear President Caraviello and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request that the City Council approve the following request for a food truck at the Andrews School.

912
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:41,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the city's temporary policies limiting events and gatherings, the attached application includes some unique considerations which have been reviewed and approved by my office as well as the Board of Health.

913
01:14:41,509 --> 01:14:48,792
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a request for two food trucks to be stationed at the Andrews School for pickup of pre-ordered dinner items.

914
01:14:49,213 --> 01:14:51,974
[SPEAKER_13]: No congregating will be allowed as part of this plan.

915
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:55,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford Streets, food truck for the PTO fundraiser.

916
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:58,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Date, February 10th, 2021.

917
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:02,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Time, 4 to 7 p.m.

918
01:15:02,404 --> 01:15:03,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Setup begins at 3 o'clock.

919
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:06,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Location, Andrews Middle School.

920
01:15:06,411 --> 01:15:07,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your consideration.

921
01:15:08,194 --> 01:15:09,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Brannon Lungo-Koehn.

922
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:14,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Knight.

923
01:15:15,066 --> 01:15:19,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I'm just wondering where this item is something.

924
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:34,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let me start with, if we look back several years ago, the school department, I do believe, through their school committee, established a policy on accepting donations and also a policy on the use of school facilities and grounds.

925
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:40,871
[SPEAKER_15]: And before this matter comes before the council, my question to the administration would be, has the school committee approved the proposed use?

926
01:15:43,943 --> 01:15:46,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot answer that, Mr. Vice President.

927
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:54,204
[SPEAKER_15]: The second concern I have, Mr. President, when you're looking at the application, if you see the application that's before us, we have

928
01:15:55,527 --> 01:16:00,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Food Truck Festivals of America, 50C3 status, no, a for-profit organization.

929
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:06,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Then if you turn to page two of the application, Mr. President, you'll see we add 16% to each meal's costs.

930
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:10,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Families pre-order a meal and welcome the opportunity to also support the school's PTO as well.

931
01:16:11,437 --> 01:16:15,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So it seems to me like this is just a surcharge on a meal that then gets passed along to the PTO.

932
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:22,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are some concerns that I have based on my first and initial view at this application, Mr. President.

933
01:16:25,866 --> 01:16:26,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scappelli.

934
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:31,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody from the administration or from the Andrews PTO?

935
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:34,989
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Jackie Peeks and Vivian Sue.

936
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:36,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Jackie, do you want to speak on this?

937
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:40,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

938
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the opportunity.

939
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:49,153
[SPEAKER_07]: So with regard to Councilor Knights first question, I have not submitted it to the school committee for their consideration.

940
01:16:49,173 --> 01:16:50,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to do so.

941
01:16:51,277 --> 01:17:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Vivian Sue, I believe, is a representative of the Andrews School PTO and may have some additional information about conversations that she has had with the school administration.

942
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:07,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Vivian is the one who made the request directly with Streets to have this fundraiser and this event at the Andrews, so.

943
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm satisfied with your looking into it.

944
01:17:09,991 --> 01:17:12,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's a function of government that has to go through the process, right?

945
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:18,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So if the school committee hasn't voted on it, then why don't we just table it, and when they do, we'll come back and revisit the situation?

946
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:21,531
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

947
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:23,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

948
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:25,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Hsu, do you want to speak on this?

949
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:26,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no problem hearing what Ms.

950
01:17:26,235 --> 01:17:29,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Hsu has to say, but in terms of, it has to go through a process.

951
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,342
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd feel more comfortable if that process was approved before we approve this.

952
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:34,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

953
01:17:34,543 --> 01:17:36,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Or took even consideration on deliberation.

954
01:17:37,306 --> 01:17:39,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Vivian Hsu, name and address of the record, please.

955
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:40,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of a re.

956
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,372
[SPEAKER_00]: request to have it done.

957
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:11,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

958
01:18:11,912 --> 01:18:21,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Hsu, if I can recall, it wasn't approved because there was no specific dates when it was originally put out there.

959
01:18:22,174 --> 01:18:22,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

960
01:18:23,054 --> 01:18:27,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Anytime we've done that in the past, it's always been a date specific event.

961
01:18:28,155 --> 01:18:29,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification, we approved it once.

962
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:30,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

963
01:18:30,276 --> 01:18:31,276
[SPEAKER_15]: They held zero events.

964
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:34,657
[SPEAKER_15]: They came back for another permit.

965
01:18:35,537 --> 01:18:36,457
[SPEAKER_15]: We denied that permit.

966
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:36,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

967
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:39,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was no dates or times.

968
01:18:39,821 --> 01:18:45,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, because we didn't want to also harm our brick and mortar restaurants in the community during the middle of the COVID pandemic.

969
01:18:46,686 --> 01:18:48,087
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Ms.

970
01:18:48,347 --> 01:18:49,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Anger, I think her name is, Ms.

971
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:56,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Angry, she left and we voted it down and then their application was withdrawn.

972
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:56,834
[SPEAKER_15]: And now this is the...

973
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,041
[SPEAKER_15]: That wasn't a fundraiser.

974
01:19:00,061 --> 01:19:01,241
[SPEAKER_15]: That was to go into the neighborhoods.

975
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:01,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

976
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:16,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So this was never before the council before to be on school premises or, um, or to be, um, some sort of donation, um, have some sort of donation mechanism, both of which need to be approved by the school committee if it's going to be on their grounds and if those funds are going to go to the PTO.

977
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:17,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.

978
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:29,158
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty excited because as you know, with COVID that we've been, it's been very difficult to run any school fundraiser or any of the traditional school fundraisers and to raise funds for the schools.

979
01:19:29,678 --> 01:19:33,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when this opportunity was presented, we said, well, it sounds great.

980
01:19:34,283 --> 01:19:43,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there would be a surcharge on the meals and the meals would be pre-purchased and all the surcharge would go to the PTO as the fundraiser.

981
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:47,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

982
01:19:49,901 --> 01:19:51,843
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, thank you, Miss Sue.

983
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:59,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that you've done so much volunteer work, not just for the Andrews, but the McGlynn for many, many years.

984
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:02,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate all your dedication.

985
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:14,622
[SPEAKER_12]: But just to familiarize this council, when we run other fundraisers with the brick and mortar stores, do they typically also add the percentage onto the fees?

986
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that common practice?

987
01:20:21,068 --> 01:20:21,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I know she's running it.

988
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:34,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm representing the Andrews PTO.

989
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, so I know, just a question, maybe you know, maybe you don't know.

990
01:20:38,352 --> 01:20:41,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know if like, I know we've done so many others with the brick and mortar stores.

991
01:20:42,734 --> 01:20:50,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it typical practice that they would have a set fee and then add a certain percentage on that fee to bring in money for a fundraiser?

992
01:20:51,923 --> 01:20:53,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the answer to that question.

993
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:58,029
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason why I bring it up, because maybe you were familiar with the meeting we had, maybe not.

994
01:20:58,049 --> 01:21:01,032
[SPEAKER_12]: But we had a meeting with the representatives from the food truck.

995
01:21:01,553 --> 01:21:08,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really disingenuous that they came in front of us saying they will do the same thing that our brick and mortar stores will do.

996
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:13,605
[SPEAKER_12]: And they would commit, and they donate, and they would give so much back to our community.

997
01:21:14,165 --> 01:21:18,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm so disheartened that that's their practice.

998
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:22,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that doesn't reflect anything on you or the PTOs.

999
01:21:22,892 --> 01:21:31,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that you're trying everything you can do, believe me, to try to get anything going in the positive direction to raise funds for our kids.

1000
01:21:31,879 --> 01:21:38,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know my wife's dealing with it right now with a senior in high school and trying to figure out.

1001
01:21:39,385 --> 01:21:51,893
[SPEAKER_12]: what we can raise to help to do something for our students at the end of the year to give them something positive they can fall back on, they can remember such a horrible year and a half that they've gone through.

1002
01:21:51,933 --> 01:22:03,841
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that my message is to those food truck providers that I'm a little disappointed that that's how they do that because, like I said, I think I'm familiar with

1003
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:10,884
[SPEAKER_12]: the brick and mortar stores that run these fundraisers, it's 10% of whatever they bring in at the regular fee.

1004
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:25,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And we talk about the haves and the have nots in the community, and it's sad to think that there are families that want to do this fundraiser, but won't be able to participate because inflated prices from a food truck.

1005
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:26,493
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, thank you.

1006
01:22:27,348 --> 01:22:27,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

1007
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:29,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Piller, you are correct.

1008
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:34,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Normally with the restaurants, the brick and mortar, they usually it's a percentage of the sales.

1009
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:35,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1010
01:22:36,615 --> 01:22:37,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1011
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:39,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1012
01:22:39,338 --> 01:22:42,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't have any particular questions.

1013
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:48,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I do agree with Councilor Knight that this definitely should be signed off by the school committee.

1014
01:22:49,246 --> 01:22:51,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I would ask and maybe,

1015
01:22:54,987 --> 01:23:01,392
[SPEAKER_11]: The petitioner would know better than I that if we were to hold off, we don't meet until February 2nd.

1016
01:23:02,032 --> 01:23:06,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that enough lead time if we were to hold off on this?

1017
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:12,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind making our paper contingent upon approval from the school committee, which I think may be a better idea.

1018
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:18,985
[SPEAKER_11]: The fee that's being charged, this is a fundraiser if people want to go and partake.

1019
01:23:19,845 --> 01:23:23,649
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll pay the additional money, they'll go back to the schools, it's for one day.

1020
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:32,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't think that's an imposition to brick and mortar businesses for the one day, the fact that it's a fundraiser.

1021
01:23:32,838 --> 01:23:38,584
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would support this tonight, contingent upon approval by the school committee, Mr. President.

1022
01:23:39,404 --> 01:23:40,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be my motion tonight.

1023
01:23:43,397 --> 01:23:46,058
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd say that the timeline is sensitive, right?

1024
01:23:46,138 --> 01:23:58,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we want to hold the fundraiser on February 10th, then we would love to have as much time to advertise, to allow our school as well as the community to know about the event.

1025
01:23:58,702 --> 01:24:02,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had to wait, that would give us a very, very short timeline.

1026
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:04,620
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would agree with you.

1027
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:13,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. President, based on my recommendation then, if we approve it tonight, then it'll be up to the organizer to go before the school committee.

1028
01:24:13,444 --> 01:24:14,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know when they meet next.

1029
01:24:14,564 --> 01:24:21,407
[SPEAKER_11]: They may have to have an emergency meeting or whatever to discuss this or approve it or whatever their protocols are.

1030
01:24:21,467 --> 01:24:25,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least we're not standing in the way and at this point I feel comfortable.

1031
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:29,891
[SPEAKER_11]: moving it forward, Mr. President, based on what I'm hearing tonight.

1032
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:41,919
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would offer that as a motion that we approve it conditionally based on approval by the school committee for one day, February 10th from four to seven.

1033
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:45,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And the setup begins at 3 p.m.

1034
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:50,164
[SPEAKER_11]: on the Andrews School upon condition and approval by the school committee.

1035
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:52,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Knight.

1036
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:54,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Knight.

1037
01:24:55,877 --> 01:25:05,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, I can understand what Councilor Marks coming from and, you know, in the interest of supporting our PTO locally, um, I will go along with that tonight.

1038
01:25:06,758 --> 01:25:16,521
[SPEAKER_15]: However, to see a for-profit organization gouge the community for 16%, in my opinion, this is in no way, shape, or form an effort to give to our community.

1039
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,482
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an effort for them to open the door to get into our community.

1040
01:25:20,383 --> 01:25:20,923
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1041
01:25:20,963 --> 01:25:25,324
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't like a brick and mortar store that wants to give back to the population that's made them successful.

1042
01:25:25,865 --> 01:25:32,867
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an entity that wants to come into Medford and wants to bring food trucks up and down our streets and compete with our brick and mortar stores who have always been there for us.

1043
01:25:33,517 --> 01:25:34,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my concern.

1044
01:25:34,538 --> 01:25:41,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see this as necessarily a business that's coming to Medford that wants to do well.

1045
01:25:41,524 --> 01:25:50,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that this is a business that's coming to Medford that just got a permit denied, and now because they got a permit denied, now they're saying, well, what can we do to butter up the city council to get further access to more permits?

1046
01:25:51,532 --> 01:25:56,115
[SPEAKER_15]: But I will go along this evening with what Councilor Marks has proposed, and I will second his motion.

1047
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:57,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1048
01:25:58,671 --> 01:25:59,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1049
01:25:59,652 --> 01:26:01,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree wholeheartedly with Councilor Knight.

1050
01:26:02,313 --> 01:26:06,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now we don't have any information to rely on.

1051
01:26:06,716 --> 01:26:13,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this fundraiser turns out to be successful based on whatever the agreement was,

1052
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:17,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Then next time they come before us, we'll make that determination.

1053
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:23,505
[SPEAKER_11]: If it turns out to be not a big money maker, then we'll make that determination as well.

1054
01:26:24,265 --> 01:26:27,406
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a great fundraiser on behalf of our schools.

1055
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:33,689
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to see what happens and trial by fire, more or less.

1056
01:26:34,109 --> 01:26:40,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do also want to point out that we can't control when, how, and if the school committee even takes this matter up.

1057
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:50,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I just want to reiterate it.

1058
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:52,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with Council Marks.

1059
01:26:52,637 --> 01:26:58,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that being that it's time sensitive, it's not the PTO's fault.

1060
01:26:58,364 --> 01:27:05,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it's getting into politics that they shouldn't be punished for.

1061
01:27:06,032 --> 01:27:11,754
[SPEAKER_12]: what the food trucks are trying to pull as an end around, in my eyes, that tried to get into our community.

1062
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:16,496
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I see is a negative impact to our brick and mortar.

1063
01:27:16,876 --> 01:27:20,018
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wholeheartedly agree with this, Councilor Markson.

1064
01:27:20,578 --> 01:27:30,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope the PTO and the Andrews raise a whole lot of money for a whole bunch of activities for our kids that really probably need it.

1065
01:27:30,522 --> 01:27:31,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1066
01:27:31,903 --> 01:27:32,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And good luck, Vivian.

1067
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:33,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1068
01:27:34,185 --> 01:27:41,809
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks, that this be approved by school committee, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1069
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1070
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:44,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Conditional approval.

1071
01:27:45,671 --> 01:27:46,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Conditional approval.

1072
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:47,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the school committee approval.

1073
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:50,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the school committee approval.

1074
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:55,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

1075
01:27:56,817 --> 01:27:57,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1076
01:27:57,957 --> 01:27:58,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1077
01:27:58,758 --> 01:27:58,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1078
01:27:59,758 --> 01:28:00,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

1079
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:01,359
Yes.

1080
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:02,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

1081
01:28:03,549 --> 01:28:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1082
01:28:08,052 --> 01:28:09,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1083
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:09,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1084
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,593
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, affirmative motion passes.

1085
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:16,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Reports of committees to one zero one eight January 19th.

1086
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:19,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Committee of the Whole report to follow.

1087
01:28:20,815 --> 01:28:34,903
[SPEAKER_13]: This particular Committee of the Whole report was from last week discussing personnel positions and no action was taken on this, so there's nothing to report out on this.

1088
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:38,985
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1089
01:28:39,285 --> 01:28:40,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1090
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:45,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

1091
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1092
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

1093
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:48,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1094
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:49,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

1095
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:50,272
Yes.

1096
01:28:50,732 --> 01:28:51,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

1097
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1098
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell?

1099
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:53,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1100
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1101
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:55,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1102
01:28:55,555 --> 01:28:56,256
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello?

1103
01:28:56,556 --> 01:28:56,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1104
01:28:56,836 --> 01:28:58,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

1105
01:28:58,697 --> 01:29:00,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, do we have any papers in your hands?

1106
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:01,419
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not.

1107
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,422
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no papers in the hands of the clerk.

1108
01:29:07,864 --> 01:29:12,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Records were passed to... Councilor Bears.

1109
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:14,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

1110
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears, how did you find the records?

1111
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,784
[SPEAKER_17]: I found the clerk's work fastidious and precise, and I move approval.

1112
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:26,608
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1113
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:28,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1114
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:31,852
