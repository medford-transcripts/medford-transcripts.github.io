00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:11,961
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,362
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,403
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:20,744
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:28,907
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:32,789
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,290
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,428
All right, thanks so much for joining me tonight.

10
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:55,329
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,950
First of all, thank you so much for having me, Danielle.

12
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,370
My name is Justin Tseng.

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,852
I'm one of our city councillors here in Bedford, Massachusetts, and my pronouns are he and he him.

14
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,763
All right, thanks, Justin.

15
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:12,546
So we're going to talk a little bit about your campaign for re-election for city council tonight.

16
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:19,412
But before we do that, I'm just going to ask you to answer this question that I know you've answered before, but a lot has changed in Medford in the last few years.

17
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:24,717
So I'll ask you again, if you could share your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

18
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:28,618
I always find this question to be the hardest one of the interview.

19
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:35,903
I bounce a lot between different places, especially with so many new places opening.

20
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:41,927
But I found myself bringing my friends to Starby BBQ a lot in Bedford Square.

21
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,210
They do a really great Korean barbecue all you can eat.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,232
It's super reasonably priced and the setup is really cool as well.

23
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,635
Is that like near donuts with a difference on that same block?

24
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:59,385
Yeah, it's right across from the bubble tea shop by where the CVS used to be.

25
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:00,986
Oh, nice, nice.

26
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,649
Yeah, it looks cool in there through the window.

27
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,711
I've never been in, but maybe I'll have to give it a try.

28
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,834
Yeah, it's always pretty popping as well.

29
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:18,563
There's long lines out the door on the weekends, but you go in, you get the table, and honestly, the options are just endless and everything is good.

30
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:21,791
All right, well, thanks, Justin.

31
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:26,493
So, um, we could just start by, you know, talking a little bit about your current campaign.

32
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,615
So this, if you were reelected in November, this, that would be your 3rd.

33
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:37,038
Um, term as city councilor in Medford, um, so this is your 3rd time running a campaign as well.

34
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:40,920
So I'm wondering if you can kind of like, reflect on the last few years and.

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,082
Kind of what you've learned and what you're kind of hoping to take into the next, um.

36
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:46,903
The next term, yeah.

37
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:49,664
Yeah, this is a, it's a huge question.

38
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:51,870
Over the last few years.

39
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,412
We as a city have made record investments in our schools and in our streets.

40
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:05,616
We've hired a new road repair crew, built big sidewalks as well, and we've saved 40 teaching jobs as well.

41
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:14,701
We've made historic progress when it comes to reforms to make housing more affordable and to make City Hall much more accessible and transparent than ever before.

42
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:19,443
And, you know, I believe that at this election, we have

43
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:26,807
a chance, we have the chance to turn these moments of progress into momentum for the future.

44
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:32,510
But, you know, when I look at, especially this last year,

45
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:36,462
we can see that the world is a rapidly changing place.

46
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:40,645
National politicians are really gambling with our economy.

47
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,446
They're threatening the safety of our neighbors.

48
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:48,770
We're seeing big money influences trickle into city politics as well, attack ads, mailers.

49
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:58,416
And I think it contributes to this tone of instability and uncertainty about where we go heading forward now.

50
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,518
And my perspective is that

51
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:06,499
through these really uncertain times, we need steady leadership and we need bold leadership as well.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,500
And ultimately, that's why I'm running for re-election.

53
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:21,684
I'm running for re-election to keep standing up for our values, for who we are, and to keep building a future and a city that's made for us all.

54
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:28,136
You know, I think this is a moment where effort can really shine amongst neighbors.

55
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:42,063
We can really prove that when we lead with heart, when we lead with the values that bind us all together and do what's right, we can really turn our values into real tangible results for our residents.

56
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:55,071
When you ask this question about the retrospective, going back my four years on the city council, I always return to why I ran in the first place.

57
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:06,177
And when I first ran, what we saw was decades of inaction, leading to our schools suffering huge cuts during the pandemic.

58
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:13,660
folks being priced out of the city, real racial reckoning on our hands with the Black Lives Matter and the Stop Asian Hate movement.

59
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,262
And I think simply put, the status quo just wasn't working.

60
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:31,287
But when I look at what I've learned over these last four years trying to work on these issues, I've learned that our city really does have a shared vision for our future.

61
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,308
I think when you share a vision for a future that's inclusive,

62
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,234
that centered around growing together, saying yes to new opportunities.

63
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:47,958
I've learned that we have so much work to get done, but we can't actually do a lot of work when we work as a team together.

64
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:53,181
And I think that's been an especially real success of the last two years.

65
00:05:54,381 --> 00:06:07,349
When I think about the colleagues that I've been working with on the city council and the school committee, the city staff that we've been working with, and also just expanding the table so that more people have seats at that table to participate in that.

66
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:11,093
you know, policymaking process to have more of a say.

67
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:17,509
And, you know, working with residents directly to pass so many of these reforms that I've been talking about.

68
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:27,064
That's been a real lesson for me in terms of, I've always known that teamwork was important, but teamwork really does get us across the finish line.

69
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:45,710
And I think another lesson I've learned is that it's easy to sit there and scream and shout about issues, but it's a lot harder to roll up your sleeves and to do the hard work, to do your homework when it comes to what policies will actually get us to that finish line.

70
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:58,996
that shared vision, that shared future that we all see together, to know, you know, when to speak up, to know when sometimes speaking up can jeopardize that future, you know.

71
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:03,138
And so those are real lessons that I've had.

72
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:14,443
And so when I think about my goals in Medford, working towards a better city for us all, I think about

73
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:23,266
Oh, without, you know, the lessons I've learned over these last few years, we wouldn't be able to make progress.

74
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:34,499
I was worried when I first ran that the kids coming after me in school, my friends, brothers and sisters, wouldn't be able to have the same opportunities that I would have.

75
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:41,914
The world was in such a shaky place in 2020 with the pandemic and with everything that ensued afterwards.

76
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:55,379
And, you know, it's, again, I spoke a little bit earlier to the uncertainty of the moment, but I really do believe that working together, that teamwork, that response, that sense of responsibility can really help us move forward and not turn backwards.

77
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,881
Yeah, you're reminding me of when I started this podcast.

78
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,602
It was right around that time.

79
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:10,609
I think right before, right during your first campaign and what everything felt like in Medford then.

80
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,172
I was sort of new to paying attention to local politics.

81
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:18,654
even in those, like, these, like, last four years, so much feels like it's changed.

82
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:30,316
And my question, I think, that I posed to, like, a lot of those candidates in that first year of doing this was, like, how can we make Medford more of, like, an equitable and inclusive place?

83
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:40,577
And just in terms of, like, representation, like, in these, like, in city government, but just, like, generally, I think we've come a long way just in those few years.

84
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:44,738
What work do you think is upcoming in that way?

85
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:52,180
I mean, this is another huge question.

86
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,563
I think there's a few buckets, generally, that I think of when I think of that question.

87
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,124
I think of affordability.

88
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:07,647
I think of what's happening to us federally, the cuts that we're seeing, the attacks on our safety and our

89
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:13,190
our rights that we're seeing from the federal government and the fear that that's creating in our neighborhoods.

90
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,633
I think of schools and city services and those basic operations that we need to move forward.

91
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:26,157
And I mean, let me leave it there and then we can we can kind of delve into those topics.

92
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,699
Yeah, no, I definitely have some follow ups.

93
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:36,583
I think one of the in talking to other candidates, I think there's some like some sort of like divided thought about

94
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:44,227
what the place that city council, that local government has when it comes to matters of the federal government.

95
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:57,415
It feels obvious to me why we need to be involved, but how do you see your role on city council as impacting, or I guess having an impact on the city in this sort of greater context that we're in?

96
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:02,278
Yeah, I mean, since day one of my very first campaign back in 2021,

97
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:08,857
I've always said national politics can be local politics.

98
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,558
National issues can be local issues.

99
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:16,642
I think what we're seeing with ICE taking people off of our streets, deporting them without due process,

100
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,531
you know, creating fear in our communities.

101
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:29,020
Just as an example, you know, I always, because of how I look, I always carry around my passport card with me to be able to prove my citizenship.

102
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,186
I've trained my parents and their friends and tons of neighbors who don't speak English about their, you know, basic

103
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:45,551
due process rights, their rights to a lawyer and their rights to be able to, you know, navigate this really scary moment.

104
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,352
And that's a real tangible thing on the ground.

105
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,793
I mean, it's something that's really happening in Medford.

106
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:53,526
And around us.

107
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:56,788
I mean, I think two really egregious examples come to mind, right?

108
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:03,313
Like Rumesa in Somerville, who was taken for expressing her opinion in an op-ed.

109
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:09,237
She was taken off the street in Somerville, just a few streets away from Medford by Tufts.

110
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:22,624
I think of just this week, there's the 13-year-old kid in Everett who was taken to the police station and then disappeared from there all the way to Virginia.

111
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:26,206
And right now, that's a super recent case, so we don't know what's happening there.

112
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:32,109
And I think that's a really clear example of how a national issue can have a local effect.

113
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:34,811
And in order to deal with those issues,

114
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:51,487
I'm proud to have worked with Councilor Lemming and for People Power to really rush through and passed the Welcoming City Ordinance, which enshrines our non-cooperation policy when it comes to non-criminal matters with the Metro Police.

115
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:55,631
And to make sure that our residents know that they can trust

116
00:11:56,944 --> 00:12:02,089
city services that they can trust city workers when they go up to them and ask for help or report crimes.

117
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:04,812
That's just one example.

118
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:11,218
Another example is the economic effects of what's happening nationally are trickling down to us locally.

119
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,863
The Trump administration is raging a war against science.

120
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,925
So many of our residents work in science.

121
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,206
My parents are scientists.

122
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,942
And the cuts to federal grant funding mean that people are losing their jobs.

123
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:32,991
And that has another effect of making it even harder to afford living here in Medford, to afford continuing to call Medford home.

124
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:42,770
The big, beautiful bill, the so-called big, beautiful bill, is threatening our community with cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and health care service.

125
00:12:43,510 --> 00:13:00,099
And that's something, just last week, we held a city council meeting, a subcommittee meeting to deal with that, to work with our health department to create solutions and to channel resources to help residents who are really going through a tough time because of those cuts as well.

126
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:12,387
And I think that really just, you know, encapsulates my core, that core argument of why national issues can be local issues, because we feel those effects right here at home.

127
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:15,490
And, you know, when we talk about

128
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:24,079
What we normally think of as local government functions, I mean, just like, again, going back to immigration, take public safety, right?

129
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,004
When we think about what it means to really create public safety and community safety here in Medford, it means trusting our neighbors.

130
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:38,490
And it means not scapegoating, as regrettably some candidates have done, not scapegoating immigrants as criminals.

131
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,274
And that kind of rhetoric doesn't help public safety at all.

132
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:56,989
And I think this whole situation shows that that very kind of basic level of trust between neighbors is inherently tied to some of what's going on nationally as well.

133
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:11,675
Yeah, no, I think it sounds like there's been there been attempts on different levels and and like I think successful attempts on different levels for you all to sort of address the issues of like belonging in our city and equity and inclusion.

134
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:17,641
One thing that we just heard about recently was that the I think the

135
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:47,287
efforts that you all had made around like divestment um had been vetoed by the mayor um but i feel like that that issue was something that came that's been talked about a lot is like is this how is this uh well i guess like yeah maybe you could talk about how you decided that as like an important issue to take up yeah i mean um i have to be upfront in saying that that's uh you know president bears has been working really hard in that effort um in terms of writing the ordinance and working with stakeholders

136
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:55,865
Jewish, Muslim, Israeli, Palestinian, with our city staff financial team on that effort.

137
00:14:56,926 --> 00:15:02,112
And so, I can't speak too much to it, but I do know of a lot of

138
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,001
that kind of cooperation with local community stakeholders.

139
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,703
But on the divestment issue, I do want to make two points.

140
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:21,128
I think the first one is that the critique that we are just focusing on this one national issue and not tackling local issues is false.

141
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,450
It presents us with a false choice.

142
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:46,559
between focusing on local and focusing on national when in fact you know at those meetings I think it's easy to look at those meetings and look at participation public participation and see how long it took and to think you know this is all they're focusing on but at those very same meetings we pass resolutions and funding measures for our infrastructure or fire department or

143
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:53,294
We passed resolutions when it came to affordable housing and so on and so on.

144
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:57,755
So we can do more than one thing at once.

145
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:02,757
And I actually think that voters should expect us to do more than one thing at once as well.

146
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:07,558
That should be what voters expect of city government, of politicians.

147
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,579
They should hold us to a high standard with that regard.

148
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,420
And the second point I want to make

149
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:22,141
And to respond to the critique is that ultimately people want to know that their local government works.

150
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,964
They want to see government work in general.

151
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:29,211
And that means responding to their concerns and their comments.

152
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:42,110
I think that divestment is a really interesting case of this, where you might not expect it, but we did receive hundreds of emails asking us to work on divestment to pass this ordinance.

153
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:47,036
And I think that shows that a lot of community members really do care about this issue.

154
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,059
And when I first spoke about this on the city council,

155
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,206
I made the point, and I think this is really true.

156
00:16:54,226 --> 00:17:01,593
I think people are feeling like their national government, the federal government has failed them.

157
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:11,061
And then below that, they went to their state government and their state reps and their, you know, the governor, and they felt like that they were failed on that level as well.

158
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,343
And so we became the last line of defense.

159
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,365
And I think it's really important.

160
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:25,865
to build trust and legitimacy with the people, to let people know that when you come to the last line of defense, we will protect you and we will stand up for your values.

161
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,828
So those are my thoughts generally.

162
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,077
I like that a lot.

163
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:38,880
I think, too, it makes sense that there's a lot of mistrust around institutions in general right now.

164
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,122
Like, how are they going to follow these federal changes, and who's going to stand up for me, basically?

165
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:51,344
I think it's nice to have a clear sense of where folks stand in the city.

166
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:57,587
whether they are aligned with you or not.

167
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:20,717
So the other piece that I was hoping we could talk about was affordable housing and how you kind of it sounds like there's like we've heard about zoning and lots of drama around zoning and how that's like related to affordable housing and it seems like there have been a lot of efforts to address affordability like you know you all helped with this past this override there like

168
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:27,779
And I think Councilor Lemming was talking about this kind of like Swiss cheese thing where there's like all these different layers of things that you hope to address.

169
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:34,441
So I guess I'm wondering kind of what your hopes are there for how we can keep moving forward in those efforts.

170
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:41,603
Yeah, I know this has been a super hot topic in local politics here, especially this year.

171
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:46,585
And I think it's really helpful to take a few steps back and just look at the big picture first.

172
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:54,341
And I ultimately start at this kind of idea of what makes Medford special.

173
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:59,425
And to me, what has always made Medford special is diversity.

174
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:12,697
Our diversity of age, our diversity of culture and background, diversity of vocation and profession, and even diversity of ideas, and the different ideas and perspectives that we bring to the table.

175
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:16,420
And ultimately, that diversity is at stake.

176
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:24,139
Manfred is and has been facing cost of living challenges, particularly with affordable housing.

177
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,284
My parents moved to Wellington over 20 years ago because it's where they could afford a house.

178
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,487
It's where they could afford to raise me paycheck to paycheck.

179
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,749
And I look around and I look at our neighbors.

180
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,813
And now we have to pay, we're facing the prospect of extra tariffs.

181
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:47,599
that are really just taxes on us.

182
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:52,201
We're, again, facing federal cuts to health care and social services.

183
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:57,084
And, you know, people's jobs are being affected by federal cuts as well.

184
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,365
And this government shutdown that's been going on.

185
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:05,868
And then I, you know, think about myself, and, you know, I'm a young person in my 20s.

186
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,868
I love Bedford, I want to stay here, and I can't afford a house here.

187
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:12,329
I can't afford to live here.

188
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,470
And you know, even making rent is difficult.

189
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,273
I have student loans.

190
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:23,177
I've had to get surgery this year and broke an arm last year.

191
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:26,700
I have medical bills that are piling up in rent.

192
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,261
I know I'm not alone.

193
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:40,265
I have friends who, for a lot of these same reasons, are now priced out, they have to move to New Hampshire, they have to move to Worcester, just really far from their families, and you know their parents don't like that either.

194
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:46,067
Seniors who have lived here for decades can't find homes that meet their needs.

195
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,029
Young families can't want to put roots down here.

196
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:51,630
They can't afford to stay.

197
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,892
Teachers, nurses, first responders who work in the city can't.

198
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,494
And so people are being priced out and left behind.

199
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,015
The status quo hasn't been working.

200
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,657
And so the question is, how do we move forward from here?

201
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:13,105
And I believe that affordability means real changes and hard choices to protect people from being pushed out.

202
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,907
And I think of, you know, the buzzwords and what they actually mean.

203
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:21,152
I know a lot, you know, a lot of people talk about neighborhood character.

204
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,016
And yes, I think of the historic buildings.

205
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:27,241
That's really important to me because that's part of what makes us special.

206
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,843
but I also think about that diversity of the people who live in the city.

207
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:46,050
And so even though there's a wide range of views, and I certainly see that in my email inbox as a city counselor, I do think our community share is common priorities and share values when it comes to addressing these issues.

208
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,053
I think that people wanna prioritize protecting residents and small businesses from displacement.

209
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:57,295
They want us to assist them through tough times.

210
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:13,362
And they want us to build more affordable homes and inclusive neighborhoods, a lot keeping big developers and institutions accountable and so some of the, the city council through its voting efforts for particularly on Salem Street, and.

211
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:34,610
Mr. Gav, I think, you know, encouraging mixed-use units, raising affordability requirements for big developers, making sure that we are requiring more open space for developers, a lot of that has been progress, but the way I see it is that we are halfway through, or partway through this

212
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:36,593
conversation.

213
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:46,204
It's a continuous conversation that needs to continue to go forward and in reaching out to residents and knocking on doors and through phone calls and emails over the last few months.

214
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,118
I think that there are certain concrete policies that we can work on that folks generally agree on.

215
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:08,211
Updating impact and linkage fees to make developers pay their fair share, strengthening our community benefits approach by creating a new ordinance and more community input into a lot of these projects.

216
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:21,236
Continuing to push forward on requiring affordable housing and new developments with more and stronger incentive zoning and inclusionary zoning affordable housing overlays.

217
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:33,274
creating an office of housing stability to help residents who are facing eviction or displacement and to connect them with resources and provide emergency assistance.

218
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:36,717
So I see a lot of those things.

219
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,399
And you can learn more on my website.

220
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,280
I have way more policies there.

221
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:48,486
But I think that these are things, are concrete policies that residents do agree on that we can agree on moving forward.

222
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:56,210
I think it's also important to see this opportunity, housing reform, as an opportunity to do even more.

223
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,353
A lot of the, you know, there has been a lot of misinformation out there, and I just want to say on the record, we are not tearing down single-family homes.

224
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:11,937
We are not building, we're not going to set an apartment building, a six-story apartment building down in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

225
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:16,139
That's not, number one, city government can't do that, but number two, that's not what we want.

226
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:18,320
And I know that's not what residents want in the city.

227
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,684
But, you know, a lot of the concerns that residents have raised to me are very valid.

228
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:38,935
And, you know, we need to do a better job addressing those concerns and in reaching out and informing residents of what changes are to come through our housing reform process.

229
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:44,939
And we need to present, again, this opportunity, this reform process as an opportunity.

230
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,061
For example, I think

231
00:24:48,513 --> 00:25:05,730
You know, a lot of residents are worried about traffic that will come in, but the housing reform process, the zoning reform process gives us an opportunity to implement a new traffic demand management ordinance to make sure that we are incentivizing.

232
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:18,497
developers that come in with big apartment blocks on transit corridors to have ways to get their residents to Wellington Station, to Medford Tufts, Ball Square, to big bus routes as well.

233
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:29,581
Encouraging transit-oriented development as well so that we don't have to rely as much on car use and on parking spaces in the city.

234
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:40,249
This is an opportunity, like a lot of, a few residents have brought up to me, they're worried about the tree canopy and how we are, as a city, losing trees over time.

235
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:59,542
And I think this process is a really good opportunity for us to pass tree protection ordinances, to protect the trees that do exist at our neighborhood, and to use the revenue and growth that we generate from this process, you know, more businesses,

236
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:06,365
to fund the planting of more trees and better infrastructure in our city.

237
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:21,652
This is an opportunity for us to address commercial development in the city as well, because when I talk to folks who are thinking of starting businesses here in Medford, the top concern I hear is that there just aren't enough customers that live close to where they would open a business.

238
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:24,553
And so more mixed-use development would bring that in.

239
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:27,254
People have concerns about

240
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,857
Historic buildings, preserving that.

241
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:46,269
The housing reform process gives us a chance to write a new ordinance that lets people protect the exterior of their homes while updating the inside of their homes to move it from a single family to maybe a two-family residence.

242
00:26:48,409 --> 00:27:00,325
And, you know, I think a lot of residents are worried about what this means for, you know, I think there's just uncertainty about what this means for what they can do with their own property as well.

243
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,329
And this is an opportunity for

244
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:11,561
you know, families who maybe their kids have gone off to college and won't come back to Medford, but they've moved across the country.

245
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,962
And now it's two people living in a house with four rooms, right?

246
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:19,764
And a lot of those folks reach out to me and ask what they can do about that.

247
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:24,366
And this opportunity gives them the chance to

248
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:33,034
use more of those rooms, those units for affordable housing as well.

249
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:39,602
So that's just a snapshot of the opportunities that we can use, that we can generate with this process.

250
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:41,303
It doesn't have to be as

251
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:47,831
Divisive as I think some people make it out to be or certainly wanted to be.

252
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:57,642
I think that we can unite around a lot of these common goals and zoning reform gives us the opportunity to have a real number 1 conversation and.

253
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,906
That develops into a plan and then number 2.

254
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:08,733
real action to solve one of the most dire crises of our time.

255
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:13,074
And one that's not just a Medford problem, it's a regional problem, but one that we have to step up to.

256
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:19,395
And actually, this brings me slightly back to what we were talking about with larger scale issues.

257
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:27,617
I think for a very long time, this label of national issues has become almost like an excuse not to act.

258
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,498
I think for a long time, people saw

259
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:41,823
rents and, you know, high housing prices is something that wasn't a local issue because it wasn't, you know, it wasn't schools, it wasn't police, it wasn't trash.

260
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:47,826
But in fact, you know, this is something that local government can do a lot on.

261
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:54,029
And we can't use this label of national politics or state politics as an excuse not to act on it.

262
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,972
Yeah, no, I think there's like some interesting conversations about like,

263
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:05,619
What does affordable housing mean for the population of Medford?

264
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,640
Who can afford to move here versus who can't?

265
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,621
Who can afford to stay here versus who can't?

266
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,141
And how that impacts

267
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:32,420
You know, I think like the diversity of our population, and you said you couldn't afford to live here just and I couldn't afford to live here if I had to like we bought our house like 10 or 12 years ago and like, we looked at buying, we looked at a house in our same neighborhood, we couldn't afford it today like, and it's wild like how fast grown.

268
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:57,323
and like yeah I don't know it's it's uh really distressing but one point that I have heard a few times is um what would an increase in affordable housing units mean for um like the um like the student population like increase in size of schools or like just yeah class size things like that

269
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:09,254
I mean, before I say anything, I should point everyone to Jenny Graham's really well written explainer on her website.

270
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,715
I think it's on her website.

271
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:14,017
She definitely posted it on social media and through her email list.

272
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:20,540
of what we're actually seeing with school enrollment across the state, the trends over time.

273
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,041
And it's actually quite surprising.

274
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:36,469
I think what we're finding is, what the state is finding through deep social science research by experts, is that enrollment doesn't actually necessarily go up with more housing units in the city.

275
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,091
It does tend to take up with more affordable housing.

276
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:42,473
But that leads me to my next point, which is that

277
00:30:45,043 --> 00:31:05,949
I know a few school committee candidates have brought this up, but there is an imbalance in our schools, where we have one elementary school that is experiencing overcrowding, one that's not, that actually has way fewer students, and then we have two that are kind of in the middle with what we would expect for class sizes.

278
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:21,277
And so I know that the school committee is working hard, and this leadership at the public schools is working hard to develop a plan to realign that so that things are more balanced across the city.

279
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:31,420
And I want to note, too, this next city council will likely vote on whether we rebuild Harvard High School.

280
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:37,457
You know, we need at least five votes for that on the city council, if not more.

281
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:41,359
You know, this requires a really strong vote on the city council.

282
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:48,983
And that means voting leaders, voting for progressive leaders that you can trust to make that investment, to put that question to the voters.

283
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:54,706
And, you know, no matter if it's a full rebuild or a renovation, we'll have to do that.

284
00:31:55,146 --> 00:32:02,310
And so, and so I encourage voters to think about that when they think about, you know, when they cast their ballots this fall.

285
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:21,509
But in this new high school process, the building committee has really thought quite deeply about addressing a lot of these long-term vision questions when it comes to building.

286
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:25,613
And so right now, we have a high school that's weird for a city.

287
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:28,096
just to say, you know, say the least.

288
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:38,531
It was built for a time when we had about 4000 students at Medford High and now we have basically a quarter of that, just above a quarter of that student population.

289
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:40,434
And so it's not right sized.

290
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:50,302
But there are also ways to build high schools, build modern high schools, up-to-date, state-of-the-art high schools that plan for future growth to the city as well.

291
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:59,349
And so the building committee is very much considering that as well and factoring that into their plans.

292
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:07,105
I don't think I knew that part about the the intended size class size and have now.

293
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:12,506
Well, yeah, no, these are really helpful points for us to think about.

294
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,787
I'm saying move towards the election.

295
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:18,628
But is there anything that we haven't talked about that you want to make sure to mention?

296
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,509
Yeah, I mean,

297
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:36,828
I just want to really stress to our residents that this is a really crucial time in politics writ large, but also in our city's history.

298
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:47,618
We have the chance to forge a path forward that really makes us a city upon a hill, as John Winthrop said hundreds of years ago.

299
00:33:48,078 --> 00:34:06,228
You know, I think, when I think, this has been on my mind because I've been thinking about the No Kings protest that's coming up, and about, you know, what, how so much of what's happening in our world is so antithetical to our values, and the values that have gone back generations and generations, right here in Medford, Massachusetts.

300
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:13,932
And, you know, it's, right now I'm talking in these big lofty idealistic terms.

301
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:18,191
they have real-world lived impacts on the ground.

302
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:33,424
And, you know, when we say that we've made progress on schools, that we're making these record investments in schools and our streets, when we made historic progress on transparency reforms and accessibility reforms like

303
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:47,547
Creating a new city council newsletter, uploading our, you know, live streaming our meetings on YouTube and upload uploading them online after creating listening sessions with particularly with underrepresented populations.

304
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:51,068
They're working with our community liaisons and with the Medford senior center.

305
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:55,670
Yeah, those are just those are examples of how.

306
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:01,126
those lofty ideals have translated to real world action.

307
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:10,455
And it's easy to say that we shouldn't be so idealistic, or that we're losing sight of what's happening.

308
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:17,281
But the truth is, it just takes connecting our values to our mission, right?

309
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:32,022
It takes really being able to translate what those values are, what these shared goals, and building consensus around these ideas, and putting it on paper as an ordinance that we can pass, as funding bills that we can pass.

310
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:45,328
And that's why I think it's so important to continue with progressive leadership in the city, with bold leadership, with steady hands, because we can't afford to turn back.

311
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:57,706
When I grew up in Medford, when I was growing up here, City Hall was a place that felt like you got something done if you knew who to call, if you knew someone in City Hall.

312
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,441
You know, we can't afford to turn back to that status quo.

313
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:07,704
We can't afford, and Medford residents don't deserve it.

314
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:17,491
You should, you know, we deserve a city hall that functions according to our ideals of fairness, of equality, of inclusion, accessibility.

315
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:20,734
And that is at stake on the ballot this fall.

316
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:28,614
And, you know, I'm someone who can work with anyone, but it really does help to have that team.

317
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:31,556
Going back to what I was talking about in the first place.

318
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:36,419
And, you know, a team that brings really varied life experiences.

319
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,563
A team that brings varied perspectives on issues, that has worked on many of these issues before.

320
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,205
Like, I'm thinking of

321
00:36:46,025 --> 00:37:00,571
For example, like Miranda Bresenio, who has done so much work when it comes to helping small businesses out in Medford, when it comes to safe streets, when it comes to just basic infrastructure, like putting more benches along our bus routes.

322
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:09,708
Anna Callahan has been incredible at transforming our city to be a more democratic, fair, inclusive, transparent place.

323
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:13,931
And she's been doing so much on protecting our tree canopy as well.

324
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:25,579
I'm thinking of Matt Lemming, who does so much to bring science into our work, to bring data into our work, and to move forward on affordable housing goals.

325
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,461
I'm thinking of Emily Lazaro, who

326
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:43,197
you know, as, you know, working at the Malden Warming Center, has that really real-world experience working on tough issues of substance abuse, of homelessness.

327
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:58,560
Thinking of, you know, Elizabeth Lane, who knows how to bring that know-how and, you know, functionality to City Hall, who's managed these projects before and knows how to create that strategic vision for a city.

328
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:13,426
We bring in and of course you know I've already talked about President bears Zack bears is hard work but he knows how to organize and he knows City Hall, in and out, and he is an expert on these issues.

329
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,988
And this is a team you know.

330
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:41,807
I know I came on here to talk about my own campaign, but truly, so much of this progress and these policies and this vision would be for naught if we didn't have a team on the city council to work with that can work with each other, that can delegate projects and know when to tag team in and out of different projects to keep Medford progressing on all these different fronts.

331
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,648
So those are my concluding thoughts.

332
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:48,129
No, that's exciting.

333
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:53,914
I think it's exciting to think about the potential for the future and a little scary to think about all the other alternatives.

334
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,376
I was remembering one thing.

335
00:38:56,416 --> 00:39:07,845
I think this was you from like maybe a couple of years ago talking about adding different languages and different translations for the city website and just improving the city website.

336
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:09,506
And I have to say it's much better.

337
00:39:09,526 --> 00:39:10,747
Thank you.

338
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,141
We've been working hard on that.

339
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:19,143
And we've been working hard on translating a bunch of resources into different languages as well.

340
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:30,929
For example, there's a housing assistance flyer with a bunch of resources to legal aid, to links to our ordinances and rights.

341
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:33,630
We've been working hard to expand tenants' rights as well.

342
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,893
And that's been translated into all of the main spoken languages here, Spanish,

343
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:43,696
Creole, Chinese, Arabic, I'm missing a few I'm sure.

344
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:50,521
I personally work a lot with, I spend a lot of time with residents who can't speak English.

345
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:53,844
So I spent a lot of time, particularly in Spanish and Chinese.

346
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:59,606
to help people be able to navigate City Hall and outside resources as well.

347
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:07,909
So it is something that's near and dear to my heart because, again, when I was growing up, I had to help my parents through all of this stuff.

348
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:09,930
And we're only just starting.

349
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:18,973
There's so much more that we can do, especially with what's going on with immigration, what's going on with finances.

350
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:27,478
Finding jobs, being able to access financial aid for folks' kids.

351
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,899
There's a lot more that we can do at City Hall.

352
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:39,625
And we need to be able to create action plans for that and to have a team at City Hall that is intent on moving this forward.

353
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:41,786
Because it definitely takes more than one person.

354
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,674
Yeah, you got a lot of hats there, Justin.

355
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:46,836
Well, thank you so much.

356
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:48,016
It's been really informative.

357
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,100
And yeah, thanks, as always, for coming on the podcast.

358
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,881
Thank you so much for having me.

359
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,143
You know, this is it's always a great pleasure to come on.

360
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:01,687
Thank you for the work you do in informing our residents of what's going on, be it politics or non politics.

361
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:05,910
It's always, you know, really fun to listen to what's going on in town, too.

362
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:07,411
Well, thanks, Justin.

363
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:07,812
Good luck.

364
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:09,353
