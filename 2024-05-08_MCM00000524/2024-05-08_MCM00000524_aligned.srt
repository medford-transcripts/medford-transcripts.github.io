00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:06,193
Welcome to the April 18th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Chartered Study Committee.

2
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:13,215
The first order of business is the minutes from April 4th.

3
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,336
Did everyone have a chance to look at them?

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,857
I move approval.

5
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:19,697
Second.

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,178
All in favor?

7
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,418
Aye.

8
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:24,359
Okay.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,419
Excellent.

10
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:26,960
Okay.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,080
So,

12
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:42,186
Now, our next item is a short one, and I'm going to let Jean speak because we already voted on this item, but there was a question about it.

13
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:48,267
So I'm going to let Jean speak, and then we'll vote.

14
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:50,928
I asked Melva if I could bring this back to the committee.

15
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,629
And apologies, I have a cold.

16
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:11,946
It's around the budget proposal that passed city council and we had voted to not have the committee look at that proposal from the city council.

17
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:19,393
And I just wanted to bring it back to the committee and make sure we're doing our due diligence.

18
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:22,956
The city council, my understanding is city council

19
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:35,063
passed this budget ordinance, it went to the mayor who vetoed it but said she would ask the committee to review it.

20
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:43,968
And so do we feel like we adequately reviewed that ordinance?

21
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,749
We didn't spend a lot of time on it.

22
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:55,841
I know that it's contrary to state law, and it would have to be a special act to do the thing City Council wants.

23
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:04,685
And I voted against it also, so I'm recognizing that.

24
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,387
But I just wanted to make sure we

25
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,333
thoroughly considered it.

26
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:26,917
And one thing I thought that I could do is just research why federal and state legislatures can be involved in the budget, but why this doesn't happen at the local level, and bring it to the budget committee and let them discuss it.

27
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:29,498
Can I ask a question?

28
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:30,478
Sure.

29
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,999
Now, you're talking about

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,750
This was last year.

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:49,895
You're not talking about what the city council and the mayor have been working on together recently, which they've come to some kind of, I don't know, working agreement on developing something.

32
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:18,567
I understand what you want to do, but since there's a process that they're already actively kind of involved in and piloting, we want to look at that, then to go back to something that they already compromised on or in the process of compromising on.

33
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:21,650
I don't know if you follow what I'm trying to say.

34
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,210
Yeah, no, I do.

35
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,971
I just don't know.

36
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,172
I see what you're saying.

37
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:35,377
I'd be open to kind of discussing it, but I want to kind of have it updated, though.

38
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:36,477
Like, where are they now?

39
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:44,001
Is there something that's still actively in discussion between the mayor and the city council?

40
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,062
Or is this something that they're

41
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,562
already kind of working through.

42
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:59,045
Let me just say the City Council is, Pat, they've been working with the administration on a budget on an ordinance that is, I think, pretty far along in the process.

43
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:07,847
This particular question is specifically about the City Council being able to move money in the budget.

44
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:16,149
So it's a very narrow question that we would be looking at.

45
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:20,460
So, so, and then it will give the city council veto power over the man.

46
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:22,403
It would.

47
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:27,950
Yeah, that's a total amount, but they could move the money between lines.

48
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:40,525
So like if they could defund the police department, or they could move money from the fire department to the, you know, to the school.

49
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:40,766
Yes.

50
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,766
Over the administration.

51
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:43,507
Yes.

52
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:51,650
And would very, could be very conflictual with, you know, union negotiations and stuff.

53
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,572
And we saw that that was, you know, a pretty significant problem in Boston this past year.

54
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:06,028
and why would we want to revisit that if the city council isn't in the project isn't

55
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,508
I don't know if they moved on from that or not.

56
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,689
That's what I'd like to know.

57
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,090
We've already discussed it and we already voted on it.

58
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:22,374
Right now, the question is, would we like to do more research on it and then revisit it?

59
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:30,598
So that's really the only question on the table that we're going to vote on is, do we want to reopen it so that Gene can do more research?

60
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,619
And the research would really be about

61
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:43,701
State about state and federal because and maybe Boston because there's no other city in Massachusetts that can do this because it's.

62
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,767
because state law says that city councils can't.

63
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:50,069
So that's the question.

64
00:05:50,329 --> 00:06:04,378
And I've actually talked to a Boston city councilor about it and kind of what the process is in Boston and the problems they had this, you know, not this year, last year.

65
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:13,724
And, you know, I would say if we're gonna research you, won't we research you by talking to the city council and the mayor?

66
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:20,477
I mean, I'd be open to people's ideas.

67
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,718
I mean, I don't but I don't.

68
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:29,361
Well, it's just do you do you want to do you want to do you want me to do that or not?

69
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:42,486
So, OK, Eunice, you know, I see Jean's point, which I think originated and correct me if I'm wrong, Jean, but you were sort of saying that

70
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:58,028
Um, you know, the 1 of the reasons to bring this up, um, was because a lot of the feedback that we got through surveys and talking to, you know, elected and just, you know, people around that.

71
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,633
The council that both the council and the people.

72
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:14,261
The residents want a different balance of power and want the city council to have a little bit more control of the budget.

73
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,324
So I see that in 1 way of.

74
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,403
You know, and I was going to bring this up later on in a larger sense of.

75
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:27,126
You know, looking at all of the surveys and things.

76
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:35,432
Has the charter addressed as we're getting towards the finality of this has the charter addressed.

77
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,853
some of the concerns of the residents and this was clearly one of them.

78
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:51,718
So have we sufficiently addressed it and given the residents in as many places as we can, um, you know, some of the things that they've been concerned about.

79
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,839
So I see it from that point of view.

80
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:57,761
Um, I watched the city council budget meeting last night.

81
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,923
Um, they had, uh, three departments presenting their budgets.

82
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:14,234
And, you know, as they prefaced it and chief of staff Nazarian spoke last night to kind of kick the process off counselor Collins did bring up the fact that they're, you know.

83
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:27,958
Hamstrung I guess in what they can do with the budget so it continues to come up They're not hamstrung any more than any other city council in the state So to say they're hamstrung.

84
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:35,201
I'm just I just want to say they're not hamstrung because They don't get to do that um, so

85
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:37,963
They seem to think they are.

86
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:38,763
I know.

87
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:45,126
I just want to clarify because Hamstrong gives the impression that they have less power than others.

88
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:46,266
Right.

89
00:08:47,107 --> 00:09:04,094
That all being said, the fact that, you know, the largest city in the Commonwealth has tried this and it doesn't seem to be going well and that, you know, as a rule, nobody else does it, I think says plenty.

90
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:11,034
So I think in that regard, I wouldn't be for revisiting it.

91
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:23,486
Okay, Ron, I'm going to let you speak and then we're going to vote.

92
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:24,767
That's my point.

93
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,849
I don't think we're here to debate this issue.

94
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,131
I think we're here to decide.

95
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:33,996
The only thing I'm asking is if you can explain to elaborate more of what the instructions are from the mayor.

96
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,439
What's the expectations of what we're supposed to do because we've already done it.

97
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:42,825
I mean, there were the three budget amendments that the city council proposed.

98
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:47,807
I'm not going to get the date right, but it was a while back.

99
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:58,193
And she said, there's currently a charter study committee, and they will look at these issues along with the whole charter.

100
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:03,156
That's what I understand, anyway.

101
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,057
And so this was one of them.

102
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:12,902
So the question is, do we want to reopen this so that Dean can do research on it?

103
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:21,400
It wouldn't mean that you're voting to allow, you know, to say that we want to put in the charter that the city council can move money.

104
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,964
The question is, do we want to reopen the question so we can get more information?

105
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:30,707
Can I just ask if Jean is in favor of this or not?

106
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:32,509
I am.

107
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:44,693
My proposal is I'd bring it back to the budget committee and as a committee we could discuss it and we could decide as a committee whether we even bring it to the full committee or not.

108
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:57,476
The committee might look at what I present to them and say, well, this doesn't sound very strong and let's not even bring it to the full committee unless this whole committee wants to hear it.

109
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:58,817
But that's my proposal.

110
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:05,584
Okay, so that's what's on the table right now, and let's vote.

111
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:07,905
Oh, sorry, Aubrey?

112
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:16,587
Well, if you brought it back to that subcommittee, would we be able to include that information in the public presentation at the end of the whole charter?

113
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:20,287
You mean to city council, if they ask us, did we?

114
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:26,709
I think so, because it would be part of the committee minutes, and the discussion would be a public discussion.

115
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,863
Yeah, Paula.

116
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:41,670
And I think Gene is willing to do the research and, you know, and feels I never it was about the time when I was joining.

117
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,331
So, I'm not familiar with that discussion in particular.

118
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,053
So, I think if she's willing to do the work.

119
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:50,873
you know, so be it.

120
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:59,580
Well, we had the discussion and the vote, I think, a few meetings ago, where we talked about the state law.

121
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:16,233
I mean, I don't have it handy right now, but it's pretty specific where it says it accepts Boston, but it says in communities other than Boston, and it pretty specifically says that the city council can't move money.

122
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,655
So this, you know,

123
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:27,248
If the committee, if the research were done and the committee decided to put it in the charter, it would be bucking state law.

124
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:37,373
So, you know, it would, I mean, special, theoretically, a special act could make it, but it would be bucking.

125
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:39,214
So, we brought up the state law.

126
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:43,256
We talked a little bit about Boston and what was going on in Boston.

127
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:49,868
So overall, I'm not inclined to want the city council to be able to move money.

128
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,831
On the other hand, when I have a member who's asking, hey, do you mind if I do any more research into it?

129
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,771
There's something that's obviously nagging at her.

130
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,912
I'm disinclined to turn that down.

131
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:00,933
Okay.

132
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,314
So let's vote then.

133
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:10,538
So the vote is, the proposal is for Jean to do research and bring the research back to the budget subcommittee.

134
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,519
And what is exactly the research on?

135
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:24,524
I believe, Gene, you said it would be on state, why state and federal governments or bodies can move money and budgets and local governments can't?

136
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:37,973
Yeah, and I would look at what would it be specific to overriding the administration, which is exactly the only thing that's on the table because the mayor and the city council are in a in

137
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:44,600
are piloting a budget process right now for the new ordinance.

138
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,403
I mean we're going contrary to what the mayor and the city council are doing right now by Anthony

139
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:53,268
redoing this.

140
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,711
I don't, I don't, you know, I know this is something that you want to do.

141
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:01,894
So Anthony, you can vote what you can vote yes or no on whether to do that.

142
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:14,462
So on whether to go ahead with the reason I'd like to vote to be specifically for, uh, to research, uh, giving the power to the city council to veto

143
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:19,345
the administration because that's what the only thing you're researching.

144
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,326
It's not about moving money around.

145
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,266
It's about giving.

146
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,589
It's about moving money.

147
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:32,652
The motion is to reopen the subcommittee so Gene can add research.

148
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,073
If that's a yes or no.

149
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,894
The details are not.

150
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,555
So do we want to do a roll call?

151
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,376
Do we want to do a roll call vote?

152
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:41,177
Sure.

153
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:42,237
Okay, Eunice.

154
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:46,399
Will this be a budget group, or will it just be Gene individually?

155
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,260
Gene would be doing the research and bringing it back to the budget subcommittee.

156
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,841
The budget subcommittee, not to the entire group?

157
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,442
Well, eventually, it depends.

158
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:07,506
If the budget subcommittee wanted to bring it to the whole group, they would, but only if they were going to recommend something regarding what Gene found.

159
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:08,686
Eunice?

160
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:11,087
No.

161
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:13,455
Anthony?

162
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:14,656
No.

163
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:16,396
Danielle?

164
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:17,597
Yes.

165
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:19,117
Ron?

166
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:20,418
Yes.

167
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:22,719
Jean?

168
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:23,959
Yes.

169
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:25,740
Aubrey?

170
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:26,820
Yes.

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,100
Paulette?

172
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,841
Yes.

173
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:31,561
And I am no.

174
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,043
Okay, so Jean, you have a job.

175
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:37,123
Okay.

176
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:38,264
Thanks, Melody.

177
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:39,044
Yeah.

178
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:40,184
Okay.

179
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:41,945
Ron?

180
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,325
We are on a public participation question.

181
00:15:49,126 --> 00:16:05,456
I wanted to bring this up because, you know, this previous vote we just took is kind of a good example of, you know, our charge is to make sure that we're representing the third wing, not the mayor's office, not the city council.

182
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:12,080
It's the people that we're, you know, so I want to just propose a public participation subcommittee.

183
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,521
So we can listen to what the people want and make a decision based on that.

184
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:26,263
And I think we have a tendency to, my comment on this whole process is that I think we have a tendency to think that it's already defeated before we start.

185
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,503
And I disagree.

186
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:28,904
That's why I just voted yes.

187
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:35,825
I think getting gathering research and coming to the committee and then everybody gets a vote, yay or nay, is the way it should be done.

188
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:41,567
So I'm proposing that a public participation to discuss something that is, I think is a very,

189
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:48,670
complicated subject, and I think it's something that, you know, the city is feeling some pains with now.

190
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,391
I think it's our duty to at least talk about that.

191
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:55,674
So I'm suggesting a public participation subcommittee.

192
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:02,777
Okay, so does anybody have any comments before we vote on whether to form such a subcommittee?

193
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,702
You're muted, Gene.

194
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,331
I'm barely hanging in there today.

195
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:18,174
What would the committee do, Ron?

196
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:34,268
Is it looking at the charter to see how the charter could have more public participation, or is it more to go through the survey and all the comments we've gotten and double-checking against what we've decided so far and whether we're missing something?

197
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,821
No, good question.

198
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:58,459
My thought is that how we conduct meetings in the city from across the board potentially, and I don't have any preconceived notions about the results here, but I do think we should look at how do we empower citizens to have the ability to talk in a public forum, and personally, at every level, including our level here.

199
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:07,764
And I don't know what those rules are, but certainly I think people have the right and I think people are being challenged by interpretations of the right.

200
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,586
And I just like to see it hard and fast.

201
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:17,429
And, you know, it could be as loose as we decided to be, but I think it should represent the people in our charter.

202
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,410
That's just my opinion.

203
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:21,946
Okay, any other comments?

204
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:23,387
Paulette.

205
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:37,277
So Ron, the one place where I have a problem with this is that I hear people say they're not listening to us and they're not hearing us.

206
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:48,685
And I remember being at some very difficult meetings where, and at one point I sort of said, people are hearing you, they just don't agree with you.

207
00:18:50,015 --> 00:19:05,798
And I think that is a very central problem, because we could certainly talk about what's appropriate as is two minutes on one topic too short, is five minutes too long.

208
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,398
So those sort of nuts and bolts we can talk about.

209
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:15,980
But there is always going to be this tension between when people

210
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,787
who are intaking the information don't agree with the speakers.

211
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:35,336
And just because you've got a lot of speakers there, whatever the subject may be, doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to sway the people who are sitting in the seat.

212
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:42,161
So when you're asking about this, are you talking about the nuts and bolts ends?

213
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:57,838
If you just five minute versus, I'm talking about the logistics of doing it, giving everybody the opportunity to understand that when they show up, it's the city council meeting, they'll have three minutes, two minutes.

214
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:08,161
I'm not, I'm not asking that the, the, the committee, the council, the subcommittee, whatever it has to react the way they want to react.

215
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,942
All I'm asking is that in a meeting,

216
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:22,160
a public forum, you have the ability to, and we've talked about how do you get something on the agenda, but this is really talking about you have three minutes.

217
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,561
Everybody has three minutes.

218
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:28,162
And whatever other rules, this is just the structure of it.

219
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:31,644
It's not, well, they have to answer me, they're forced to answer me.

220
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:34,505
No, I just want to see it in writing.

221
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:39,867
So over the past month, we've gone from 10 minutes to five minutes to three minutes.

222
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:45,971
And I just don't, I think it should be fixed by a group that says, this is it.

223
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:53,015
Everybody gets two minutes, maximum two hours on one given agenda, whatever it is, I'm only talking nuts and bolts.

224
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:53,936
Okay.

225
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,537
Daniel, did you want to?

226
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:05,109
Yeah, so the way you're talking about Ron, it sounds like it's not already in there and we'd have to do, like.

227
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,415
For both for school committee and city council, or would it be like this?

228
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,237
Would you imagine it being the same or what?

229
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:13,985
It's a good question.

230
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:17,426
Again, I have no preconceived notion of what it should be.

231
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:32,432
All I believe is that across the board, that every one of these meetings, school committee, city council, every public forum meeting, this meeting, if we get into the weeds of a really major scenario,

232
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:38,735
If there are 50 people in the room, 50 people should be able to get up and have their fair shot at it.

233
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:42,677
And I don't know how we do that, but that's my thought.

234
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,377
How do we get that across the board?

235
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:50,400
So, and it may be, Danielle, to your question, it may be different for a school committee than city council.

236
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,101
I don't know.

237
00:21:51,121 --> 00:22:02,026
I don't have all those answers, but that's why I'm, you know, I started looking and figuring out what I wanted to, how I wanted to go, but I thought it was better to have a subcommittee do it because I think it's more.

238
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,827
Is it something that's usually in the charter?

239
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:06,908
No, no, it's not.

240
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:17,253
And that's why I'm just going to say my only comment I'm going to make is I will vote against this because it's not a charter issue to me.

241
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:27,458
The city councils and school committees make their own rules in terms of how they conduct their meetings, and that's standard.

242
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,519
And I don't think it should be in the charter.

243
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:49,554
I've been sort of looking at the list of sort of checklists that I sent you all from the National Civic League about what belongs in a charter and what doesn't, and some of the questions whether it can be solved by an ordinance, whether it's policy versus charter.

244
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:52,015
And to me, this is not a charter issue.

245
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,317
That's just how I feel about it.

246
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:55,458
Frances.

247
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:00,308
I understand what Ron is saying.

248
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:06,689
I think you're trying to provide clarity for anybody who might want to engage.

249
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,070
I heard you use the term across the board.

250
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,031
So I take that to mean our boards and commissions.

251
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:21,033
I just wanted to remind everybody that public participation is not actually written as any legal part of the

252
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,787
public meetings.

253
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:38,271
So if you would want, I can see if I can get a quick consult with a simple question that says, can a charter have public participation written into it?

254
00:23:38,611 --> 00:23:40,171
Because there's no law, right?

255
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:45,873
It's not like it will say refer to Massachusetts general law, blah, blah, blah.

256
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,594
Because I think that you have to start there.

257
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:51,555
Because if you go and you form your committee, and you

258
00:23:52,328 --> 00:24:05,319
you do all that and then you find out that you can't put something in the charter that's not state law, then you've wasted a lot of time towards the, you know, towards the end of your giant project.

259
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,146
So just trying to figure out like how I can help get some clarity before you move forward.

260
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:15,948
Thanks, Francis.

261
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,970
That could be helpful if the committee decides to go ahead with this.

262
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,652
So does anybody else have any other comments before we vote?

263
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,412
Eunice.

264
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,274
I'm in full agreement with Ron on this.

265
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:38,136
I think it's just because it's not in the charter doesn't mean that it can't be.

266
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:40,397
And I think that

267
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:53,093
Any way that we can ensure that the public has more of a voice, a stronger voice, and inserting that in the charter, I think, is important.

268
00:24:54,053 --> 00:25:02,019
I think leaving anything like this up to the bodies themselves, quite frankly, in my opinion, is the fox guarding the hen house.

269
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,843
They get to make whatever rules that they want with whatever convenience that they want.

270
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:16,441
and disguised as, you know, you know, they make their own rules.

271
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:25,787
So they can make a rule, you know, as President Bezos said at one point, that they don't even have to listen to public participation.

272
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:28,809
He can make that rule if he wishes.

273
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,232
And that completely disenfranchises the public.

274
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:34,393
I think having something in the charter where,

275
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,742
where a city that listens to the public, I think is important.

276
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:42,103
Okay.

277
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:42,803
Anthony.

278
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:51,806
I just, I think I made most of my comments last week, but just to say, you know, that would really be changing the form of government.

279
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:55,787
That would be more like having, they're changing our form of government to town meeting.

280
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:59,208
Our city council, our school committee are, are elected.

281
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,050
Uh, you know, we give them the power to make their own rules when we elect them.

282
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:04,710
It,

283
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:12,283
It's their job to have their rules, their standards, their professionalism.

284
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:24,595
It is not our role or even a charter's role to dictate how people conduct their meetings.

285
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:36,061
By the time this goes into effect, the people who are on city council now may not even be the city council members.

286
00:26:36,822 --> 00:26:45,350
And remember, the president of the city council has been able to suspend the time limit on

287
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:49,884
public participation for as long as I can remember.

288
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:55,687
And they do it often, and nobody has ever had a problem with it up until recently.

289
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:14,098
And that's, you know, I understand that, you know, there's been some conflicts in the city council, but, you know, that, you know, things change, and over time, and, you know, there's ebb and flow of public participation.

290
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:16,341
We can't regulate that.

291
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:34,108
I know you want to, and I know you're doing this in goodwill, and it's for the citizens and for the community, and I applaud you for what you want to do, but I really don't think we can do it.

292
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:40,610
It's not our place, not our role, and I can't imagine that

293
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:51,078
that this could ever go forward, that the city council, the mayor, or the state legislature would ever allow something like this to be in the charter.

294
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:59,982
Because they're elected, and we can't tie their hands by charter.

295
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:06,164
I think we can only use our vote to make change.

296
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:09,405
And I think that's the way our system's set up.

297
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:15,030
And I'll shut up, but I understand and I support you and what you're trying to do.

298
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,355
I just don't think we can do it.

299
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:18,456
Okay, thank you, Anthony.

300
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:21,977
All right, I want to go ahead and vote, but Ron, did you have one more thing you wanted to say?

301
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,658
Yeah, I just want to respond to that.

302
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:37,905
You know, the thought that we are powerless is not true because in our charter we have, if you can't get something on the agenda through the correct process, we have a roundabout way for citizens to gather signatures to do that.

303
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,706
So we're not powerless.

304
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:45,188
And part of my, and again, I haven't said one word about how I think this should go.

305
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:53,231
All I'm saying is that our charge from the city is to investigate all options and to listen to all options.

306
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:56,632
I don't believe we've done that in this regard on this process.

307
00:28:57,012 --> 00:29:04,155
And the subcommittee can have a discussion and the simple results could be, let's make sure that an ordinance is created

308
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:06,936
by the city council at the beginning of each term.

309
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:08,317
That's a rule.

310
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,579
So I mean, those things can happen.

311
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:16,482
And I just don't, I don't think it's fair to say it's impossible to happen without having a discussion and running it up the flagpole.

312
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:18,243
So that's where I stand on it.

313
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:27,788
I mean, I don't, I'm not saying how it should be done could be as simple as saying they must create an ordinance in their plan to allow for or not allow.

314
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:30,610
They could say, they have a 10 second rule.

315
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,812
Well, as long as that's in writing, that's what I'm asking for.

316
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:35,657
It already is wrong.

317
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:36,597
OK.

318
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:38,938
I want to go ahead and vote on this.

319
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:40,839
Paulette, do you have one more comment?

320
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:41,619
Yes.

321
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,681
Throughout the school committee subcommittee, this topic has been on.

322
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:52,444
And I've always referred it because we talked about talking about it as a whole committee rather than the subset of school committee.

323
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:59,588
So I would feel disingenuous not to now say, yes, we should take a look at it, whatever the result may be.

324
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:09,111
I just feel like we've consistently said we would take a look at it with the whole committee, or that's what the impression was, so.

325
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:23,896
Okay, so the vote that we're about to take is on whether should we form a subcommittee to look into how public participation is handled at public meetings.

326
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:26,177
Is that accurate, Ron?

327
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:29,478
Yes.

328
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:30,342
Okay.

329
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:31,663
Eunice.

330
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:32,644
Yes.

331
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:34,726
Aubrey.

332
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:37,368
No.

333
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:39,029
Ron.

334
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:40,770
Yes.

335
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:41,871
Danielle.

336
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:43,833
No.

337
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:46,134
Anthony.

338
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,315
No.

339
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:48,516
Paulette.

340
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:49,257
Yes.

341
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:50,558
Jean.

342
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:09,799
I'm gonna say yes, but I would hope the committee looks at things like principles we can put in the preamble or I'm concerned about the specifics of dictating minutes or getting into the details.

343
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:14,422
And if that came before me, I would vote no against those kinds of provisions.

344
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:16,523
I'm voting no.

345
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:20,746
So we actually, since we only have eight members here, we now have a tie.

346
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:25,026
And I'm not exactly sure.

347
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,149
I guess we're going to have to bring it to the next meeting.

348
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,690
So the motion fails, isn't it?

349
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:32,292
If there's a tie vote, the motion fails?

350
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:36,555
Unless you want to table it for reconsideration.

351
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:39,137
I don't know exactly how it works.

352
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,899
Is that how it works?

353
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,521
If it doesn't pass, it fails.

354
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:49,645
And if you could table it for reconsideration at another meeting.

355
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,561
Is there any harm to have Frances go ahead and do the piece that she volunteered to do?

356
00:31:54,581 --> 00:32:06,185
I mean, I feel like we already heard from the Collins Center that there's nothing prohibiting putting it in the charter.

357
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:14,068
They don't advise it because it's not really a charter issue.

358
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,430
Well, according to my recollection,

359
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:23,405
is if it's the motion fail, if it's a die vote.

360
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,146
I could be wrong, but that's what my recollection is.

361
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:29,607
OK.

362
00:32:31,888 --> 00:32:37,189
I mean, we can bring it when we have three members that aren't here.

363
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,851
So let's table it and we'll see.

364
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,992
I believe a couple of members might show up later.

365
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,940
We'll table it for now.

366
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:51,341
Okay.

367
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,381
Do you mean table it for later in the same meeting?

368
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:54,902
I'm sorry?

369
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:57,563
Do you mean table it for later in the same meeting?

370
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,283
We'll table it until the next meeting.

371
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:00,904
How's that?

372
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:04,184
Motion to table it.

373
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,045
All in favor?

374
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,686
Aye.

375
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:11,847
Okay.

376
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,367
It's tabled until the next meeting.

377
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:14,847
Now, we're on.

378
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:22,479
articles two and three, which we've spent a good amount of time talking about last meeting.

379
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,764
And so what I asked is for people to, because we have to get through this material.

380
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:40,472
So I asked if people have specific proposals that they want to make regarding this text, bring them and I'll bring it up.

381
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:43,673
I have a clarification.

382
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:45,634
I wasn't here the last time.

383
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:52,897
So in the first paragraph, it says, if the city has 10 or more wards, there should be either two or three counselors.

384
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,398
So it's an odd number.

385
00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:00,701
The beginning, it shall consist of 11 members.

386
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,442
Is it the assumption that it's eight wards?

387
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:04,963
Yes.

388
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:09,919
Well, I think it ought to say eight wards and three large members.

389
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,020
I don't think it defines that.

390
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,941
And then you've got the question is, well, what happens if it becomes nine wards?

391
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,781
And if it's nine wards?

392
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,622
Well, it says each ward shall have a single ward counselor.

393
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:23,903
So.

394
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:24,523
OK.

395
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,464
So if it was nine, then it would be 11.

396
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:27,404
OK.

397
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:29,564
If it's 10, it would be 13.

398
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:31,345
But it doesn't say eight.

399
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:44,640
Right, so this language, you know, when the call and center reviews this language, they might say you need to say this to make it clear.

400
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,581
I mean, we pretty much we voted on.

401
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:54,807
eight ward and three at large, because we currently have eight wards, and the subcommittee was concerned about wards.

402
00:34:55,087 --> 00:35:05,774
So I feel confident that when the call-in center looks at this, they're going to be able to tweak the language to have it say what it needs to say based on what we decided.

403
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:06,935
Does that make sense?

404
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:07,275
Okay.

405
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:09,617
Yeah, I'm just saying it doesn't say it in it.

406
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,819
Yeah, no, I understand.

407
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:13,440
Okay, Jean.

408
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:17,963
Yeah, just that's my comment and the document is.

409
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:26,286
There's just inconsistencies about how we talk about the number of counselors in the wards and and what happened.

410
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:31,688
So but if you mean later, you mean another in other.

411
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:33,509
I think in Article 7.

412
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,010
We just need to tighten up the language.

413
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,411
Obviously I think the call center will do that.

414
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,572
They definitely will help with that.

415
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:43,112
Yeah.

416
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:45,049
Okay, Aubrey.

417
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:48,850
It's a process question because I don't think I understand how it works.

418
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:55,053
So we will vote on these and then the call and center will review and then we'll bring back to us for a final

419
00:35:56,177 --> 00:36:12,705
Yeah, that's what I would like the Collins Center to do is to read it because there may be some language in here that, you know, maybe says something that we didn't want to say or that they'll say, well, you know, flag this or clarify this or whatever.

420
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:15,306
And then that's the plan.

421
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:25,765
Okay, so do we have any specific proposals on this text?

422
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,207
Or... Where did we leave off?

423
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:46,432
Well, we left... I don't know exactly where we left off, but my request was for everybody to review the document and come with a specific proposal, and then we will vote on those proposals, if any, and then we will vote on the text.

424
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:47,753
Okay.

425
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,433
So does anybody have any specific proposals?

426
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:00,728
I have a couple.

427
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:09,413
So I have a concern about, and this actually came up on the school committee one, two, when I was writing the filling of vacancies.

428
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:27,104
I don't know whether it's standard practice that if a candidate becomes appointed, that immediately of the day of the election, the next, the person who elected fills out the remainder of the term.

429
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,105
That just seemed like,

430
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:38,513
So we just had somebody on the school committee come in, who has come in in March, I think it was.

431
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:41,976
Now, he was the next in line.

432
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:44,859
So I guess because he was the next in line, he was elected.

433
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:48,242
So maybe it doesn't matter if he was appointed

434
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:59,103
He could be, he could serve on the, for almost the entirety of the, of the term.

435
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:05,166
And then on election day, automatically he would be out and not fulfill the final six weeks.

436
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,947
It just struck me as being odd.

437
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,653
Are you talking about this section right here?

438
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:18,356
So are you just doing two?

439
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,977
Oh, that's council president, sorry.

440
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,938
2-10, I think.

441
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:23,039
Yeah.

442
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,861
So which section?

443
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,122
This is down at the end.

444
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:28,924
You said the whole thing, so I was doing two at the end.

445
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:31,866
Yeah.

446
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:34,028
OK.

447
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,511
I was doing 2-10.

448
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:40,012
Right.

449
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:40,473
Or 2-10-9.

450
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,762
Are you talking about letter C?

451
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:49,646
Hold on here.

452
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:49,646
210.

453
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,871
Yes, 210C.

454
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:10,843
Now, it is in the case that there's nobody to fulfill a seat.

455
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:39,210
You know, I feel like there might be some confusing language here that the Collins Center is going to help us with because you're talking about where it says a person elected by the city council to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next regular election at which time the vacancy shall be filled by the voters and the person who chose to fill the vacancy shall

456
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:47,352
So what it's saying is election day comes, okay?

457
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:59,437
And the person has served as, for instance, AJ, Aaron, for almost two years, and all of a sudden, election day comes, and he would be told no.

458
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:09,862
And- Because, but only, this would only apply to a person who is basically appointed by the city council and not elected.

459
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:18,819
Right, but I'm still is it if it's that early so in when I wrote it for school committee we'll see later I was says, if it happens in the first year.

460
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:26,648
then the person should be, you know, be able to fill out the term and can have candidate for reelection next to their term.

461
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:29,451
And if it happens in the second year, then they don't.

462
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:37,097
I mean, it just sort of seems like if someone's put all that effort in for almost the whole term, I just found it a very strange thing.

463
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:38,238
And I know that it's in others.

464
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:38,858
I saw that.

465
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,180
I just, it struck me as odd.

466
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:49,318
So we can just listen to that if my saying, hey, I find this kind of odd and then we can send it to the call and center and.

467
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:54,727
Well, do you want to say that that it should be different?

468
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,289
I mean, we can look at that.

469
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:11,700
I mean, this particular situation we're talking about is a situation where there is not a person who ran who is taking a seat.

470
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:21,628
This is a person who was appointed by the city council because there were no candidates that ran that could fill the vacancy.

471
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:28,153
I think that makes sense to keep it like that, because I think it's like reminding the voters that this person was appointed, not elected.

472
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:29,145
Right?

473
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:35,128
Yeah, basically, I think it's saying, okay, now that we have a person who was elected, they're gonna go right in.

474
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:41,372
And so we're reminding us when we vote the next time that we didn't actually vote for that person into the position.

475
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:44,013
Is that right?

476
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:47,255
Yeah.

477
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:53,919
And instead of waiting, it means they would go in right in November instead of waiting till January.

478
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:10,409
The thing that is odd to me, though, is how do you know which person who won?

479
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:11,991
What if there's two open seats?

480
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:13,273
I don't know.

481
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:19,689
how do you know which person is gonna take over right away for the person who was appointed?

482
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:20,829
Does that make sense?

483
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,130
Yes, exactly.

484
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:22,851
Okay.

485
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:25,713
If it's Ward, it's easier, but yeah.

486
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:26,733
Right, exactly.

487
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:28,915
I'm just saying there's a lot of gray around this.

488
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:29,655
Yeah.

489
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:35,819
And when we get to the school committee one, you'll see how I wrote it just to try and- Okay.

490
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,581
Eunice.

491
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:41,183
My question in this particular section,

492
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:44,280
just trying to read here.

493
00:42:44,300 --> 00:43:01,010
If there's a vacancy and there's no next person up, so to speak, then it looks like the remaining members of the city council shall elect a person to fill the vacancy.

494
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:05,012
My question is, elect from where?

495
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:10,536
Just the 40,000 registered voters, they can pick one?

496
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:21,459
When people are appointed, it doesn't specify they can choose.

497
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:24,902
Okay.

498
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:29,966
So they can choose anybody in Medford?

499
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:32,328
Okay.

500
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:33,789
Pretty much, Jean.

501
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,893
I'm assuming they could only choose people that could run for office.

502
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:39,958
Yeah.

503
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:42,800
They would have to have the regular eligibility.

504
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,500
Right.

505
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,101
Yeah.

506
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,322
Is the ward piece of that waived at that point?

507
00:43:52,985 --> 00:44:03,590
Well, the ward is in letter B. But I think... No, it's in C2.

508
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:04,731
Yeah.

509
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,892
You mean, could they appoint someone who doesn't live in the ward?

510
00:44:07,952 --> 00:44:08,713
Is that what you're saying?

511
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:09,722
Right.

512
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:15,405
I would imagine they would pick somebody who lived in the ward.

513
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:18,747
I mean, otherwise it wouldn't be a ward representative.

514
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,048
But what if there's nobody available?

515
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:30,760
no one available in the ward period, well, then they would, yeah, they would have to find somebody to serve.

516
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:42,586
You know, when you look through the general laws and every reading about filling vacancies, when they're talking about wards and they're talking about not having a candidate to pick, they don't pick.

517
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:46,168
You're saying they just leave the seat open?

518
00:44:46,976 --> 00:45:02,200
Yeah, I think that the strategy is that if you'd sell a ward that you're gonna have nobody representing the ward and we're leaving that open, their expectation is that someone will step up and walk in because that's all you would have to do is raise your hand at that point.

519
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,561
So they don't leave the seat open.

520
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:11,882
They do leave the seat, they wouldn't give it to somebody outside the ward.

521
00:45:12,522 --> 00:45:12,742
Right.

522
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:19,367
So they would leave it open until somebody from the ward says, okay, I'll do it.

523
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:34,259
That's the way I read all the mass general law pieces of when a vacancy needs to be filled and they don't meet the criteria, they leave it pressuring the citizens to come up with a candidate.

524
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:39,928
If you have references, I would like to see those.

525
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,789
Oh, look, it's in the Mass General Laws.

526
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,831
I read it a while ago, but I'll get it for you.

527
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:53,033
It would be interesting to know if there's some type of nomination, who gets to nominate.

528
00:45:54,914 --> 00:46:04,418
Joe Smith and Charlie Brown, do city councilors individually come up with somebody, or does the mayor?

529
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:14,442
Like, do they choose from, I mean, like, do they have, like, the mini election in the city council?

530
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:18,685
Or do they just, you know, come up with one name out of a hat?

531
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:26,129
And it's, I'd like to know a little bit more about that myself, because I think we might run into those kind of problems.

532
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,813
Because, you know, we don't know how, like, wards will react.

533
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:33,074
We don't know who lives in each ward.

534
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:34,455
There might be wards where, you know,

535
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:47,296
there's no politicians, you know, so it's information I think we, you know, could be useful to kind of understand what that might look like.

536
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:57,306
Well, it sounds to me, so I haven't heard any sort of specific proposals for how to change this, so I'm going to just put it in Highlighter so that

537
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:05,627
It's a section that we might want to revisit and get some help with from the Collins Center.

538
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:06,788
Does that make sense?

539
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:07,908
Sounds good.

540
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:10,630
Yeah.

541
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,190
OK.

542
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:15,593
I had two points, two seven.

543
00:47:17,994 --> 00:47:18,915
What did I say there?

544
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:20,476
I wanted to align.

545
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:21,616
Oh, I wanted to add.

546
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:31,598
Under staff where the council may establish additional council support positions and consultants by ordinance.

547
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,982
I wanted to add subject to appropriation.

548
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:41,444
Does anybody?

549
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,087
So we vote on that?

550
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:47,969
Could you repeat it, Myrna?

551
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:49,430
I just want to add to this.

552
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,431
Highlight it?

553
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:54,493
Yeah, this part right here, staff.

554
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:13,820
I think you could just put it at the beginning and just say subject to appropriation, the council may establish additional council support positions and consultants by ordinance as a council, or we could say by ordinance and subject to appropriation.

555
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,701
It could go either way.

556
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:26,867
Basically, this gives the city council the ability to hire staff, but I think we should say subject to appropriation because

557
00:48:29,023 --> 00:48:29,943
because it involves money?

558
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:43,909
I guess the question would be the next paragraph talks about salaries, and are they able to get a line item for staff salaries that they can juggle around to make room for another person?

559
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:45,290
I don't know how that works.

560
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,192
Well, that would be the appropriation part.

561
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:50,032
Right.

562
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:51,493
That's why I say it should be there.

563
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:52,313
Yeah.

564
00:48:53,754 --> 00:48:55,534
I'll make a motion that we vote on that.

565
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:56,715
Okay.

566
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,234
So I can't, who's, anybody second?

567
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:02,875
I'll second.

568
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:12,442
Okay, so the motion is that we add to this section on staff, add the words subject to appropriation.

569
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:15,524
Okay, so let's see.

570
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:16,765
Anthony?

571
00:49:18,226 --> 00:49:18,467
Yes.

572
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:20,708
Danielle?

573
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:21,909
Yes.

574
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,091
Ron?

575
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:25,272
Yes.

576
00:49:27,828 --> 00:49:28,268
Paulette?

577
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:28,989
Yes.

578
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:30,749
Eunice?

579
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:33,490
Yep.

580
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,271
I can't see everyone anymore because I'm sharing my screen.

581
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:37,972
Who am I missing?

582
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:39,272
Great, yes.

583
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:41,133
Jean?

584
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:42,093
Yes.

585
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:43,834
And then me.

586
00:49:43,974 --> 00:49:44,234
Yes.

587
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:45,254
Okay, great.

588
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:47,795
So we'll just add that in.

589
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:49,536
What happened?

590
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:52,097
Here we go.

591
00:49:53,177 --> 00:49:55,678
The only other question I had

592
00:49:56,845 --> 00:49:57,946
I don't know why this isn't.

593
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:00,628
There we go.

594
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:06,673
Was 3-7.

595
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:11,897
Let's see.

596
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:15,801
3-7.

597
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:24,208
When the part about acting mayor,

598
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:35,725
where it said the city council by the affirmative vote of eight members may determine whether the mayor is unable to perform the duties of the office.

599
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:44,147
That just sounded, I felt like that should be deleted because it sounds a little explosive.

600
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:56,892
Although, I can't tell whether it's referring to the acting mayor.

601
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,870
or not, and that's, I guess I'm confused by it.

602
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:07,432
So, that's why I thought maybe take it out.

603
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:12,413
It looks like the beginning is talking about the existing mayor not being able to fulfill the duties.

604
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:15,393
Then an exacting mayor would be appointed.

605
00:51:19,674 --> 00:51:22,795
I mean, it's hard to say what the reasons would be to be

606
00:51:24,486 --> 00:51:33,989
So are we talking about after, so this is sentence is talking about after the 60 days, then the city council decides whether to keep that person.

607
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,350
Where do you see 60 days?

608
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:46,333
Where it says the president of the city council shall appoint an acting mayor from among the city council or department heads to hold that role for no more than 60 days.

609
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:47,314
Okay.

610
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:52,656
So I'm just, it feels, it doesn't feel clear to me.

611
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:56,795
And I had another question regarding that.

612
00:51:57,196 --> 00:52:01,696
It says the president of the city council shall appoint an acting mayor from among the city council.

613
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:04,277
Can he or she appoint themselves?

614
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:07,338
Probably.

615
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,918
Or department heads.

616
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:14,719
Well, OK.

617
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:21,001
So if the city council president appoints themselves,

618
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:26,501
There's no vote taken or anything else like that, does it?

619
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:34,027
No, this gives the President of the City Council the power to do it during a temporary absence.

620
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,549
There's also the section about vacancy, which is different.

621
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:38,310
Right.

622
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:44,034
Well, I just think it should be clear, that question about appointing themselves, I would

623
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:48,348
can appoint themselves or whatever.

624
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:54,811
To me, since it doesn't say they can't, they can, but if you think it should be added in.

625
00:52:54,831 --> 00:53:00,954
Because they're from among the city council, right?

626
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:01,795
Yeah.

627
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:02,095
I don't know.

628
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:09,154
just the fact that there's no other collab, there's no vote, there's no other collaboration, it's a very unilateral move.

629
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:23,926
I think that that's what we mean, that whoever's the city council is automatically, I think we should say it, that there's... Say that the president of the city council shall appoint an acting mayor.

630
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:28,524
from among the city council or department heads?

631
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,685
What are we saying exactly?

632
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:43,649
Shall appoint an acting mayor from among the city, including him, her, themselves?

633
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:49,111
I mean, I don't know.

634
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:52,512
If it's good to everybody else and your guys aren't worried about it, that's fine.

635
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:56,264
I think it's clear that it could include the president.

636
00:53:56,524 --> 00:54:00,426
What I find unclear is the next sentence.

637
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:09,051
So I guess I would like to hear how other people are reading that, if it's just me that finds it unclear.

638
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:14,260
Can you read it out loud, please?

639
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:31,644
So first, whenever, by reason of sickness or other cause, the mayor is unable to perform the duties of the office, the president of the city council shall appoint an acting mayor from among the city council or department heads to hold that role for no more than 60 days.

640
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:38,906
The city council, by the affirmative vote of eight members, may determine whether the mayor is unable to perform the duties of the office.

641
00:54:41,556 --> 00:54:43,537
That sentence should come before the other sentence.

642
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:45,358
Yeah, you're right.

643
00:54:46,918 --> 00:54:56,002
The mayor may, of their own authority, declare themselves temporarily unable to perform the duties of the office, notwithstanding any general or special law.

644
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:59,763
To the contrary, the vote shall be taken in public session by a roll call vote.

645
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:05,226
The mayor may at any point declare themselves able to perform the duties of office, ending the role of acting mayor.

646
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:07,947
So that

647
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:19,718
So Paulette, you're saying the city council, and what about then the sentence, the mayor may have their own authority to declare themselves town brewery-enabled?

648
00:55:19,738 --> 00:55:20,739
Those should go first.

649
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:32,664
Why don't you first say how the absence would happen, and then I would actually separate it by a new paragraph saying how, you know, first you would write,

650
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:36,240
what constitutes the absence of the mayor?

651
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,042
Well, it says by reason of sickness or other cause, so.

652
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:49,569
Yeah, but then you have the city council by the affirmative vote may determine whether the mayor is unable to perform the duties.

653
00:55:49,689 --> 00:55:52,892
Yeah, that's the sentence that I'm suggesting we take out.

654
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:59,597
I think it's confusing because it's not clear if that applies to the acting mayor or to the mayor.

655
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:00,637
Right.

656
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:02,739
I can imagine the scenario.

657
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:19,675
where if a mayor forbid to be in a car accident or something and unable to say for themselves that they are not able to perform their duties, that the city council would then be able to vote on their behalf and say they're not able to do their duty.

658
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:21,816
Yes, I think that was the intention.

659
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:30,823
But I can see, maybe your concern is like they may determine this by just some other matter of opinion.

660
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:42,274
Yeah, but you know, now that I look at it, when it says the mayor can declare themselves able to perform the duties, that sort of makes it, you know.

661
00:56:43,994 --> 00:56:45,934
Yeah, I mean, I think you're looking at two different things.

662
00:56:46,014 --> 00:57:00,477
Either the mayor can decide for him or herself that they're unable to perform, or the city council can determine that the mayor is unfit for duty for whatever reason.

663
00:57:01,648 --> 00:57:03,068
Um, right.

664
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:06,710
And if the mayor says they are fit, then they are.

665
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,410
Yeah.

666
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:08,870
Okay.

667
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:14,872
So now that I'm really reading it again, I, I, I change, I'm, I'm okay with it.

668
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:17,453
I'm, uh, I take back my proposal.

669
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:17,953
Sorry.

670
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:24,357
Okay, does anybody have any other proposals on this text?

671
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:34,206
The only thing that's confusing in this section in we should ask the call-in center is I kind of think that they're not actually detailing the powers of the mayor.

672
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:38,069
I mean, I understand it's a short, it's short term.

673
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,111
Acting mayor?

674
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:41,012
Yes, right.

675
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:49,198
Like the acting mayor, if anything emergency-wise that would happen, that the acting mayor would have to act.

676
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:53,622
But certainly not, it doesn't, you know, there's no negotiating of contracts.

677
00:57:53,642 --> 00:58:01,429
There's no, it seems like a very small paragraph that talks about, unless the general law is covered in more detail.

678
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,372
What do you think should be added?

679
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:16,913
Well, I mean, I'm thinking that no contracts, the acting mayor has no negotiating power on contracts.

680
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:23,019
I would think that that's... Well, they can't make a permanent appointment or removal from city service.

681
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,361
Right.

682
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:31,307
And I think that, and I don't know, I mean, if there was ever a point where they just, obviously, we extend...

683
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:35,334
you know, employee contracts forever around here.

684
00:58:35,354 --> 00:58:43,378
So maybe that's not a factor, but I just think it's a very simplistic paragraph that says, you know, I don't want to leave anything.

685
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,000
And the Collins Center would be able to tell us if that's true or not.

686
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,921
I just don't want to be.

687
00:58:48,921 --> 00:59:01,248
You may get, you know, you may get a, you know, somebody moving into the role temporarily that enjoys the power and wants to do all sorts of things.

688
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:03,718
Well, yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be able to do.

689
00:59:03,738 --> 00:59:05,599
That's why I'm asking what the call and send it to limit.

690
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:15,684
The other thing too is to me on the surface, the appointment of an acting mayor, I think would have to be approved by the city council, but it doesn't seem like that's the way it is.

691
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:17,945
Well, are you making that proposal?

692
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:27,430
I, you know, I don't just, when I read it, I'm saying one person chooses the Spanish department head and there's no,

693
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:35,779
I just think for the benefit of everybody, the city council should be able to, by even a simple majority, approve that.

694
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:44,683
We approve the city clerk, we approve the messenger, we include all the other, seems like that would be one we'd want to at least get a majority vote.

695
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:46,443
So do you want to propose that?

696
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:47,324
I would.

697
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:49,885
I agree with that.

698
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:50,905
Aubrey?

699
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:54,387
If we did that, I'd want it to be as

700
00:59:55,844 --> 01:00:01,507
lower bar as reasonable because in an emergency situation, you don't want to create.

701
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:02,287
Yes.

702
01:00:03,347 --> 01:00:03,788
Agree.

703
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:11,491
That's why I meant when I said simple majority, I don't think it has to be a super majority, then it becomes too much.

704
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:24,177
Could you do it so that the city council president appoints someone and then within two weeks, it's confirmed to buy or does that make it too complicated?

705
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:31,053
The only thing that would make it complicated is those two weeks when the person's appointed and then they don't confirm.

706
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:33,135
And then they'd have to come up with a new one.

707
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:40,320
I mean, to me, then they have to agree on a person to even vote on.

708
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:47,246
Well, I would hope that the city council would have some say in the choice anyways, but

709
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:56,795
Yeah, I just, I feel like it just is a protection that, you know, common sense would prevail, but a simple majority seems to be fair.

710
01:00:57,976 --> 01:01:10,501
So you're proposing that we add, take out the president of the city council and say the city council by a simple majority shall appoint an acting mayor?

711
01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:15,583
No, I would say that the president appoints, the majority confirms.

712
01:01:16,658 --> 01:01:19,119
That's how I would, that's how I see it.

713
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:24,522
I wouldn't say, I would say that city councilor, president of the city council still chooses the person.

714
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:35,888
Oh, and then, so the president of the city council shall appoint an acting mayor from among the city council or department heads to hold that role.

715
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:41,190
Subject to confirmation of the city council by majority vote.

716
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:43,992
Okay, so that's the proposal on the table?

717
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:46,144
That's what I would say.

718
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:47,845
I second that.

719
01:01:49,246 --> 01:02:08,398
Example, if it was during budget season, and just say, God forbid, the mayor was not available, you'd want somebody in there that has at least the support of a majority of the city council to make a major decision like that, because by

720
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:15,027
By state law, the budget has to go into effect.

721
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:20,533
So you just don't want one person making that decision.

722
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:32,967
And on the positive side of that, just to add to what Anthony says, having the backing of the city council will help the acting mayor be a more powerful force to do what they need to do.

723
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:37,545
So yeah, I mean, we're going to vote on it.

724
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:41,787
But my thought is, you know, this would be an emergency situation.

725
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:43,407
This would be very temporary.

726
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:49,890
And the acting mayor has limited powers anyway.

727
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,551
So I'm OK with it the way it's written.

728
01:02:54,692 --> 01:02:55,732
But let's vote on it.

729
01:02:57,821 --> 01:03:10,104
Okay, so we're voting on whether to have the city council confirm by a simple majority the person appointed to acting mayor by the city council president.

730
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:12,365
Does that make sense?

731
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:13,385
Yes.

732
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:18,146
Somehow you got to put in their entire council, which means the president would have a vote on the confirmation too.

733
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:26,506
Well, he's part of the, he or she is part of the council, so, or they.

734
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:32,469
I just wouldn't want it to be confusing that the president appoints but doesn't have a vote.

735
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:33,289
He does have a vote.

736
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,670
He or she doesn't have a vote.

737
01:03:37,631 --> 01:03:37,951
Okay.

738
01:03:38,011 --> 01:03:39,452
I mean, we can make sure that's part of it.

739
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:41,593
Collin Central will fix that, but we can move the vote.

740
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:41,793
Okay.

741
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:45,354
So, does everybody understand what we're voting on?

742
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:46,435
Yes.

743
01:03:47,226 --> 01:03:47,466
Okay.

744
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:47,686
Yes.

745
01:03:47,886 --> 01:03:49,807
And can the president nominate him or herself?

746
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:50,828
Yes.

747
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:53,669
Is that clear?

748
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:55,810
That usually happens.

749
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:00,491
It's clear it says from among the city council or department heads.

750
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:03,893
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to catch up quickly to read the whole thing through.

751
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:05,373
Okay.

752
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:07,134
Ron?

753
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:10,155
Yes.

754
01:04:11,236 --> 01:04:11,556
Okay.

755
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:11,956
Eunice?

756
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:12,696
Yes.

757
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:14,637
Danielle?

758
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:15,798
Yes.

759
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:17,195
Dean.

760
01:04:18,556 --> 01:04:18,836
Yes.

761
01:04:21,018 --> 01:04:21,418
Phyllis.

762
01:04:22,198 --> 01:04:22,558
Yes.

763
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:24,980
Aubrey.

764
01:04:26,021 --> 01:04:28,962
No.

765
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,143
Anthony.

766
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:31,284
Yes.

767
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:35,466
I'm missing one person.

768
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:36,187
Who am I missing?

769
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:38,460
Paulette, thank you.

770
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:39,241
Yes.

771
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,165
Phyllis is here now.

772
01:04:41,826 --> 01:04:42,568
She voted yes.

773
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:44,552
I'm voting no.

774
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:46,515
So that passes.

775
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,992
I have one more question, Milva.

776
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,093
Yeah.

777
01:04:53,453 --> 01:05:13,848
Again, on the compensation pieces that are in this entire thing, I know that at some point we had talked about writing about having a separate committee to set compensation or maybe to suggest compensation, but I don't see any of that.

778
01:05:14,688 --> 01:05:15,148
in here.

779
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:23,353
So I understand maybe it was purposely not put in here, but we had talked about it.

780
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:42,045
Yes, that will go in another section because what we will be doing is putting something in the charter that says that the city council will by ordinance form, if I'm understanding it correctly, that they will

781
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:52,394
There will be a recommendation to form a compensation committee to review salaries, but that committee won't have any decision-making power on salaries.

782
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:55,677
The city council would still have to pass the salaries by ordinance.

783
01:05:56,317 --> 01:05:56,598
Okay.

784
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:58,479
But it would be an advisory body.

785
01:05:59,240 --> 01:05:59,600
Thank you.

786
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,902
That would do the work.

787
01:06:02,443 --> 01:06:03,804
But it goes in another section.

788
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:06,426
I believe it will go in Article 5.

789
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:15,305
I mean, that's something again that we have already voted on and I, and we have all the notes on and the column center will write it up for us.

790
01:06:16,026 --> 01:06:21,391
No, but just 1 question when he was scrolling through there, the highlighted stuff you've covered all that right.

791
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,295
There's some highlights and yellow, you know, there were some.

792
01:06:27,057 --> 01:06:27,437
So, this.

793
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:35,911
This was, where's that blue, this part was, I think Daveed's not here, but I believe he had a question about that.

794
01:06:36,431 --> 01:06:42,536
And I think, if I'm recalling correctly, he said that he thought it was okay to leave it in.

795
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:43,116
So.

796
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,137
Okay.

797
01:06:44,618 --> 01:06:48,160
I think some of the yellow came from me.

798
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,622
I don't know, maybe we don't have time to go through it, so.

799
01:06:51,203 --> 01:06:55,406
Well, this is the time to make any proposals.

800
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:58,663
Okay, then can we go back to section 2-6?

801
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:03,905
Okay, this was a question about the school committee salary.

802
01:07:07,886 --> 01:07:13,068
Okay, 2-6, access to information.

803
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:17,969
Okay, I'm just kind of reading my notes from my desktop over here.

804
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:23,971
My note in the side there,

805
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:36,902
where the word says the city council may require any city officer, member of city agency, or a city employee to appear before it to give such information as the city council may require.

806
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:50,765
My first thought on that, I don't know if this covers being able to summon members from multi-member boards.

807
01:07:52,657 --> 01:08:01,780
And if it covers compelling the superintendent to come before them, and in both cases, I think it should.

808
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,301
To me, it does, but I don't.

809
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:09,642
It wasn't clear to me.

810
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:14,683
So I don't know if it needs to be spelled out more or if everybody's happy with it.

811
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:18,984
Well, we have city officer, member of a city agency or city employee.

812
01:08:19,124 --> 01:08:20,625
To me, that includes those people.

813
01:08:21,486 --> 01:08:37,392
So that members of, you know, like, you know, if the city council wanted to, you know, summon somebody from the historical commission or the liquor commission or, or whomever, or the bicycle commission that would cover that.

814
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:40,334
I think they're all city officers.

815
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,374
Cause they're pointing.

816
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:42,694
That's how I read it.

817
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:43,695
Okay.

818
01:08:44,795 --> 01:08:48,317
And then going back to notice.

819
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:54,544
I mean, the City Council may require to appear before there's not less than 10 days.

820
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:55,984
Okay, wait a minute.

821
01:08:56,624 --> 01:08:57,425
Are we still on 2-6?

822
01:08:57,465 --> 01:08:59,145
Yeah.

823
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:02,046
Okay.

824
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:02,986
The notice part.

825
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:11,069
The City Council shall give notice to any person of the City Council no less than 10 days.

826
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,551
My thought would be to be a bit more specific.

827
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:24,909
preparing a death at, well, let's see, no less than 10 days.

828
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,672
Um, so that would mean more than 10 days.

829
01:09:29,493 --> 01:09:47,287
Um, I would prefer, uh, either seven days or five days to account for, uh, if something came up at a Tuesday meeting, Tuesday committee of the whole meeting, um, they would want to be able to summons, you know,

830
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:51,427
the chief of staff or the mayor or whomever the following Tuesday.

831
01:09:53,148 --> 01:10:00,573
With the way it's written now, it appears that because they meet biweekly, they wouldn't.

832
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:04,575
Well, let's see.

833
01:10:05,095 --> 01:10:16,162
I think shortening the period of time, that way then that gets the individual being requested in front of the body sooner.

834
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,816
So that would be my preference.

835
01:10:20,336 --> 01:10:22,759
So you're proposing that we shorten the 10 days?

836
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,100
Yes.

837
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:26,182
And I have a question.

838
01:10:26,242 --> 01:10:28,925
Is that 10 business days or five business days?

839
01:10:30,607 --> 01:10:31,728
That's a good question.

840
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:38,875
And I think we've determined is that it'll be defined when we make our definitions.

841
01:10:40,777 --> 01:10:42,458
so that we don't have to say it every time.

842
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:46,519
I'm not sure which it would be, to be honest.

843
01:10:48,499 --> 01:11:10,025
I think we could write something in here, even getting more clear, is for the individual being requested to come before them, either the next meeting of that committee,

844
01:11:11,306 --> 01:11:15,229
I think that's too short a notice, Eunice, five days.

845
01:11:15,629 --> 01:11:17,250
What if the person's not in town?

846
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:22,133
And we have to have some reason of reasonability about this.

847
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:24,655
I get your point where you don't want it to go on.

848
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:25,535
I honestly do.

849
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,606
You know, what about saying the next regularly scheduled meeting of.

850
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:44,858
And if it's the insert the city council, or the next regular regularly scheduled committee of the whole, or the next regularly scheduled meeting of the.

851
01:11:44,879 --> 01:11:47,822
I don't know administration and finance committee.

852
01:11:48,902 --> 01:11:57,227
In my work, there are situations when we plan for people to come months ahead of a board meeting or a certain meeting.

853
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:01,269
So it may not be the exact next meeting when you need somebody.

854
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:03,550
I'm sorry, Aubrey, can you repeat that?

855
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:04,611
Oh, yeah, sorry.

856
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:10,233
In my current position, we ask people to come months ahead to a specific board meeting.

857
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:12,315
It may not be the next board meeting.

858
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:16,877
So I would not say a specific meeting time.

859
01:12:17,945 --> 01:12:18,545
Okay.

860
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:22,007
Ron, you have your hand up.

861
01:12:22,828 --> 01:12:34,935
I understand what Eunice is trying to do there, but, you know, there is, you know, I think 10 days is reasonable, but I also think that the question is really not if the City Council asked a specific person.

862
01:12:35,395 --> 01:12:38,997
I think it's the sense that, you know, I think the process is

863
01:12:39,557 --> 01:12:46,526
They ask a question of the mayor's office and they determine who the department head or the person who's responsible.

864
01:12:46,586 --> 01:12:53,694
I think we're missing some of the detail to, you know, describing who is actually the person.

865
01:12:53,754 --> 01:12:56,197
I mean, we may think it's traffic, but it could be parks.

866
01:12:56,558 --> 01:12:57,279
I mean, we just don't

867
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:09,368
I guess I don't understand why we're gonna name names of people as opposed to how it's done now, which is the mayor sends whoever she wants to represent that issue.

868
01:13:10,268 --> 01:13:11,669
Why don't they create different names?

869
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:16,391
Oh, you're saying because it says notice to any person.

870
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:17,531
Right.

871
01:13:19,152 --> 01:13:25,455
Well, I mean, it says earlier that it may require any city officer or member of a city agency or city employee.

872
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:26,375
So, I mean,

873
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:33,197
They can't just call anybody.

874
01:13:33,237 --> 01:13:35,759
It's someone who is one of those people.

875
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:39,341
That's how I read it.

876
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:51,309
This is definitely an improvement over the fact that there's nothing there now because the city council can request

877
01:13:54,801 --> 01:14:03,318
You know, whomever, you know, to come before them to discuss whatever and unless the it's usually department heads.

878
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:04,581
So, you know.

879
01:14:06,468 --> 01:14:19,534
the Department of Public Works or parking or whomever, unless the department head is directed by the mayor or chief of staff to show up, the city council, they don't have to answer to the city council.

880
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:30,958
So this is clearly a big improvement, but I just want to make sure that they're showing up in a timely manner.

881
01:14:32,716 --> 01:14:36,740
So do you want to put a time less than 10 days on the table?

882
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:46,549
Well, I hear what my colleagues on here are saying, where it may be difficult to schedule.

883
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,675
Is it worth knowing?

884
01:14:53,695 --> 01:14:56,357
Does the person need to be on the agenda?

885
01:14:56,437 --> 01:14:59,120
Is there an issue of time with getting something on an agenda?

886
01:15:00,623 --> 01:15:03,004
It would have to be on the agenda, I would imagine.

887
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,085
But this is just about giving notice.

888
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:08,927
This just says that they have to give the person at least 10 days notice.

889
01:15:09,528 --> 01:15:09,748
Yeah.

890
01:15:09,868 --> 01:15:17,512
I guess I'm wondering if the amount of time needs to coincide with like, yeah, I guess the agenda.

891
01:15:17,532 --> 01:15:18,472
I don't think they have to.

892
01:15:18,612 --> 01:15:23,174
The agenda has to be posted, I think, 48 hours in advance of the meeting.

893
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:28,817
Is there a difference between an emergency meeting and a regular meeting?

894
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:36,460
I think that there were provisions for emergencies in here.

895
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,003
So if it's an emergency meeting, you know, I don't think it's an emergency meeting.

896
01:15:42,023 --> 01:15:47,726
Okay, if it's not an emergency meeting, then the time frame is reasonable.

897
01:15:49,235 --> 01:15:52,156
All right, so Eunice, go back to you.

898
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:55,238
Do you want to make that proposal or do you want to be okay?

899
01:15:55,298 --> 01:15:56,859
Are you okay with leaving it at 10 days?

900
01:15:57,759 --> 01:16:01,081
Now, listening to my friends, I'm okay with leaving it.

901
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:02,581
I see the value in it.

902
01:16:03,422 --> 01:16:05,142
Okay, great.

903
01:16:06,023 --> 01:16:11,445
I just had two other things that I wanted to jump to, section 3.3.

904
01:16:13,226 --> 01:16:15,827
I don't have an answer for it, unfortunately, but I think it

905
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:20,138
deserves being tossed out there.

906
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:29,159
Maybe it requires more thought, or maybe it's mass general law, I don't know.

907
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:39,721
But we just had a whole debacle about the fire chief and civil service issues and things like that.

908
01:16:40,582 --> 01:16:41,962
And I didn't know if

909
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,249
something needed to be addressed in this section.

910
01:16:49,709 --> 01:17:01,332
And maybe this, maybe it requires some, I don't know, research from civil service, I guess, about what the mayor can and can't do, but.

911
01:17:01,472 --> 01:17:09,514
I don't, it says, for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided, well, by this charter.

912
01:17:09,574 --> 01:17:11,915
But I don't, there's got to be something that,

913
01:17:15,313 --> 01:17:21,314
I don't know, I can't see it in there.

914
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:25,855
I don't think that the charter can override something that's in law.

915
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:37,298
So tell me exactly what you think this should include.

916
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:46,828
that it doesn't?

917
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:56,212
That's fine.

918
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:11,179
The way it stands is no other method of selection is, I just don't understand how the mayor attempted, you know, the mayor tried to

919
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:17,551
appoint somebody without going through civil service a couple of months ago.

920
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:26,679
So just to clarify, that was that was an interim appointment that was not to point the fire chief.

921
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:29,301
There's a lot of confusion about that.

922
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:30,302
And, you know,

923
01:18:32,445 --> 01:18:37,347
I don't think it was a debacle in the sense that it was kind of transparent.

924
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:43,768
It was out, and it was discussed in the city council, and lawyers were involved.

925
01:18:44,368 --> 01:18:46,029
That's what happens in government.

926
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:47,869
Things like that occur.

927
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:58,524
Sometimes things have to change, sometimes they don't, but sometimes, you know, you see how the sausage is being made.

928
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:05,667
And so I don't think, I think the process worked the way it was supposed to.

929
01:19:06,648 --> 01:19:18,634
And, you know, it played out in public and people got to, you know, who was for it, who was against it, who was angry, and it got worked out legally.

930
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:20,735
So I think the process,

931
01:19:21,615 --> 01:19:29,462
Although it wasn't pretty, it served its purpose and it probably should stay that way.

932
01:19:30,883 --> 01:19:31,484
Okay, thanks.

933
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:32,105
Francis.

934
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:37,153
Just providing clarification, civil service is a set process.

935
01:19:37,994 --> 01:19:46,340
If there is a situation where an interim needs to be made, that does not follow the set civil service process.

936
01:19:46,961 --> 01:19:54,046
So that is where there was confusion, because we all know that certain positions are civil service positions.

937
01:19:54,566 --> 01:19:59,910
We're used to seeing the civil service process being utilized when there are vacancies.

938
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:06,396
But this is one of those situations where I would say felt under like an emergency category.

939
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:09,878
I don't know how they phrase that in civil service.

940
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:14,342
So there are other things that are done as a result.

941
01:20:16,874 --> 01:20:22,638
Yeah, and I don't think this charter would take any positions out of civil service that are in civil service.

942
01:20:23,299 --> 01:20:24,480
No, definitely shouldn't.

943
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:27,502
Okay.

944
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:28,322
Anything else?

945
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:29,663
And just one more.

946
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:34,887
I seem to have lost it on my screen here, but I think if you scroll down, keep going.

947
01:20:35,908 --> 01:20:37,789
In the mayor section?

948
01:20:38,289 --> 01:20:39,270
Temporary appointments.

949
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:41,612
I think it was back up there.

950
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:48,846
There's been some occasions over the past couple of years.

951
01:20:49,907 --> 01:20:54,752
Where we've lost some department heads in the city and.

952
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:59,896
There's been hiring of an interim department head.

953
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:00,797
That has.

954
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:10,003
You know, served the position is serving the position here in Medford and serving the same position in another municipality.

955
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:15,406
And I know it's caused some angst from the city council.

956
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:20,388
And so my question is, and thought is.

957
01:21:21,588 --> 01:21:29,354
Should vacancies, especially for department heads, be filled with interims serving the same role in another municipality?

958
01:21:30,996 --> 01:21:35,399
And my thought is that that might be serving conflict of interest.

959
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:47,729
And so, you know, perhaps... So you're proposing that somewhere we put in... Think about where you want to put that.

960
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:50,892
And while you're doing that, Frances is raising her hand.

961
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:57,156
So there are conflict of interest laws that guide that.

962
01:21:57,897 --> 01:22:04,500
And you would have to contact David, I can't remember his last name at the State Ethics Commission.

963
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:20,947
But my understanding and recollection is that as long as the information is declared, you can work for two separate municipalities in similar roles, but the information has to be declared.

964
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:23,268
Does that make sense?

965
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:25,992
Yeah, sure, it absolutely does.

966
01:22:26,072 --> 01:22:26,572
Thank you.

967
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:32,854
I guess then the question leads to, just because you can, does it mean you should?

968
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:44,536
So then do you want to propose that we put that that can't be, I mean, this person would only be serving for no more than 180 days.

969
01:22:45,276 --> 01:22:49,137
So that's a half a year.

970
01:22:50,237 --> 01:22:51,497
Yeah.

971
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,720
Can I say something?

972
01:22:58,261 --> 01:22:58,921
Yeah.

973
01:22:58,961 --> 01:22:59,521
I'm interested.

974
01:22:59,661 --> 01:23:01,001
I'm sorry, Jean had her hand up.

975
01:23:01,162 --> 01:23:02,102
Jean had her hand up.

976
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:02,862
Sorry, Jean.

977
01:23:03,002 --> 01:23:04,423
Jean, go ahead.

978
01:23:05,703 --> 01:23:12,986
I would have concerns about limiting, making restrictions just because it's hard to hire sometimes.

979
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:15,967
And this is a temporary position.

980
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:22,309
Are we making it harder for the city to function if we make that kind of restriction?

981
01:23:22,329 --> 01:23:26,070
Because I could see if it was a permanent, but then I think

982
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,861
conflict of interest rules, or even just how can you work full-time at two places.

983
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:37,003
But for temporary, I could see it might make sense if we can't.

984
01:23:37,483 --> 01:23:38,824
I know we have trouble hiring.

985
01:23:40,564 --> 01:23:40,784
True.

986
01:23:40,904 --> 01:23:40,964
OK.

987
01:23:41,024 --> 01:23:42,105
Anthony?

988
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:47,283
Yeah, I kind of agree with Gene.

989
01:23:47,683 --> 01:23:56,187
Just like in the adventure stage, someone from the highway department, the guy that was in charge of plowing the roads, left.

990
01:23:56,607 --> 01:23:59,128
And we were facing a blizzard.

991
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:05,951
And the only person that could help out was the highway guy from Malden.

992
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:25,892
That's where, you know, something like this would come into play, where, you know, people have a certain expertise that we don't have available to us in Medford, or we probably wouldn't reach out to someone in another community unless it was kind of, we were in a pinch.

993
01:24:26,432 --> 01:24:34,799
So I wouldn't want to tie anybody's hand, say, no, no, we can't, you know, ask that guy because, you know, the charter says,

994
01:24:35,912 --> 01:24:38,673
says we can't even though we need them desperately.

995
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:42,493
So that's my take on it.

996
01:24:42,673 --> 01:24:43,454
Thanks, Anthony.

997
01:24:43,794 --> 01:24:46,334
Phyllis, I'm sorry if I. Oh, no, that's OK.

998
01:24:46,474 --> 01:24:47,614
I'm just looking at the yellow.

999
01:24:47,774 --> 01:24:48,895
I'm looking at the yellow hands.

1000
01:24:49,075 --> 01:24:49,715
So go ahead.

1001
01:24:49,735 --> 01:24:50,755
Yeah, I was supposed to put my hands.

1002
01:24:51,055 --> 01:24:56,376
No, I completely agree with Gene and with Anthony.

1003
01:24:56,696 --> 01:25:01,297
We might harm ourselves more than anything else if we leave some of these positions empty.

1004
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:04,178
I think Anthony brings up a great point, if we have a blizzard.

1005
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:18,551
And I get Eunice's point, but because this is temporary, you know, I don't think I think we have to stay open to the option that we at least have someone in that position, even temporarily, rather than leaving it empty.

1006
01:25:19,972 --> 01:25:23,996
Okay, so, Eunice, do you want to bring it up to a vote?

1007
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:28,239
No, I think I appreciate hearing from the others.

1008
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,102
And I can see the point now.

1009
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:31,302
So

1010
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:32,111
Thank you.

1011
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:32,391
Okay.

1012
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:33,252
Great.

1013
01:25:33,932 --> 01:25:34,232
All right.

1014
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:36,893
Do we have any other proposals on this text?

1015
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:41,754
Can we vote to accept it?

1016
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:51,538
Obviously, the Collins Center is going to look at it and give us clarification on highlighted parts and flag anything maybe that we should re-look at.

1017
01:25:52,358 --> 01:25:57,420
But can we vote to say this is ready to send in draft form to the Collins Center?

1018
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:01,552
and make motion to send it in draft form to the policy.

1019
01:26:02,512 --> 01:26:03,092
I second.

1020
01:26:03,773 --> 01:26:04,253
Okay.

1021
01:26:07,374 --> 01:26:08,415
Okay, let's vote.

1022
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:09,035
Anthony?

1023
01:26:10,016 --> 01:26:11,576
Yes.

1024
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:12,497
Phyllis?

1025
01:26:13,397 --> 01:26:13,698
Yes.

1026
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:17,519
Jean?

1027
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:18,740
Yes.

1028
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:19,660
Aubrey?

1029
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:20,481
Yes.

1030
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:22,062
Ron?

1031
01:26:22,882 --> 01:26:23,222
Yes.

1032
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:24,503
Eunice?

1033
01:26:24,863 --> 01:26:25,043
Yes.

1034
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:29,689
Who haven't I gotten?

1035
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:30,370
Paulette?

1036
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,151
Yes.

1037
01:26:31,652 --> 01:26:32,252
Danielle?

1038
01:26:32,793 --> 01:26:33,033
Yes.

1039
01:26:34,335 --> 01:26:36,617
And I'm yes.

1040
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:38,439
Is that everybody?

1041
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:39,621
Are we 10 now?

1042
01:26:39,641 --> 01:26:41,222
I thought we were nine.

1043
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:44,499
Yep.

1044
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:44,919
Yes.

1045
01:26:45,459 --> 01:26:45,699
Yes.

1046
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:46,440
Okay.

1047
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,940
So that's awesome.

1048
01:26:48,121 --> 01:26:49,061
Congratulations.

1049
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:49,981
Yay.

1050
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:50,862
All right.

1051
01:26:51,522 --> 01:26:57,405
Now, I want to move on and hand it over to the school committee subcommittee.

1052
01:26:57,425 --> 01:26:59,606
Great.

1053
01:27:00,827 --> 01:27:02,208
So Aubrey's going to bring it up.

1054
01:27:03,408 --> 01:27:05,029
No, can you make me co-host, please?

1055
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:06,190
Yes, I will.

1056
01:27:13,272 --> 01:27:14,933
So tell me if that allows you to share.

1057
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:17,055
Yes.

1058
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,882
So many of the subcommittee members are here, of course.

1059
01:27:28,203 --> 01:27:34,447
For those of you who didn't sit in our deliberations, we went through a whole lot of different options.

1060
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:36,489
And there was a lot of compromise.

1061
01:27:40,262 --> 01:27:45,006
you know, hopefully there were some paragraphs now that will need to be aligned with other stuff that we do.

1062
01:27:45,906 --> 01:27:54,733
But to start out, fundamentally, most importantly, we said that the school committee shall consist of seven members who will be elected as follows.

1063
01:27:56,034 --> 01:28:02,619
For the purpose of the school committee election, four combined wards will be created from the eight wards of the city.

1064
01:28:03,239 --> 01:28:07,843
From each combined ward, one candidate will be elected by the voters of that combined ward.

1065
01:28:08,523 --> 01:28:14,204
In addition, two candidates will be selected at large by the voters of all four combined wards.

1066
01:28:14,845 --> 01:28:21,566
And I did attach at the end of this document a addendum.

1067
01:28:21,986 --> 01:28:27,068
Ron had written the elections committee to find out if we could, in fact, combine wards.

1068
01:28:27,148 --> 01:28:32,109
And for the purposes of creating school committee voting districts, we can do that.

1069
01:28:33,129 --> 01:28:35,530
There is a long reason for

1070
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:43,633
why we did that rather than having just ward, voting by wards.

1071
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:57,078
We're very concerned about the fact that the school committee is a little bit different than the city council, and that, you know, there's not always people who are interested in running for school committee, and they certainly might not be evenly

1072
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:58,899
proportioned across the city.

1073
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:05,645
But at the same time, we were very cognizant of understanding that there seemed to be a move.

1074
01:29:05,665 --> 01:29:15,633
There were both in Lowell and then recently in Worcester, court cases, which basically said, you need to have ward representation.

1075
01:29:15,813 --> 01:29:22,918
So this was the way that those two communities, again, much larger than us, those two cities have worked it out.

1076
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:25,640
And we felt it was the best

1077
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:27,661
possible way.

1078
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:30,022
Aubrey, could you go back to the top, please?

1079
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:33,782
I just want to make one comment about that.

1080
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:38,483
I don't know if you saw the feedback from the call center that came in today.

1081
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:41,864
I did see it, but I haven't been able to really.

1082
01:29:42,884 --> 01:29:49,065
We'll have to say in the charter how the wards, which wards are combined.

1083
01:29:49,646 --> 01:29:51,566
Can't just say four combined wards.

1084
01:29:52,672 --> 01:29:52,872
Right.

1085
01:29:52,952 --> 01:29:57,614
I don't think for the presentation tonight, that was our... Right.

1086
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:06,198
But I'm just saying we will have to decide on that or figure that out as part of it if the committee just agrees to go ahead and do it.

1087
01:30:06,678 --> 01:30:07,338
Right.

1088
01:30:07,438 --> 01:30:13,481
I think the Secretary of State's office is the one who finalizes those things, too.

1089
01:30:13,961 --> 01:30:15,542
I don't think so in this case.

1090
01:30:16,382 --> 01:30:17,703
To validate the numbers?

1091
01:30:18,763 --> 01:30:19,784
Well, maybe... I thought they would.

1092
01:30:22,161 --> 01:30:26,163
I don't know that they would, I don't know that they would validate the numbers.

1093
01:30:26,524 --> 01:30:26,984
I don't know.

1094
01:30:27,164 --> 01:30:46,218
I know that in Lowell and in Worcester, they hired a consultant to combine the wards, but they also had the concern of the lawsuits alleging that they were violating the Voting Rights Act, that they were considered as well as population.

1095
01:30:47,749 --> 01:30:56,052
Do you think the Collins Center wants us to put that in our presentation about the charter, so we have to work on that?

1096
01:30:56,632 --> 01:31:04,475
They're saying if the whole committee says, yeah, we want to do this, we will have to decide how the wards are going to be broken up.

1097
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:05,535
Got it.

1098
01:31:06,015 --> 01:31:06,595
Or combined.

1099
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:12,237
So to the whole committee, it would be easier to just say one from every ward.

1100
01:31:12,658 --> 01:31:13,718
There's no doubt about that.

1101
01:31:14,363 --> 01:31:16,264
or all members are at large.

1102
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:23,265
And there are arguments pro and con, which we argued lengthily, at great length.

1103
01:31:24,586 --> 01:31:32,388
And again, where these combined words are something that is now being done for the purposes of school committee.

1104
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:44,809
We also, after great debate, did concur that the mayor would continue to be service chair, as outlined in 4-2.

1105
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:53,898
The term of office, again, after great debate, we kept it to two years, which is going to not necessarily make anybody happy.

1106
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:56,300
There was a uniform

1107
01:31:57,641 --> 01:32:03,103
opinion across the board that everybody we talked to said, gee, if only we could do three years.

1108
01:32:03,523 --> 01:32:05,704
I mean, there was a lot of support for three years.

1109
01:32:06,465 --> 01:32:10,866
And at this point, we don't really know how to do that.

1110
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:14,748
I think that that needs to be a separate discovery.

1111
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:24,832
You know, one of the very difficult things about this is sort of saying we haven't heard anybody feeling like, let's change our voters to spring.

1112
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:32,194
like all the towns, because in towns, it's much easier to achieve the goal of a three-year term.

1113
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:34,794
But we don't feel like there's the will.

1114
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:40,096
Without that, it feels like real experiment to do it.

1115
01:32:40,296 --> 01:32:42,496
So we stuck with the two years.

1116
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:47,237
And there's many reasons why the two years is not good, but that's what we stuck with.

1117
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:53,079
We did feel overall, we heard that four years felt just too long.

1118
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:55,780
So we heard a lot of that.

1119
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,481
So anyway, that's where it's at.

1120
01:32:59,661 --> 01:33:00,441
Eligibility.

1121
01:33:06,724 --> 01:33:13,326
If I think a school committee member shall at the time of election be a Medford voter or resident, I don't know.

1122
01:33:13,386 --> 01:33:17,847
If a school committee member moves from Medford during the term, I think this is pretty standard.

1123
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:21,429
The office shall immediately be deemed vacant.

1124
01:33:22,284 --> 01:33:37,663
For ward eligibility, we do have a school committee candidate shall be at the time of election to be a Medford voter and shall have resided in the ward they wish to represent for one year prior to submitting nomination papers for the office of school committee.

1125
01:33:38,003 --> 01:33:40,726
And again, it doesn't have to be that date.

1126
01:33:41,555 --> 01:33:51,025
But trying to make a distinction is if someone wants to represent a certain ward, shouldn't they have lived in that ward for some period of time?

1127
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:52,526
Now, there was a debate about that.

1128
01:33:53,067 --> 01:33:58,272
And we may ultimately come back to that to be in line with the city council people.

1129
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:00,274
But that's how we've written it at this time.

1130
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:04,178
Do we have questions or should I just keep on moving?

1131
01:34:06,628 --> 01:34:07,389
Is that a hand?

1132
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:15,655
Maybe it's a question, but the saying Medford voter versus Medford resident is that is it required that your voter to run for resident is fine.

1133
01:34:16,936 --> 01:34:17,577
Yeah, we can check.

1134
01:34:17,597 --> 01:34:19,518
We can change the vote resident.

1135
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:21,620
It's.

1136
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:27,184
I've done it a couple times, so just feel free to to end up in the top.

1137
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:28,025
Aubrey, thank you.

1138
01:34:28,045 --> 01:34:31,968
Gene, can I just interrupt?

1139
01:34:32,148 --> 01:34:32,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

1140
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:33,009
Go ahead.

1141
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:39,038
Can you say more about your decision to leave the mayor as chair?

1142
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:43,226
So that was a very complex discussion.

1143
01:34:43,866 --> 01:34:47,889
Ultimately, we had talked to all three mayors.

1144
01:34:48,589 --> 01:35:05,280
All three mayors thought it was a very key part of their job as the mayor, that the largest proportion of the budget is the school committee, and that it gave them a real understanding of all the school committee issues.

1145
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,461
It also was, as we talked about it,

1146
01:35:09,362 --> 01:35:16,724
if you're going for the voting by ward, you've got, it's the mayor who's voted by all of the population.

1147
01:35:18,325 --> 01:35:28,428
And, you know, again, I felt strongly as someone who had been on the school committee that it was very, very valuable to have the mayor.

1148
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:35,510
So with other people, ultimately, you know, this went back and forth and back and forth.

1149
01:35:37,602 --> 01:35:44,345
you know, with some people disagreeing and, um, you know, this is where we landed.

1150
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:45,546
Okay.

1151
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:51,728
And I add something that I learned during the process was that the mayor's vote counts the same as everybody else's vote.

1152
01:35:52,189 --> 01:36:04,374
And also as chair, their job is to, um, put together the agenda and maybe be less involved in some of the conversations that have that happened during the meeting.

1153
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:06,115
Okay.

1154
01:36:08,227 --> 01:36:14,091
And what did this, because you interviewed the school committee members, what did they, did they weigh in on that?

1155
01:36:14,392 --> 01:36:15,572
Oh, it was very split.

1156
01:36:16,293 --> 01:36:22,578
There were some committee members who really didn't want the mayor as chair, and there were some who really did want the mayor's chair.

1157
01:36:22,618 --> 01:36:23,338
It's very split.

1158
01:36:23,658 --> 01:36:29,703
And with all of this, I mean, that's one of the things that I found is whoever you talk to, it was the next opinion.

1159
01:36:29,723 --> 01:36:31,544
And if there was,

1160
01:36:33,085 --> 01:36:37,208
if there was more of uniformity of our agreement, but there wasn't.

1161
01:36:38,869 --> 01:36:40,209
And we're doing the best we can.

1162
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:53,798
And in the, you know, it's very interesting to get the mayor's feedback and where they had come from and sort of saying is that they were the ones who were elected by everybody.

1163
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:57,500
And we are going to award, you know, representation.

1164
01:37:00,203 --> 01:37:29,438
So I don't know if any of the members of the committee want to speak to it, but I think what swayed me, I was in the, I don't think the mayor should be chair camp, but I think after hearing from, you know, through Paulette, hearing from Mayor McGlynn, Mayor Burke, and Mayor Longo Kern,

1165
01:37:30,164 --> 01:37:48,515
as to the value that all three of them put on their role, where they said that they were in front of the community, required to be in front of the community every other Monday, that was sacred to them.

1166
01:37:49,876 --> 01:37:58,421
And that, as she said, the school committee is the largest portion of the budget and that,

1167
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,002
The mayor.

1168
01:38:01,203 --> 01:38:02,924
doesn't speak as much.

1169
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:10,567
And if he or she does speak, they always speak last after they've heard from all of their colleagues.

1170
01:38:11,188 --> 01:38:16,590
So they have a good sense of the issues and concerns and so forth.

1171
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:30,757
So that's what swayed me, the value that the three mayors that we've had, you know, in throughout most of my life, the value that they put on it that put me in the, you know, it's a good idea camp.

1172
01:38:31,525 --> 01:38:38,090
And what was so interesting about that was, however different they were, there was a consensus.

1173
01:38:39,071 --> 01:38:40,792
And we weren't talking at the same time.

1174
01:38:40,812 --> 01:38:43,694
I was talking to them individually.

1175
01:38:44,735 --> 01:38:48,818
So that, I think, was one of the reasons.

1176
01:38:50,762 --> 01:38:54,283
You know, a lot of people had talked about about power.

1177
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:55,643
We're giving them too much power.

1178
01:38:55,683 --> 01:39:07,267
And then sort of saying is, boy, you want that mayor to know your school issues and understand your school issues and what it means to those kids, to each and every one.

1179
01:39:07,367 --> 01:39:10,067
And there is no better way than being present at the meetings.

1180
01:39:11,928 --> 01:39:14,729
So anyway, that's that's where we we landed.

1181
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:23,613
And I should say throughout this, the one thing about our subcommittee is there was a lot of movement.

1182
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:33,319
And sometimes I feel, just my little editorial, you know, there's not a lot now of coming together.

1183
01:39:33,379 --> 01:39:38,402
And in this subcommittee, we really worked to try and figure those things out.

1184
01:39:40,383 --> 01:39:41,343
Ron and then Danielle?

1185
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:47,287
Ron?

1186
01:39:48,137 --> 01:39:49,679
Ron, you're muted.

1187
01:39:51,562 --> 01:39:52,484
My 1st comment is to.

1188
01:39:52,524 --> 01:39:58,192
No, but do you think we should be going through this section by section gaining agreement and then.

1189
01:39:58,693 --> 01:40:02,319
Make it easier to do the whole document, or do you want to just fly through it?

1190
01:40:02,835 --> 01:40:04,556
That's a good question.

1191
01:40:05,397 --> 01:40:09,340
I thought you guys would give a presentation and then people would sort of study it.

1192
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,443
And then at the next meeting, we would vote on things.

1193
01:40:12,823 --> 01:40:13,423
Yeah, that's fine.

1194
01:40:13,443 --> 01:40:14,304
I just didn't know.

1195
01:40:14,764 --> 01:40:16,526
I don't want to just go back and forth.

1196
01:40:16,626 --> 01:40:17,407
And that's fine.

1197
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:17,887
I get it.

1198
01:40:19,724 --> 01:40:21,085
Yeah.

1199
01:40:21,565 --> 01:40:22,686
Is that what you thought, Paula?

1200
01:40:23,066 --> 01:40:23,286
Yes.

1201
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:26,428
I thought that I was just sort of giving an overview of the most important parts.

1202
01:40:28,089 --> 01:40:29,910
That's fine.

1203
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:30,411
That's fine.

1204
01:40:30,471 --> 01:40:30,551
Okay.

1205
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:45,340
To the other question, I just want to say that, yes, Paula's right in terms of we came in with preconceived notions, of course, but the public participation was huge in a lot of this decision-making process.

1206
01:40:46,282 --> 01:40:48,864
The three interviews with the mayors was important.

1207
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:53,227
We did interview the mayor of Malden, who did not think he had to be the chair of the committee.

1208
01:40:54,128 --> 01:41:00,193
And I deferred a lot, to be honest with you, to Paulette, who lived the life that we're trying to make easier.

1209
01:41:00,273 --> 01:41:05,257
So she was very strong in her opinion, and I support her 100%.

1210
01:41:05,297 --> 01:41:05,637
Danielle?

1211
01:41:05,657 --> 01:41:15,645
Yeah, I'm just going to ask on the question about the mayor being the chair, what our survey said of the

1212
01:41:16,398 --> 01:41:18,840
public, or like where that figured in?

1213
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:27,446
I think that it was pretty mixed.

1214
01:41:27,566 --> 01:41:41,716
One of the difficulties that I have with that is that you ask people, like, I mean, I remember when we were at the wonderful Rights Pond event, and you were kind of asking people some of these questions, and they were thinking about these things off the top of their head.

1215
01:41:44,103 --> 01:41:55,649
While it was very useful to get as much feedback as possible, you know, there's, dare I say, many people who've never watched a school committee meeting.

1216
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,751
So, you know, it's sort of like, ugh.

1217
01:42:01,523 --> 01:42:11,589
I don't know, I found it difficult to tell because obviously we wanted to take into account the public's opinions as much as possible.

1218
01:42:11,949 --> 01:42:16,471
And I think in terms of moving towards the wards, we did.

1219
01:42:18,753 --> 01:42:29,118
That was a big, I mean, because certainly for me, I had started out being completely at large and I certainly moved on that along the way.

1220
01:42:30,059 --> 01:42:30,379
Anthony?

1221
01:42:33,282 --> 01:42:37,203
I thank you all for the work you did on this committee.

1222
01:42:37,504 --> 01:42:41,325
I think you had a very challenging task.

1223
01:42:42,045 --> 01:42:44,345
I just want a couple of things.

1224
01:42:44,425 --> 01:42:53,568
As a parent who had children in Method Public Schools, I understand the importance of having a strong school committee.

1225
01:42:53,988 --> 01:43:00,550
And I think the presence of the mayor being on the school committee, for me, historically, when I

1226
01:43:01,572 --> 01:43:12,781
had some issues or challenging questions, I was on the phone with the mayor.

1227
01:43:13,722 --> 01:43:30,496
I feel that it's important for residents who have an issue with the schools to be able to reach their mayor and have their mayor intervene for them if something is

1228
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,071
needs to be addressed.

1229
01:43:33,972 --> 01:43:56,631
And just one other thing about the mayor being on the school committee, given what we're facing with the opportunity of building a new high school for the future kids in Medford, the mayor's being part of the school committee and working together with the school committee is gonna be key to making that a reality.

1230
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,273
And that's a task that

1231
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:16,156
And I remember hearing somewhere that, you know, part of the reason that we got our elementary schools and were able to be so successful was that, you know, Mayor McGlynn was, you know, part of the school committee and really kind of was able to

1232
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:20,897
put all the pieces together and get everybody on board.

1233
01:44:20,977 --> 01:44:35,446
And I think it's going to be important for the mayor to have that opportunity to kind of work with the school committee folks to have that vision become a reality because I think

1234
01:44:35,786 --> 01:44:38,148
you know, the kids need it, you know.

1235
01:44:38,408 --> 01:44:44,492
And it's not so much the politics of school committee, it's, you know, the results.

1236
01:44:44,992 --> 01:44:45,993
We need some results.

1237
01:44:46,133 --> 01:44:50,056
And I think it's important to hold the mayor accountable.

1238
01:44:50,316 --> 01:44:55,779
And that's a good way, like, to judge a mayor on, you know, should you vote to re-elect your mayors?

1239
01:44:55,879 --> 01:44:58,261
You know, how did they perform on the school committee?

1240
01:44:58,481 --> 01:45:00,182
You know, what did they do for the kids?

1241
01:45:00,823 --> 01:45:03,004
And I think...

1242
01:45:04,702 --> 01:45:05,923
Go ahead.

1243
01:45:05,943 --> 01:45:06,443
I'm sorry.

1244
01:45:06,483 --> 01:45:07,343
I ramble with them out.

1245
01:45:07,503 --> 01:45:08,564
No, no, I hear what you're saying.

1246
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:14,906
I just want to be clear that at no time I don't think in this subcommittee do we think the mayor should not be on the school committee.

1247
01:45:14,926 --> 01:45:16,727
It was more about the chairperson.

1248
01:45:17,267 --> 01:45:20,468
It was more about, you know, that role.

1249
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:31,933
But to answer Danielle's question, there were a lot of survey results that were against the mayor being the chairperson and a lot of interviews and feedback that we got

1250
01:45:33,233 --> 01:45:43,456
that were very, very powerful feedback that they thought that the job is better served by a different school committee.

1251
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:48,378
So there were definitely, it wasn't like a landslide victory that we said the mayor should be chairman.

1252
01:45:48,418 --> 01:45:49,418
I just want to make that point.

1253
01:45:52,435 --> 01:45:57,899
OK, so I'm going to go on, I think, just so we can get through this because we're time is fleeting.

1254
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:10,168
By the way, one question is we've traditionally in Medford always called the secretary secretary while clerk was shown in different documents.

1255
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:18,194
And so the question ultimately was, do we go with what's traditional in Medford secretary or is there a preference for clerk?

1256
01:46:19,635 --> 01:46:22,137
I don't, you know,

1257
01:46:22,908 --> 01:46:23,268
I don't know.

1258
01:46:24,609 --> 01:46:35,037
Um, for the school committee organization, we had the mayor shall service chair of the school committee, and then the language about, you know, when they should take their positions.

1259
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:45,360
And then the school committee members shall choose from amongst themselves a vice chair and a secretary who will each serve for one year.

1260
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:54,751
The person, the position should rotate amongst members with no members serving more than one consecutive year in the role for which they have been selected for by their peers.

1261
01:46:55,832 --> 01:47:03,395
And that is something which I did speak to very specifically as from my time.

1262
01:47:03,495 --> 01:47:09,137
I think that the idea is not to then create a mini person in charge.

1263
01:47:09,197 --> 01:47:17,981
I think that you learn as you're a school committee member how to do that role, and it's important for it to rotate amongst members.

1264
01:47:18,801 --> 01:47:19,641
So we put that in.

1265
01:47:23,152 --> 01:47:24,812
The chair shall prepare the agenda.

1266
01:47:24,832 --> 01:47:28,733
There was a lot of concern that this gave the mayor too much work.

1267
01:47:28,773 --> 01:47:43,096
But but what and we we interviewed both Dr. The president, Superintendent Maurice Edouard Vincent and former Superintendent Roy Belson.

1268
01:47:43,696 --> 01:47:52,858
And, you know, the superintendent's office and the superintendent puts the agenda together and runs it by the mayor.

1269
01:47:54,099 --> 01:48:01,765
there is a process within the school committee, within their own rules, of making sure that they can put something on the agenda.

1270
01:48:03,146 --> 01:48:14,535
That the chair presides at all regular meetings, it regulates its proceedings, decides on all questions of order, and it doesn't say, by the way, that we run our

1271
01:48:16,076 --> 01:48:18,778
meetings by Robert's rules of order.

1272
01:48:18,818 --> 01:48:26,542
And I wondered for both the city council, whether at some point we ought to be making that clear, but that's how meetings are run.

1273
01:48:28,283 --> 01:48:34,005
The chair shall appoint all members of the school committee to the various subcommittees.

1274
01:48:34,746 --> 01:48:42,510
I did add the clause after seeking their individual input regarding interest in availability, because I always thought it was important that we got asked

1275
01:48:43,771 --> 01:48:49,235
The chair will have the same powers to vote upon measures coming before the school committee as any other member.

1276
01:48:50,296 --> 01:48:58,402
The vice chair presides in the absence of the chair, and the secretary both records the votes taken at a regular school committee meeting.

1277
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:06,288
I should say there's also professional backup, but the secretary is the one who calls the rolls.

1278
01:49:07,389 --> 01:49:11,292
And in Medford, the secretary is responsible for overseeing and

1279
01:49:11,732 --> 01:49:13,574
approving the bills of the school department.

1280
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:22,444
At some point, the school committee could form a subcommittee expressly for reviewing the bills.

1281
01:49:22,924 --> 01:49:24,606
That is not how we do it right now.

1282
01:49:26,408 --> 01:49:28,090
It has been discussed over time.

1283
01:49:28,551 --> 01:49:32,815
So at this right now, the secretary is the designated person.

1284
01:49:34,716 --> 01:49:38,058
And it's a very important role.

1285
01:49:39,278 --> 01:49:47,341
At school committee meetings, when the bills are presented, school committee members ask questions.

1286
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:54,143
And very often when I was a secretary or someone else was the secretary, they would say, what about this expenditure?

1287
01:49:54,743 --> 01:49:56,844
And you would have actually seen the bill

1288
01:49:57,724 --> 01:50:02,207
And you would have, as the secretary, have a chance to ask questions about it.

1289
01:50:03,247 --> 01:50:11,552
By the way, the sign-off also is the finance person and the superintendent of schools also review the bills.

1290
01:50:12,492 --> 01:50:13,913
So that's how we do it now.

1291
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,034
Limitations.

1292
01:50:17,795 --> 01:50:20,857
No member shall hold any other city office.

1293
01:50:21,077 --> 01:50:25,740
No former member of the school committee shall hold any compensated appointed city office.

1294
01:50:26,893 --> 01:50:30,135
until at least one year after the date of the member service on the school committee.

1295
01:50:30,175 --> 01:50:31,576
This is pretty standard language.

1296
01:50:32,697 --> 01:50:46,566
There was in the different ones, charters that we looked at this whole thing about, however, if someone has vacated a position in order to serve as a member of the school committee, they may return to the same office.

1297
01:50:48,087 --> 01:50:51,851
of city employment held at the time the position was vacated.

1298
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:57,518
And Ron, you will remember we discussed this and I put in the clause, if it has remained vacant.

1299
01:50:59,162 --> 01:51:00,562
because we were worried about that.

1300
01:51:00,902 --> 01:51:02,103
That is not something we wrote.

1301
01:51:02,423 --> 01:51:05,523
We can go to the Collins and say, why is it in all these other charters?

1302
01:51:05,863 --> 01:51:08,284
But it was consistently in other charters.

1303
01:51:08,644 --> 01:51:13,225
And I don't know whether that's just because someone put it in and then someone else copied it and someone else copied it.

1304
01:51:13,325 --> 01:51:17,266
So, but that's how we wrote it here.

1305
01:51:18,866 --> 01:51:28,168
Compensation, we just said that, you know, I wanted to make sure we didn't work out terminology on this because it should be consistent with everyone else.

1306
01:51:29,371 --> 01:51:31,492
Section 4-5, powers and duties.

1307
01:51:32,252 --> 01:51:39,555
The first part of this was taken from the school committee powers and duties, which is outlined on their website.

1308
01:51:40,256 --> 01:51:45,518
This is standard put together by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1309
01:51:46,318 --> 01:51:49,439
The Collins Center did say it was more detailed than other charters.

1310
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:58,243
I don't know how I feel about that because I'm not sure that we should be trying to make it less detailed, but I'll go back and review those comments.

1311
01:51:59,903 --> 01:52:11,026
I did want to make sure that we put the sentence in because I think it's a good reminder to any elected official that by yourself, you're nothing, except if you're the mayor.

1312
01:52:11,326 --> 01:52:16,407
But a voting majority of the school committee shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties.

1313
01:52:16,967 --> 01:52:21,688
And no individual member is empowered to act unless by vote of the school committee.

1314
01:52:22,408 --> 01:52:28,430
And to me, that's an extremely important reminder to those elected to the school committee that you are

1315
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:35,453
part of city government and by yourself, you do not have a power.

1316
01:52:35,513 --> 01:52:43,757
You're not, as a school committee, you're not supposed to go to a department head and ask questions and boss them around, whatever.

1317
01:52:43,857 --> 01:52:44,817
So anyway.

1318
01:52:47,617 --> 01:52:52,819
Of the powers and duties, selection, evaluation, and removal of a superintendent is key.

1319
01:52:53,539 --> 01:52:55,499
Making policy is key.

1320
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:01,421
And putting together the operating budget for the school system is key.

1321
01:53:01,561 --> 01:53:10,364
So those are really outlined in the first A, B, and C. And I'm going to leave the fine print for people to read.

1322
01:53:11,344 --> 01:53:12,525
Filling of vacancies.

1323
01:53:15,911 --> 01:53:25,174
try to be as consistent as what I've heard other language to be in descending, if it's an at large, it's in descending order of votes received by the candidate.

1324
01:53:27,454 --> 01:53:32,636
And if the person is eligible and willing to serve, and the city clerk shall certify this.

1325
01:53:33,756 --> 01:53:36,177
If it's, oh, sorry, that was the award was in one.

1326
01:53:37,942 --> 01:53:40,503
And then two is at large.

1327
01:53:41,183 --> 01:53:56,686
And then three says, in the event that there is no ward candidate available to fill the vacated seat, a school committee member serving as an at-large member and who resides in the vacated ward may choose to fill the ward position provided they reside in the ward.

1328
01:53:57,026 --> 01:54:00,587
Now, that is something we didn't discuss, guys, who were on this.

1329
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:05,849
My thinking about, we were trying to think about it, and I said, look, I have to play with the language,

1330
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,070
An at-large campaign is harder.

1331
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:18,171
Maybe somebody would rather be a ward representative, but there's been somebody in that seat, so they ran as at-large.

1332
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:28,594
If it became vacant, maybe they would want to shift over, and that would give a larger pool of candidates available potentially as at-large.

1333
01:54:28,654 --> 01:54:30,955
So again, you can agree or disagree.

1334
01:54:31,035 --> 01:54:36,016
I was just trying to figure out language that made sense.

1335
01:54:36,856 --> 01:54:39,863
that was logically sound from what we were saying.

1336
01:54:42,489 --> 01:54:44,653
Filling of vacancies by school committee.

1337
01:54:48,004 --> 01:54:49,344
I don't think there's anything different.

1338
01:54:49,744 --> 01:55:03,767
Oh, the only thing is I had mentioned earlier, a person serving as a school committee member under this section shall not be entitled to have the words candidate for reelection printed against the person's name ballot, unless the vacancy occurred in the first year of the two year term.

1339
01:55:05,168 --> 01:55:06,948
I don't even know if that's legal.

1340
01:55:07,688 --> 01:55:14,850
Again, it went back to my kind of sort of saying, wait a second, this person is gonna do all the work and be appointed and then,

1341
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:22,902
To me, it felt kind of sort of kicked in the teeth that they were going to be not considered for re-election.

1342
01:55:23,202 --> 01:55:24,943
But there may be a reason for that.

1343
01:55:25,183 --> 01:55:28,325
And I'm hoping the Collins Center will clarify and tell me.

1344
01:55:29,026 --> 01:55:32,248
But that doesn't mean they can't be re-elected, right?

1345
01:55:32,548 --> 01:55:35,210
It's just saying that they aren't being re-elected.

1346
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:35,650
Right.

1347
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:39,253
But what it tells the voter is that they've already served in the position.

1348
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:47,712
And that's the whole thing because when you go to the polls, now there will be some people who will say, I don't want to vote for anybody who's already been there.

1349
01:55:47,953 --> 01:55:49,433
I'm only going to vote for new people.

1350
01:55:49,994 --> 01:55:50,374
Okay.

1351
01:55:50,894 --> 01:56:04,682
On the other hand, there will also be people going to the polls who saying, well, I want my, you know, I'm going to keep with people who've, who've already been doing the role because, because they've gained a certain amount of education or whatever.

1352
01:56:04,782 --> 01:56:04,903
So.

1353
01:56:05,743 --> 01:56:12,027
you know, usually if you get to put candidate for reelection, that's seen as a positive by a candidate.

1354
01:56:13,748 --> 01:56:28,377
And so I was just wondering about, well, you know, someone who fills just, you know, they come in and, you know, they fill it, you know, how does, what's fair?

1355
01:56:28,878 --> 01:56:28,998
So,

1356
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,882
To me, it's more a question of accuracy, because they haven't been elected, so they can't be re-elected.

1357
01:56:36,382 --> 01:56:46,567
Is there a different word you could use, like current member or something, like on the ballot, so that it's not saying that they are elected, but that they are currently on the ballot?

1358
01:56:46,587 --> 01:56:49,669
Right, so I think that's a great alternative.

1359
01:56:49,749 --> 01:56:51,290
I just haven't come up with the wording yet.

1360
01:56:51,893 --> 01:56:57,537
Okay, so let's, I'm sorry to cut you off, but we have three minutes and I want to have time for public participation.

1361
01:56:58,898 --> 01:56:59,658
So thank you.

1362
01:56:59,798 --> 01:57:00,699
This is awesome.

1363
01:57:00,939 --> 01:57:07,383
And what I would like to do is, I mean, we still, we didn't get to articles seven, eight, and six.

1364
01:57:08,284 --> 01:57:13,107
So we're going to look at those at the next meeting, but we may do the school committee piece first.

1365
01:57:15,208 --> 01:57:36,179
What I would like to do is, I don't know if the subcommittee is planning to meet again, but what I would do is maybe send this document and maybe share what the Collins Center said, and then we can do the same process where people can study that and make proposals, and then we can try to agree on things.

1366
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:38,140
Does that sound reasonable?

1367
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,142
I need to take some time to see what the Collins Center said.

1368
01:57:41,942 --> 01:57:48,546
Yeah, that's why I didn't know if you guys were going to meet again and consider that and then submit a new document, but it's up to you.

1369
01:57:49,527 --> 01:57:50,387
We're not sure yet.

1370
01:57:51,048 --> 01:57:51,428
How are we?

1371
01:57:52,632 --> 01:57:53,232
No, we're not.

1372
01:57:53,252 --> 01:57:53,733
Not sure.

1373
01:57:54,353 --> 01:57:58,435
We just got the call-in center thing, just came in 4.30 this afternoon.

1374
01:57:58,455 --> 01:58:00,355
Yeah, we're not sure yet.

1375
01:58:00,656 --> 01:58:02,877
So we do have a meeting in two weeks.

1376
01:58:02,957 --> 01:58:14,922
So, you know, just if you could decide within like, you know, seven or eight days, then we can, you know, give the committee time, whatever, whatever document they're going to get to have to look at, we'll give them.

1377
01:58:15,242 --> 01:58:17,923
The problem is I can't necessarily do a meeting in between.

1378
01:58:20,905 --> 01:58:25,026
Sorry, I keep on changing your name because I've got another friend.

1379
01:58:26,027 --> 01:58:28,508
I'll send out what Milda sent to me to you guys.

1380
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:29,749
Okay, good.

1381
01:58:30,289 --> 01:58:32,930
Yeah.

1382
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:36,812
Then ultimately, we'll send that and the document to the committee.

1383
01:58:36,952 --> 01:58:38,092
Aubrey, what were you going to say?

1384
01:58:38,813 --> 01:58:43,875
Just a clarifying question about when we are reading this document, we should be reading it,

1385
01:58:44,938 --> 01:58:47,439
What are we voting in sections?

1386
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:52,001
Well, what we've been doing, I mean, we could do that.

1387
01:58:52,041 --> 01:59:00,644
We could go through section by section, or we could just say that if anybody, what I've been doing, which is if you have a proposal, bring it.

1388
01:59:00,744 --> 01:59:12,348
So if somebody doesn't want to do the composition, for instance, that you guys recommended, they would say, I propose that we have an all at large school committee, and then we would discuss that and vote on it.

1389
01:59:14,456 --> 01:59:20,437
But if nobody has an issue with it and they're fine with it, then nobody's going to bring up a proposal.

1390
01:59:20,457 --> 01:59:21,397
Does that make sense?

1391
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:30,799
Melva, can you pass that call-in center document to everyone so we all have a chance to read it?

1392
01:59:30,959 --> 01:59:31,240
Yes.

1393
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:38,081
Before the next meeting, everybody will get the Article 4 in the call-in center's comments.

1394
01:59:38,661 --> 01:59:42,482
Melva, I don't have all of that, so could you send it out to everybody?

1395
01:59:43,603 --> 01:59:44,463
I don't have her.

1396
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:52,066
Well, what I would like you guys to do is share the Google Doc of Article 4, and then I'll send the Collins Center.

1397
01:59:52,266 --> 01:59:54,447
It's in our Google Drive.

1398
01:59:54,467 --> 01:59:59,108
And I don't know, because I didn't create it, so I don't know if I can share it with everybody.

1399
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:01,569
But I think I can, since it was shared with me, right?

1400
02:00:02,509 --> 02:00:04,550
Yeah, it's in subcommittees, Article 4.

1401
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:05,090
OK.

1402
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:06,251
I'll share all that.

1403
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:06,951
OK.

1404
02:00:07,251 --> 02:00:12,013
Aubrey, if I sent you the Collins Center one, could you then put it in our Google Drive?

1405
02:00:12,573 --> 02:00:12,733
Yes.

1406
02:00:13,695 --> 02:00:15,416
Okay, I'll do that now.

1407
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:18,556
Okay, do we have any members of the public that would like to speak?

1408
02:00:21,857 --> 02:00:34,281
Okay, so we have two meetings in May and we have a lot to get through, but once we get through article four, I am hoping the other articles won't take as long, but we'll see.

1409
02:00:36,842 --> 02:00:39,983
All right, does anyone want to make a motion to adjourn?

1410
02:00:40,715 --> 02:00:42,436
I make a motion that we adjourn the meeting.

1411
02:00:42,956 --> 02:00:43,276
Second.

1412
02:00:43,416 --> 02:00:43,796
Second.

1413
02:00:44,096 --> 02:00:45,257
Did you want to say something, Aubrey?

1414
02:00:46,938 --> 02:00:48,618
No, you were just... No, I'm sorry.

1415
02:00:48,638 --> 02:00:51,079
I didn't want to stop you, Jim, and go ahead and hold it.

1416
02:00:51,099 --> 02:00:56,962
But do we have to do anything with the subcommittee that was voted on earlier tonight?

1417
02:00:57,102 --> 02:01:01,184
We tabled that for next meeting, so we'll revisit it.

1418
02:01:02,564 --> 02:01:02,864
All right.

1419
02:01:03,225 --> 02:01:03,985
Good night, everybody.
