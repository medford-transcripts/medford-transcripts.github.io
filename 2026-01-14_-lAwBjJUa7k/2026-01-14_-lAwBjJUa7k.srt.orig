00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,282
[SPEAKER_12]: 13 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

164
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,763
[SPEAKER_12]: The invoices are approved.

165
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

166
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to keep turning it over to left field.

167
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:54,129
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to talk to us about a contract amendment that they are recommending for our approval this evening.

168
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, can you go to the amendment slide and show me right after the announcement?

169
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever it was, right?

170
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

171
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is a little difficult to read here.

172
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a latest budget update.

173
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're obviously still well within budget.

174
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to apologize.

175
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:25,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot read it from here, but it was distributed

176
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, to everybody, uh, in the, in the latest packet.

177
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:37,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but all, all things said, everything is still within budget and tracking exactly where we anticipated.

178
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Next slide.

179
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:40,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

180
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:50,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so just before I hand it over to SMMA, I just, I did want to note when I had initially sent this amendment out, I had noted it was for geotechnical work.

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It is actually geo environmental work.

182
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I just wanted to clarify that.

183
00:10:55,677 --> 00:11:00,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also just to note, this does not increase the feasibility study budget.

184
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,762
[SPEAKER_04]: This is simply transferring funds, uh, from our other category up into SMMAs, uh, contract.

185
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then it's also, um, we're also seeking approval to submit a budget revision request to the MSBA.

186
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:22,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is simply an accounting exercise with the MSBA showing them where we're, we're moving money, uh, that's been approved for, for any amendment.

187
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

188
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let SOMA kind of get into a little bit more of the detail on what the amendment is for.

189
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:28,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

190
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:40,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So our geoenvironmental engineer was contracted to do a phase one assessment on the site, which is mostly research and speaking to people who have knowledge.

191
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:48,710
[SPEAKER_10]: And based on that information, it was determined that there's enough concern to need a phase two.

192
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:55,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Fortunately, we have the ability to piggyback on, and this is maybe why Matt thought this was a geotechnical.

193
00:11:55,971 --> 00:12:02,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Our geotechnical engineers have started work on the site with some test pits and test pourings.

194
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:11,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we have the ability for our geoenvironmental engineer to be out there witnessing the soils, being able to do sampling at the same time.

195
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:16,379
[SPEAKER_10]: So originally, this number was about twice in our other reimbursables budget.

196
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:24,918
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, because we're able to piggyback on the other work, this is the total request for phase two services.

197
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions about that?

198
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to clarify, it's not an upper to the total value, but it's an allocation from, is it a reserve budget or is it something else?

199
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:40,743
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it called?

200
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:42,897
[SPEAKER_03]: PB, David Ensign — He's being reallocated.

201
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,138
[SPEAKER_12]: PB, David Ensign — Yeah, the other category.

202
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:49,621
[SPEAKER_12]: PB, David Ensign — Yeah, this category is called... Yeah.

203
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:53,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's built into the feasibility budget for these items.

204
00:12:53,843 --> 00:13:02,888
[SPEAKER_04]: If we need additional geotechnical, if we need additional estimating services, it's just essentially a contingency within the feasibility that we can pull from if needed.

205
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:03,789
[SPEAKER_03]: PB, David Ensign — Okay.

206
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a ceiling in the other category?

207
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,831
[SPEAKER_04]: PB, David Ensign — Yes.

208
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:09,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to know what it is.

209
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,540
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, but yes, there is.

210
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all within the total $3 million of the feasibility study.

211
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,264
Thank you.

212
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:18,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions?

213
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to approve the amendment?

214
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:25,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve.

215
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:27,272
[SPEAKER_12]: By Aaron.

216
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

217
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

218
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:30,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Second by Joan.

219
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:32,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Call the roll.

220
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Jenny Graham, yes.

221
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor Lungo Kern.

222
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Galussi?

223
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

224
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:38,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Marta Cabral, yes.

225
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Joan Bowen, yes.

226
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:41,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Ken Lord, yes.

227
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:42,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Libby Brown, yes.

228
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:43,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Marissa Desmond, yes.

229
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:47,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Brea Dorsey, yes.

230
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Brian Hilliard, yes.

231
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily Lozaro, yes.

232
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Malone, yes.

233
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Nicole Morrell, yes.

234
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Karen Olapode, yes.

235
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Ruth Preissner, yes.

236
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,741
[SPEAKER_12]: 13 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

237
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,401
[SPEAKER_12]: The amendment is approved.

238
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:04,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

239
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,702
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're finally to the exciting stuff.

240
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:13,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to turn it over to the SMB team because they have been working really tirelessly.

241
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:23,193
[SPEAKER_12]: But before I do that, I just wanted to mention that what we're going to see tonight are sort of like a jumping off point.

242
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:27,957
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll actually see quite a number of options.

243
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,840
[SPEAKER_12]: I was frankly shocked at how many options that you all came up with.

244
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,303
[SPEAKER_12]: But the goal for tonight is,

245
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,130
[SPEAKER_12]: to help us get an understanding of what is possible on this site.

246
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:53,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever advances out of this meeting this evening is what will be sent to the cost estimators for their very initial estimate, which is required to be submitted with our PDP submission at the end of February.

247
00:14:53,073 --> 00:15:01,035
[SPEAKER_12]: The SMMA team will talk a little bit about context, but just to set the framing,

248
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,954
[SPEAKER_12]: should take a vote on something at the end of the evening.

249
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:15,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And it could be that we take a vote to advance all these options forward, unless there's something really problematic happening.

250
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,599
[SPEAKER_12]: But we'll get there sort of towards the end.

251
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,321
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to turn it over to SMMA.

252
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:27,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And then for those who are on Zoom, there will be an interactive way for you to all provide your thoughts in this process.

253
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:31,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the room, we're going to welcome you to do the same on the phone.

254
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:40,237
[SPEAKER_12]: So you might just want to get hooked up to the guest network because that'll be the easiest way to do it while we get started and listen to some of the context we're bringing.

255
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:43,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to turn it over to the team.

256
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,103
[SPEAKER_17]: So I might start just with that sort of logistical point.

257
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,045
[SPEAKER_17]: For folks that are in the room, there are

258
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,681
[SPEAKER_17]: to our codes that are sitting in front of you.

259
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:57,783
[SPEAKER_17]: We're actually presenting using a tool called Mentimeter today, which is a digital interactive platform.

260
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:04,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the reason why we have some fun little icons floating around our screen that you'll see as we move forward.

261
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:13,565
[SPEAKER_17]: For folks that are online, we're going to get to the point in the presentation just before we jump into the different cost alternatives that we're going to present.

262
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,326
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll give you an opportunity to log in then as well.

263
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:25,350
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just giving folks a little bit more time online to get ready for it, but there's really no need for interaction until we get to the actual cost alternative portion.

264
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,571
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean don't give you a thumbs down right now?

265
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,853
[SPEAKER_17]: You can give me a thumbs down.

266
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,874
[SPEAKER_17]: I can take it right now.

267
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:34,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably for the internet connection is unstable.

268
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:39,001
[SPEAKER_17]: You can give a thumbs down.

269
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And not saying that personally to Ken.

270
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,094
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the portion of the agenda that we're going to run through.

271
00:16:47,114 --> 00:17:02,778
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a small predecessor to this as well that we're going to start with, which is just giving everyone a quick update on the status of the programming work that we've been doing, which drives the overall size of the building, which in turn drives these cost alternatives.

272
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,398
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get into why that's important as we move forward.

273
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,260
[SPEAKER_17]: But really what we're going to run through is a fair number of options, which you'll see.

274
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:16,830
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all going to fall into 1 of these 3 categories of either a code upgrade option.

275
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,492
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition, renovation option, or a new building option.

276
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:27,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are the 3 baseline options that need to be submitted to the as part of our report.

277
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:33,460
[SPEAKER_17]: We've gone way above sort of that minimum of 3, but that is sort of the baseline that we're going to be look at.

278
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's going to be the lens through which we're going to start looking at all the different options.

279
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:39,064
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 1 of those 3 different categories.

280
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we're then going to sort of integrate in this interactive session.

281
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:48,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and we're also going to be able to feel comments, um, on the options after we get through them.

282
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:55,793
[SPEAKER_17]: We do want to try to get through all of them as opposed to stopping and fielding questions as we go, um, just to maintain the continuity.

283
00:17:55,813 --> 00:18:01,417
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can understand, um, each alternative, um, with respect to the other ones as we're moving through them.

284
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, All right.

285
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody gave a thumbs up, which I appreciate.

286
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,982
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

287
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:08,883
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to move.

288
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:13,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the program area update.

289
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:27,400
[SPEAKER_17]: What we've been doing over the course of the past couple of months is really been building up into this point and really allowing us to determine what the target size of the building is going to be.

290
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:33,524
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a slide that we've shown at various visioning processes at the programming meetings that we've had.

291
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:39,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really sort of outlines the process of how we start from not knowing anything to knowing what the building size is going to be.

292
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:43,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Right so we're running a couple of concurrent activities initially.

293
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:56,039
[SPEAKER_17]: One in sort of the visioning track educational visioning where we bring together both educational leadership which was probably about 20 members of school leadership district leadership all coming together.

294
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:09,545
[SPEAKER_17]: We also had educational forums which pulled in larger diverse cross-section of the population within Medford both from the school side including students including families.

295
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:14,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Again the district and school leadership as well but sort of larger community input.

296
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:22,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So all of that is getting pulled together into an educational plan which is sort of the heart of the design of the project.

297
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,960
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is really outlining the goals of the education that is envisioned to happen for the school moving forward.

298
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:35,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's something that is being written by the district which is again a requirement of the MSBA.

299
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,004
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not the design team telling the district or the community.

300
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:43,838
[SPEAKER_17]: what the vision for education is going to be here within the city at the high school.

301
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:52,483
[SPEAKER_17]: It is the community the school community really developing that plan with some frameworks in terms of visioning and activities.

302
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:56,145
[SPEAKER_17]: So while that is all ongoing we're also doing space programming.

303
00:19:56,165 --> 00:20:03,530
[SPEAKER_17]: This is where we went out and we met we had those 49 different meetings with all the current and potential future users of the building.

304
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,152
[SPEAKER_17]: So there were probably over like 250 people that we were meeting with individually.

305
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,476
[SPEAKER_17]: throughout the course of those 49 meetings.

306
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:18,383
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was a lot of conversations, a lot of energy to try to find out, okay, what does everyone need in this building as we move forward from an individual program standpoint?

307
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,145
[SPEAKER_17]: That generated an educational program.

308
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:32,053
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can see in terms of the percentages that are complete down below, we're not done with either of those activities yet, but we're also at the point where we need to start to move forward on these cost alternatives.

309
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:38,630
[SPEAKER_17]: So that we can start to get an idea of the cost overall of the project of all these different options as we go forward.

310
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,571
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're sort of moving these things concurrently as we go.

311
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:48,214
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have enough confidence in terms of where each one of those things is to be able to lead us to the next stages of the process.

312
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:55,418
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the educational plan and the educational program really combine to form this overall building size.

313
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,640
[SPEAKER_17]: which is going to be a gross square footage.

314
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:07,945
[SPEAKER_17]: It's every inch, every square foot of the building that we're going to be in moving forward, again, whether it's an added on to and renovated building or whether it's a completely new building.

315
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:17,150
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that we're doing while we're doing all those other activities in terms of programming and visioning, we're doing this existing building analysis and existing site analysis.

316
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:25,455
[SPEAKER_17]: What we talked about in terms of doing the phase two of geoenvironmental study, we're doing geotechnical studies, we're doing laser scanning,

317
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:27,987
[SPEAKER_17]: hazardous materials.

318
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:34,091
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to try to read off the entire list, but essentially doing that deep dive into the existing building to understand what's here.

319
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:45,739
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, those two things, understanding what's on the site and what's in the building, as well as having that overall size of the building, allows us to then start projecting these very high-level cost alternatives.

320
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,504
[SPEAKER_17]: As we go forward in the process, we're going to talk a little bit about what those are, but I just want to try to give a sense of

321
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:59,002
[SPEAKER_17]: what the building is looking like right now and what's driving all the cost alternatives as we get into it.

322
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:17,457
[SPEAKER_17]: On the left is really a statement of what the educational plan is that Dr. Galluzzi shared at the staff meeting and at the community forum most recently, talking about sort of the process that everyone has been going through in terms of developing that educational plan.

323
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:24,719
[SPEAKER_17]: But in terms of the other pieces that are composed in the existing building, again, we're not assuming anything about this existing building.

324
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,699
[SPEAKER_17]: We're crawling through every inch.

325
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:30,120
[SPEAKER_17]: We're finding every locked door to understand who is using every space.

326
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,301
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been bugging Ken and John to let us in everywhere as we've been going through.

327
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:38,623
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is both ourselves as well as the crew that's been doing the laser scanning.

328
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:43,684
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're getting programmatic understanding as well as the physical understanding of what is here at a very detailed level.

329
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:59,217
[SPEAKER_17]: The educational plan that I talked about is really understanding sort of the educational needs and sort of what that develops into for new programs that are coming here or the existing programs that are here and evolving as we move forward.

330
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:01,779
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a static model of education that we're looking at.

331
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,865
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some spaces that are subject to additional guidelines that we have to follow on the special education front.

332
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:14,299
[SPEAKER_17]: DESE provides a lot of guidance in terms of the sizes of spaces and types of spaces.

333
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:26,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And we combine that with a very close conversation with Joan and her team to understand from a district perspective and a school perspective what is the vision for special education moving forward.

334
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:36,894
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in terms of the Chapter 74 programs again DESE provides specific guidance on the sizing of the shop spaces from a safety perspective.

335
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:41,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Understanding how many students may be in each shop and program moving forward.

336
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:48,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Again we're looking at shops that are here currently as well as the four new shops that are projected to be added to the school moving forward.

337
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:58,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are all the numbers in terms of where we stand right now in terms of net square footage.

338
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,287
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll take a second to explain this a little bit.

339
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:05,230
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to dive into every square footage here at the moment.

340
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Partly because we're still evolving.

341
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:12,633
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still having discussions that refine the proposed net area.

342
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:24,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also still waiting for the results of our laser scan which we're expecting at the beginning of next week which will tune those existing numbers probably like within a percentile or two in terms of what you're seeing here.

343
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Really what we're going to focus on though are sort of where we have big changes.

344
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:34,881
[SPEAKER_17]: On the right hand side we have some percentages of increase or decrease from the existing to the proposed net area.

345
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:40,869
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to take a second and talk about that that term net square footage or net area.

346
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,595
[SPEAKER_17]: That is the usable area for every space that's got in program that's going to be within the building.

347
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:50,277
[SPEAKER_17]: So it does not include things like hallways.

348
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,720
[SPEAKER_17]: It does not include things like toilet rooms or mechanical rooms.

349
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:02,568
[SPEAKER_17]: We take the net area the total sum total of the net floor area and we multiply that by one and a half to get the overall building size and refer to that as the gross floor area.

350
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:11,834
[SPEAKER_17]: But for right now we're just looking at the comparison on a percentage basis of where we were or where we are now really and where we're looking to go in the future.

351
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,377
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to move forward.

352
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:28,748
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a little this is sort of the cheat sheet in terms of where those big swings are just so we can run through and understand why we have those big variations either up or down as we're thinking about the proposed building.

353
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,211
[SPEAKER_17]: The first is on the special education side.

354
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:49,394
[SPEAKER_17]: We are doing a lot of right-sizing for the programs that are here currently and that includes both the sub-separate programs which are dedicated programs where students are in all day long but also the resource rooms where services are provided on a more intermittent basis where students are coming and going from different spaces.

355
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,615
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're right-sizing those.

356
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,096
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also thinking about the future.

357
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:57,078
[SPEAKER_17]: We're understanding the trends again based on discussions with Joan.

358
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:04,774
[SPEAKER_17]: where we're looking to address student need in the future as we go forward.

359
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,175
[SPEAKER_17]: So that in some cases that's increasing room capacity.

360
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,078
[SPEAKER_17]: In some cases it's just thinking about different programs and sort of how they come in.

361
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:22,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally there is the relocation of the Curtis Tufts program the therapeutic day program from a remote site to this building and so that's going to add a certain amount of square footage.

362
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:28,089
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's partly the reason why you see a fairly significant increase in the special education space

363
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,461
[SPEAKER_17]: that we have here today versus where we're going in the future.

364
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,924
[SPEAKER_17]: The second one is the addition of technology labs.

365
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:43,950
[SPEAKER_17]: So the the MSBA refers to these as vocational spaces and it's a little bit confusing because it is not the same as the Chapter 74 vocational spaces.

366
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:57,880
[SPEAKER_17]: They refer to these as really hands-on learning labs and they're spaces that as we've been talking with the educational leadership team as well as the educational forum there's a need here at the school for additional hands-on learning activities.

367
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:22,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether that takes the form of electives that are added to the curriculum and offerings for students or whether that is providing resources for existing curriculum to go and use specialized spaces those those technology labs really will provide a tremendous amount of additional opportunity for project-based for hands-on learning as we go forward whether it's electives or whether it's modification of existing curriculum.

368
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:29,598
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's probably only one or two of those types of spaces in the building right now, like a maker space fits into that category.

369
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:35,759
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a considerable amount of those spaces that are being thought about being added to the overall building program.

370
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:45,021
[SPEAKER_17]: The CTE spaces are almost doubling in size in terms of the square footage that we have for Chapter 74 programs here today.

371
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:50,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, that's a combination of adding four new programs, right, that don't exist today.

372
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,122
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need all that square footage.

373
00:27:52,961 --> 00:28:05,244
[SPEAKER_17]: But also when we look at the enrollment for the CT Chapter 74 programs to make sure that we have that DESE required amount of space for the number of students that are planned to be enrolled.

374
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:05,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

375
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:10,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a tremendous amount of very successful programs here that are growing in enrollment.

376
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:14,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Chad has been able to get some grants to be able to add staff moving forward.

377
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:18,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when we increase the size of the existing program, we have to do two things.

378
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:23,161
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to provide enough space and we have to provide enough staff from a DESE perspective.

379
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:26,122
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're doing both of those things as we're thinking about moving forward.

380
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:30,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the reason for the Chapter 74 programs increasing in space.

381
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:39,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Under the drama category, the auditorium itself, we've heard many times that the existing auditorium is extremely limiting in terms of the number of

382
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:41,908
[SPEAKER_17]: seats that are in there currently.

383
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:52,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So planning for a thousand seat auditorium just results in a very linear sort of increase in terms of the amount of square footage that's associated with it.

384
00:28:52,436 --> 00:29:00,683
[SPEAKER_17]: And then lastly early education in the building right now we have currently Medford Family Network.

385
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:06,187
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Kids Corner and we have the preschool program that's associated with the Chapter 74 early ed program.

386
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:15,301
[SPEAKER_17]: What we're going to be doing is adding to that dramatically by the consolidation of the preschool classrooms throughout the district here.

387
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:20,924
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the MEEP program the Bedford Ed Early Educational Program that will be coming here.

388
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:29,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I think currently we're targeting 11 classrooms I believe as the count of integrated preschool classrooms 15 students per classroom.

389
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's going to relieve stress on the elementary schools where those preschool classrooms are located right now.

390
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:41,385
[SPEAKER_17]: and provide really purpose-built facilities moving forward.

391
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:51,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a big increase in square footage, but the benefit to the city, to the students, the youngest students within the district is really tremendous there as well.

392
00:29:54,653 --> 00:30:01,017
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just a quick graphic that lets you sort of see the increase based on sort of color coding.

393
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:07,781
[SPEAKER_17]: It's another way of looking at that same information that we were just going through anecdotally and from the actual numerical listing of things.

394
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:23,970
[SPEAKER_17]: So I won't spend too much time here other than pointing out the fact that you can see overall, we are looking at an increase in terms of net square footage, program square footage based on the sum total of all the changes that are happening.

395
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:28,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I will point out there's a couple of reductions as well in terms of overall categories.

396
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:39,488
[SPEAKER_17]: The health and PE category is reducing, not because we're suggesting that we're going to be reducing the size of the gym, just because there is a tremendous amount of locker room space underneath your gymnasium.

397
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:43,872
[SPEAKER_17]: It is far and above beyond anything that we have seen in terms of the sizing of it.

398
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,735
[SPEAKER_17]: And quite frankly, a lot of it is completely unusable, right?

399
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,438
[SPEAKER_17]: And so what we're going to be doing is building purposeful

400
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:54,970
[SPEAKER_17]: locker room space that is at the size that the MSBA will allow us to build on the same level as the gymnasium.

401
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,611
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that overall square footage is shrinking down, just as one example.

402
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:03,312
[SPEAKER_17]: But overall, we're looking at a net increase of the net square footage.

403
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:06,753
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

404
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:12,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Matt, before you continue, can you just flash up the Ventimeter link real quick?

405
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:16,796
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a bunch of people who have joined us, and I just want them to be able to connect.

406
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see if I can get to it.

407
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,547
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a couple of slides in here.

408
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:24,849
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

409
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:32,272
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll leave it here for just a second so folks can snap it with their phone to get the QR code.

410
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:39,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Or you can also go to, on the left-hand side here, worldwideweb.menti.com, and you can enter that code.

411
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:41,317
[SPEAKER_17]: That's another way of getting to it if you need to.

412
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:44,919
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ken has just dropped it in the chat as well.

413
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Or somebody dropped it.

414
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:46,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it was Will.

415
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,480
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

416
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:52,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody can give Ken a thumbs up for that.

417
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,502
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll come back to this slide again.

418
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:56,763
[SPEAKER_17]: So you have another opportunity.

419
00:31:56,783 --> 00:32:07,210
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can't catch it right now, again, no need to put the thumbs up on things until we get into the alternatives, but we'll take thumbs up, we'll take thumbs down as we get there.

420
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:11,673
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so cost alternatives.

421
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:19,459
[SPEAKER_17]: This is sort of the tricky part of the meeting in terms of calibrating how we're all thinking and looking at these alternatives as we go forward.

422
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:24,054
[SPEAKER_17]: These are going to look and feel like design options.

423
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:42,084
[SPEAKER_17]: We make a specific distinction between design options and cost alternatives because there is so much in terms of design that we just don't know yet about the building and we can't get into with the number of schemes that we're going to be looking at right now.

424
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:48,208
[SPEAKER_17]: The important thing for us at this stage in the process is to really understand how big the building is

425
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:56,716
[SPEAKER_17]: how much of the building we want to build new or make it as an addition, and how much we want to renovate in terms of existing square footage.

426
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:04,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're just not at the point where the term design is really appropriate to evaluate these.

427
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,121
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a lot of fluctuations.

428
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:10,763
[SPEAKER_17]: This diagram that is up on the screen right now is our attempt to try to explain that a bit.

429
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:21,919
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of the different cost models that we're going to be establishing from these alternatives, they are exclusively based for the building on square footage, square footage of the building.

430
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,063
[SPEAKER_17]: It actually does not matter from an estimating standpoint what shape the building is in.

431
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:33,669
[SPEAKER_17]: All three of these diagrams at this point, if they were considered designs, would be costed at the same square footage.

432
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though they have different surface areas, they have different roof areas, if you think about them as buildings, right?

433
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,236
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just at the point where we need to focus on the square footage.

434
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:46,578
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why the size of the building is so important right now, because it is our one sort of metric that we're following along as we go.

435
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:56,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So as Michael runs through the different alternatives as we come up, you may see forms, shapes of the building that you like, you don't like.

436
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,541
[SPEAKER_17]: You can still react to them.

437
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:58,481
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not saying you can't.

438
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,942
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really a tough thing to separate.

439
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,423
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tough for us as designers to separate ourselves from

440
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Form and looking at that because we're just trained to do this by nature and sometimes we can't help ourselves.

441
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:11,500
[SPEAKER_17]: So we completely understand if people have that lens when they're seeing these.

442
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to point it out as we go through.

443
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:15,364
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to point out again as we go.

444
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:18,408
[SPEAKER_17]: And there may be questions that get asked later on.

445
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,412
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to tie back to this concept that we're looking at square footage.

446
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:26,094
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're looking at high-level cost models and alternatives as opposed to design options.

447
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:29,376
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to take a second and sort of frame that.

448
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:36,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a couple of other sort of framing slides as well before we jump in, just so that people can sort of, again, calibrate the thinking.

449
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,463
[SPEAKER_17]: You will see masses in terms of buildings that are going to fall into sort of one of two general categories, right?

450
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:49,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Buildings that go a little bit taller, buildings that sprawl out a little bit wider in terms of the usage of the site.

451
00:34:50,408 --> 00:35:06,371
[SPEAKER_17]: For our purposes today and sort of moving forward with the cost estimates, the taller buildings allow you to have more site area to work with, whether that's for parking, whether that's for fields, whether it's for other types of outdoor programs associated with any of the programs that are going to be on site, right.

452
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:15,013
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have that balance between building footprint area and site area that the tall buildings have some sort of better equation of in terms of more site area.

453
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:25,356
[SPEAKER_17]: At the same time, as we get to a certain point in terms of the height of the building, we get into something called the high-rise structure, which has some additional construction premiums associated with it.

454
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:30,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will put a slightly higher dollar value associated with once we get to those taller buildings.

455
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:38,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Really anything five stories and above starts to drive that high-rise or premium to the construction.

456
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,220
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

457
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:49,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Another important piece of this and I'm sure this is a it's a tough one for people to wrap their minds around in terms of the phasing of these buildings.

458
00:35:50,268 --> 00:36:07,652
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to look at a lot of options that are building on parts of the existing building as new additions or they're renovating parts of the existing building and trying to think about how that happens while teaching and learning are going on here as well as all the other community uses that happen in this building and on the site.

459
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:12,053
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's sort of mind bending when you start to get into the details of it.

460
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:18,968
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we don't want to be right now is sort of hamstrung or constrained by trying to figure out, well, how are we going to phase that?

461
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:19,668
[SPEAKER_17]: How are we going to do it?

462
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:37,202
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really going to be our job at this point for each of the options as the sort of design professionals to give the cost estimators a number of phases that may be required in terms of duration, in terms of quantity to actually achieve any of the options that we're going to be looking at.

463
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly if people have thoughts and they want to talk about it, that's fine.

464
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:41,125
[SPEAKER_17]: We welcome the comments.

465
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to get into the phasing in terms of the alternatives.

466
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,606
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to run through sort of what the end product is.

467
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:56,873
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of making those things actually happen though in terms of how it drives the cost we do have a couple different options of how we treat it.

468
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:03,957
[SPEAKER_17]: We can potentially have to bring in temporary modular classroom buildings to operate on site.

469
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:11,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So for instance if we were going to take away the library that's here we might have to create a library space temporarily outside somewhere else on the site.

470
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,126
[SPEAKER_17]: That is an additional cost.

471
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,128
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a non-reimbursable cost as well from the MSBA.

472
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,470
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't help fund any temporary measures.

473
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,132
[SPEAKER_17]: We will look for ways to avoid that whenever we can.

474
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:31,357
[SPEAKER_17]: But for some of these options that we're going to look at when we're building right on top of the existing building, there may be no way of avoiding it as well.

475
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:33,198
[SPEAKER_17]: It just may be a necessary part of the process.

476
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Just be aware that phasing is going to have to happen for a lot of these options.

477
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,756
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be accounting for the cost of those as we move forward through them.

478
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,664
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, and then just a little bit about the structure organization of the different options.

479
00:37:52,725 --> 00:38:04,817
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to try and tell you what the colors are there, but the largest piece of mass that you see there, right, we've collected together four academic classrooms, CTE classrooms, special education space,

480
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,694
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about what programs are where at this point in time.

481
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:12,617
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really about the volume the quantity of square footage that we have.

482
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,660
[SPEAKER_17]: We have gone ahead a little bit contradictory to that.

483
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:26,147
[SPEAKER_17]: We have gone ahead and shown where some of the bigger spaces are so you can see the scale of them and the fact that they're double height or sometimes triple height spaces just for relative purposes.

484
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:34,894
[SPEAKER_17]: But again I wouldn't hinge or thumbs up or thumbs down upon where you see any of those parts and pieces because they can move around they will move around.

485
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:41,961
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just put in there for reference purposes to illustrate that we're capturing that square footage and to help give a little bit of scale to the overall mass.

486
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:54,813
[SPEAKER_17]: In all cases, whether we're looking at addition renovation options, whether we're looking at all new construction options, that proposed net area is going to be the same.

487
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:57,374
[SPEAKER_17]: in terms of what we're looking at.

488
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:58,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's going to be taller.

489
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's going to be wider.

490
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:03,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's going to be mixed into existing construction versus new construction in different ways.

491
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:16,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably the one exception to that will be when we get to new construction options because the gymnasium that we're going to be showing you in those new construction options cannot be as big as the existing gymnasium here.

492
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,921
[SPEAKER_17]: So that existing gym is about 30,000 square feet.

493
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,662
[SPEAKER_17]: A new gymnasium

494
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,994
[SPEAKER_17]: that we can build will be a maximum of 18,000 square feet.

495
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,496
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's like 12,000 square foot delta in between.

496
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:33,081
[SPEAKER_17]: But generally, it's sort of apples to apples in terms of square footage.

497
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,444
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, Kate, I just want to talk real quickly about the site.

498
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:43,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt just explained how the buildings are color coded, and you're going to see some options for the site that are similarly color coded.

499
00:39:43,682 --> 00:40:13,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The goal here is not to show you a fixed location for any items, but just to give you a sense at a squint of what parts of the site are dedicated to green, so fields and planting, what parts of the site are dedicated to pavement and circulation of vehicles and parking in gray, and what parts of the site are more actively programmed with gathering spaces, hangout spaces, entry spaces, CTE yard, outdoor spaces, and the required outdoor play areas for the preschool component.

500
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:18,864
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll see those color coded and just like the building, don't get too fixated on where they are.

501
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:23,728
[SPEAKER_11]: What we're trying to do is just show you what couldn't fit in some of these different scenarios.

502
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:28,911
[SPEAKER_11]: On the next slide, you'll see just a couple of cost assumptions as it relates to site.

503
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Primarily the big drivers here are how much surface parking we want to accommodate.

504
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:44,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Each of the schemes that you're going to see, just like the building is fixed in size, each of the schemes that you're going to see is showing a fixed quantity of parking, which more or less matches what you have today.

505
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:51,721
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still fine tuning whether that number needs to grow or whether it could possibly shrink in terms of number of cars that need to park on site every day.

506
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,103
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, we've assumed it's roughly the same.

507
00:40:54,759 --> 00:41:00,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you're going to see a balance of some schemes that illustrate all that parking in a surface condition like you have today.

508
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:16,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Some schemes that deck over that parking to provide an additional space for fields or program and some schemes that actually go as far as building a parking garage to conserve more of the landscape for fields and other high school and community programming.

509
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:21,083
[SPEAKER_11]: As just as Matt said, there is a cost implication to that.

510
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:25,183
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's what some of the schemes we'll be exploring from a cost perspective.

511
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:28,024
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, there's a lot of flexibility about where things go.

512
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:35,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really that proportion of parking and where it sits relative to grade that will determine what you can fit in terms of other programs.

513
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:41,966
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

514
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:45,287
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm probably going to turn it over to Michael in a second.

515
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:50,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to reiterate sort of the goal of what we're doing as we look through these options.

516
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:55,214
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to come out of this meeting today picking one of these options, right?

517
00:41:55,555 --> 00:42:05,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Really what we want to know is whether or not we have missed any option that like potentially anyone out there is dreaming of and maybe doesn't see in the series of options that we present.

518
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:13,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Or if there's something that people see that says, geez, there's no way that Medford will accept this type of option moving forward.

519
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:17,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and we just want to take it off the table and not even get it cost estimated.

520
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:19,858
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the other thing that we want to try to achieve here.

521
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:32,922
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to probably be working with the general balance, the number of options that we have, but it's really whether or not we're sort of missing anything, um, or whether or not something that we're showing is just sort of like a bridge too far in terms of the concepts of what we're showing.

522
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:40,705
[SPEAKER_17]: So try to keep that, um, mindset as we go through, in addition to using the Mentimeter, um, tool to sort of, um, just

523
00:42:41,506 --> 00:42:45,410
[SPEAKER_17]: voice support or displeasure with any of the options that we're showing.

524
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:55,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to take that one for you?

525
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I could just go through A will be the code upgrade.

526
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:03,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We've grouped B and C. Those are all renovation and mission.

527
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,188
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference with C is it's

528
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:13,835
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily focuses on saving the gymnasium athletics piece, but pretty much the rest of the school is demolished in that scheme.

529
00:43:14,736 --> 00:43:23,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why those two are, you know, we show for there's only the MSBA three pre-reg and pre-submitted, and D is the new construction.

530
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:27,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this next slide is our little quick pause here from Endymeter again.

531
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:31,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Just make sure you speak up or it'll be gone soon.

532
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:31,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

533
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:49,569
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anyone, as we get through a certain point, if people don't see the link in the chat as well, in terms of the code, just feel free to, I guess, ping Will.

534
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:57,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I can flash it up on screen again, the QR code, if that's helpful, if necessary, as we're going along, just so that people have additional access to it.

535
00:43:57,213 --> 00:44:01,395
[SPEAKER_17]: But we'll leave that there for a second, and we're going to jump in.

536
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,937
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll jump right in.

537
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:07,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's 57 studies here.

538
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:17,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine between the, you know, the kind of four different rows here, there's a lot of variations that you can create with buildings.

539
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:24,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, with that cost lens, what we tried to do was consolidate like-minded approaches.

540
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we go back to that one slide that showed the different shape of the square footage, you know,

541
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:34,790
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, these three are very similar.

542
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,112
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to come out with the same cost.

543
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:41,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's consolidate those ideas into a single one for a cost estimate.

544
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:46,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go through 29 different variations here.

545
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:55,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The easiest one to understand with the simplest graphic is code upgrade and just flashing up what that means.

546
00:44:56,404 --> 00:45:01,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the systems, whether they be electrical or structural or plumbing, bringing those up to code.

547
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:09,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And then things like ADA, electrical, fire safety, bring all those up the code.

548
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:13,022
[SPEAKER_02]: What's excluded is changing your spaces.

549
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:17,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't turn your library into classrooms or cafeterias.

550
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:22,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Every space that's in this building today stays the same, but the same function.

551
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's excluded.

552
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:29,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you're going to be seeing for all the options here.

553
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:36,668
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a large aerial axon diagram of a floor plan of the site.

554
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:44,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some stats here in the lower left corner that talk about the height, maybe something about the linear square feet of wall.

555
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:50,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting to get into thinking about horizontal travel distances.

556
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:58,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So quick question, when we see that red boundary, can we trust that that boundary has been confirmed by your survey team?

557
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: or is that still a notional property value?

558
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a notional property value.

559
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:11,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're still waiting for the final land survey, the professional land survey to get back to us.

560
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,517
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just been a very big site, as everybody knows, and there's a lot to it.

561
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:21,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's expected probably within a month or so, but this is a very good approximation.

562
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:24,398
[SPEAKER_17]: This is from GIS, so it's bold.

563
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:30,202
[SPEAKER_17]: It just doesn't have the level of sort of inch specificity that we'll eventually get from the professional.

564
00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:38,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing really much to talk about on this slide, just that the whole building is upgraded.

565
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a light upgrade, like we're talking about.

566
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting energy code, so it's probably removing much, if not all, of the facades and putting new facades on the buildings.

567
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:55,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just coming in and cleaning things up.

568
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big, heavy lift.

569
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:13,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MSBA does, in some circumstances, the code upgrade sometimes works for school districts, but based on what we're learning in the educational plan and the statement of interest, it's unlikely that

570
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:17,019
[SPEAKER_02]: school today is going to meet all those goals.

571
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll jump into the B options.

572
00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:25,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The B series is really where the options proliferate.

573
00:47:26,164 --> 00:47:28,585
[SPEAKER_02]: This school is made up of many different buildings.

574
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:34,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine the different combinations of let's renovate this wing, let's demolish this wing.

575
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:38,710
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hundreds of those variations that you can come up with.

576
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've really tried to throw out the ones that just don't make sense.

577
00:47:44,783 --> 00:47:50,364
[SPEAKER_02]: and stick to the ones that are a little bit more logical and that play out.

578
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:59,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go through the B series and I'll try to explain exactly what's going on in them.

579
00:48:00,966 --> 00:48:09,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first, the B1 series, this is saying that every square foot of this building is renovated.

580
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,928
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember that diagram that showed

581
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:15,165
[SPEAKER_02]: existing square footage versus proposed square footage.

582
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It essentially means that we're adding square footage to this building to meet the program.

583
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:27,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be a whole other floor.

584
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:36,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the colors aren't great in the room, but when you see it on the screen later, it's adding one entire floor to the building.

585
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And additionally,

586
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:46,963
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of padding out some of the CTE shops with additional 20 feet of space all the way around to help that.

587
00:48:48,284 --> 00:48:54,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So B1.1, B1.2 is just saying, let's try to go vertically.

588
00:48:54,886 --> 00:49:05,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So adding two more floors on top of a science wing, up on a cafeteria and athletics corridor there.

589
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of square footage that you're adding

590
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:09,929
[SPEAKER_02]: to this place already.

591
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the B1 and B1.2 options.

592
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:24,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So B2, this is demolishing the auditorium arts wing.

593
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:34,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start to see, we start doing things like that, that we're able to take advantage of more of the site area for new construction.

594
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these focus on the front parking lot.

595
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:45,743
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of space there that you could build a lot of a new school, well, the existing school stays in function.

596
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:56,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd still have to go through a phase renovation to bring this whole building on par with other code requirements.

597
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are just different flavors as I flip back.

598
00:50:03,188 --> 00:50:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: One, some of these are a little bit more spread out, taking up a little bit more site area.

599
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:13,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are saying, can we be a little bit more compact in our footprint, build up a few more stories?

600
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:17,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of a theme that runs through a lot of these.

601
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,036
[SPEAKER_02]: B2.1, B2.2 is somewhere spread out.

602
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are some are a little bit taller.

603
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:26,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, hey, Luke.

604
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:36,116
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to try to hold questions until he gets to like roll through all of these because It's going to break up his ability to enact one to the next to the next.

605
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:42,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So everyone can just hold their questions until I girls done or if you have a stopping point where you want to pause.

606
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:50,360
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine, but When we did this, it was very, very useful to just keep going and let us ask questions at the end.

607
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:52,907
[SPEAKER_03]: For what it's worth, I'm not asking about content.

608
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know how to interpret some things that I see.

609
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:58,890
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can say pretty good.

610
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:01,951
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to add here, Michael.

611
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:09,675
[SPEAKER_17]: So people will recall that the high-rise consideration and why B1, B2.1, and 2.2 are different from one another.

612
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:13,377
[SPEAKER_17]: This gets into that above five stories, right?

613
00:51:13,397 --> 00:51:15,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So that construction will have a higher premium to it.

614
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:25,554
[SPEAKER_17]: So even though it looks very similar in terms of where it is, because it's a taller approach versus a sprawl approach, that's why it's sort of discrete cost model, if you will.

615
00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:26,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a very basic question.

616
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:30,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Does pool services mean like pooled services or aquatics?

617
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,075
[SPEAKER_17]: The pool and the associated locker room that are around it.

618
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:34,796
[SPEAKER_17]: We can probably find a better term than that.

619
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's shrug along here.

620
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:41,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see a theme.

621
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:45,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pulling more of the existing building down, so it's opening up

622
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:50,673
[SPEAKER_02]: more opportunity for new construction in those areas.

623
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:53,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the B.3 options.

624
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:58,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see a lot of these are focusing on that front parking lot.

625
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And even as we've been doing these early studies, we're finding, if you think about like the center of gravity of the school, and if so much remains, we're trying to find places for new construction that doesn't

626
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't try to spread out even further than it is.

627
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:29,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the things that are those interesting findings that will help when we eventually get to design and we're evaluating options, we'll be able to say, well, this one is just too far apart.

628
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:35,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would we put a building here when other options might be a little bit more compact?

629
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:39,673
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases,

630
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:45,709
[SPEAKER_02]: dipping a little bit into, you know, things that we're noticing about the building.

631
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:51,730
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the science wing, the roof was not great and the daylight to those spaces is not great.

632
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:59,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some of these schemes, you will see, you know, carving out some of this existing space to bring in daylight.

633
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a taller version of that.

634
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:27,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So B.4 is demolish A, B, and C, leaving the vocational wing, leaving cafeteria, the athletics corridor, and the gymnasium.

635
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:39,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you can see there's a little bit more freedom of where you can put stuff eventually, but still, as a reminder, these are all phased construction.

636
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:46,868
[SPEAKER_02]: new footprint is overlapping that you're going to build what you can on the first day one.

637
00:53:46,888 --> 00:53:55,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to move students, hopefully, into that new facility, demolish a part of the school, build a little bit more.

638
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an arduous process to go through that.

639
00:54:00,796 --> 00:54:02,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been done before.

640
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:10,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, just focusing on getting that amount of square footage

641
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,130
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the site.

642
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:27,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And B.5 saves the science wing, athletics, and demolishes the rest of the wings.

643
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see five-story school that's tying into those existing pieces.

644
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:40,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And that too will become

645
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:43,399
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the design challenges.

646
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:52,465
[SPEAKER_02]: If we decide some pieces are worth saving for whatever reason, you know, it starts to set the tone for what it attaches to them eventually.

647
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does start to develop a, you know, kind of see this as a very similar character to what's here today.

648
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just taller.

649
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:06,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Different ways to achieve that.

650
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:11,238
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a little bit more spread out on the site for story building.

651
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:24,698
[SPEAKER_02]: B6 demolishes everything besides the C wing, which is the main academic, like 36 classrooms in the C wing.

652
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:40,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you can see that, again, building on that, taking advantage of the parking lot a little bit, and then figuring out a way to tie back to the gymnasium and the renovated program.

653
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,289
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit different flavor of that.

654
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:03,333
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of taking out the southern part, leaving one of the CTE shop spaces.

655
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, these are all kind of all very similar, but it just, for cost purposes, it's gonna tell us a lot, you know, what it takes

656
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:29,752
[SPEAKER_02]: that portion add on to it.

657
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:32,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, spreading art to school.

658
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:38,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Even thinking about things like the three-minute passing sign.

659
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:44,039
[SPEAKER_02]: How fast can stations walk from one end to the other will eventually

660
00:56:45,564 --> 00:56:47,345
[SPEAKER_02]: come into consideration on these.

661
00:56:50,488 --> 00:57:07,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And B.8, rebuilding where all the shop spaces are, still saving the science wing, saving the core academic wing.

662
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:18,661
[SPEAKER_02]: different variations, maybe starting to break out of that orthogonal grid there.

663
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:26,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So all very challenging, but it's a good exercise.

664
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:37,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to get, you may hate some of those, but you may want the price for some of those just to maybe support that and to

665
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:43,955
[SPEAKER_02]: and so maybe eventually toss that one off to the side.

666
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the other aspect.

667
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these may not care for it, but it may be good to build up the knowledge of what these things cost.

668
00:57:55,221 --> 00:58:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next series, we're going to look at just saving the gym, some of these, the pool, and this liner with some of the cafe

669
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:11,419
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen, and then the gymnastics.

670
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:12,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's saving that piece.

671
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:18,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, when you think about saving that piece, it kind of opens up the site a little bit.

672
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:28,435
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really three or four, there's really three primary locations, which is the parking lot, which will be this first series for building new.

673
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:33,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a code upgrade to the gym, and then

674
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:51,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is kind of familiar to some of the earlier schemes, but again, this would be trying to build substantial piece on the parking lot, demolishing parts of the existing school, and a future base, stitching the two together with new construction.

675
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of see what it's doing, right?

676
00:58:56,442 --> 00:59:00,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to build on that front parking lot, the school's getting really long.

677
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: This is trying to be a little bit more compact.

678
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:13,715
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is probably a real challenge to do, as most of it is right on top of existing school.

679
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:16,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So this phase-in would be really intense.

680
00:59:18,116 --> 00:59:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But good to get a cost understanding for this model.

681
00:59:25,577 --> 00:59:29,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were thinking about, well, we have the gymnasium.

682
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the front parking lot in these schemes.

683
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about trying to develop maybe an option that just, it may not be ideal, but treating the gymnasium as a separate building so that you could build a lot more square footage up front while the school still functions in the middle and then stitch it back together with fields.

684
00:59:54,238 --> 01:00:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a lot of them were saying, we have to connect to the gym and have to make it so

685
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,438
[SPEAKER_02]: people can travel for an interior environment.

686
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:10,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's a good cost option to think about separating two.

687
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:25,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first one that introduces demolishing the pool building, which we know has challenges and has maintenance that will need to happen probably for the life of that building to keep it up and running.

688
01:00:25,631 --> 01:00:32,835
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the first one that breaks that out, such as that as a separate project for the district, for the city.

689
01:00:33,245 --> 01:00:43,833
[SPEAKER_17]: And just from a costing perspective, we will be looking at the pool, either renovating the existing pool or building a new pool, as sort of an a la carte item so we can understand what the costs of those are.

690
01:00:44,214 --> 01:00:56,944
[SPEAKER_17]: But in a lot of these options, we can be thinking about either a renovation or a new pool building as something that we can take or leave in terms of different options.

691
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:58,465
[SPEAKER_17]: And so you don't need to necessarily

692
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:12,150
[SPEAKER_17]: like an option or dislike it based on the pool that was there in that whatever version it is, whether standalone or even the location of it on-site, like we're showing in a particular location here, that may move around in the future as we go.

693
01:01:12,571 --> 01:01:18,534
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just trying to understand what are the options that we have to work with if we think about the pool as being a new building.

694
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:19,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

695
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:22,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It does do some interesting things on-site.

696
01:01:22,196 --> 01:01:27,059
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that back corner where you're coming around the pool up to the field is pretty tough.

697
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:30,645
[SPEAKER_02]: of vehicular drive back through there.

698
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:38,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So site two is kind of, it's like the side saddle, it's the western side of the site.

699
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It has its own, every site has its own challenges.

700
01:01:41,492 --> 01:01:55,341
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has a lot of topography as you see in the photo, but it's suggesting a school building that's a little bit building behind the gym and a little bit maybe in front of the gym, maybe taking advantage

701
01:01:56,207 --> 01:02:02,309
[SPEAKER_02]: of that upper practice field as well to find some program that can fit up there.

702
01:02:05,071 --> 01:02:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So the challenges with this one, you see it's a seven-story building, and that's really just based on entering kind of at this level that we're sitting at and having the floors that are terracing up to Eggerly Field.

703
01:02:20,476 --> 01:02:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the challenge with all these that are

704
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:28,042
[SPEAKER_02]: entertaining sighting here or in the back.

705
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a different variation on this.

706
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:37,586
[SPEAKER_02]: This one does take advantage of that upper practice field, which is a bit isolated.

707
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's trying to do its best to avoid the existing footprint altogether so that school could remain in use during construction, building gets built,

708
01:02:51,468 --> 01:03:00,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last phase would be to mend the site and recreate the front yard with playing fields and parking.

709
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few options that we'll price.

710
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:08,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we show playing fields over a single parking deck.

711
01:03:09,224 --> 01:03:12,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a few different pricing options.

712
01:03:12,827 --> 01:03:17,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be service parking, a smaller field, there's a few different variations that we'll submit.

713
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: with this one to figure out how to creatively take advantage of.

714
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of area.

715
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would also remove one of the fields from the upper fields.

716
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And then site three.

717
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:42,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's got probably all the same challenges as site two.

718
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a, I'm just going to say like the presence of a school,

719
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:52,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to tuck that much square footage behind a gym.

720
01:03:53,030 --> 01:04:00,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to see it, but there is an access challenge to getting up the back of the site.

721
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:18,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is contemplating a very large school in the back, and then a little bit of work to line the front of the gymnasium bar in with some probably public-facing programs.

722
01:04:18,658 --> 01:04:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but again, this would be a phase construction.

723
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:37,861
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be able to build the school in the back and along the side, demolish those pieces that are attached to the gymnasium, and then build those in a separate phase, and then continue on bringing down the schools toward the front of the site.

724
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few different variations.

725
01:04:44,442 --> 01:04:46,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's the same kind of square footage

726
01:04:52,661 --> 01:05:02,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these are, you know, this one is suggesting maybe try not to, again, connect to the gymnasium while we treat that as a separate building.

727
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:05,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the pool, you know, out of the equation.

728
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:10,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That can go in a separate structure pretty much anywhere on the site.

729
01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:19,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And to figure out, you know, you'll have your hands full with this one trying to figure out how we get

730
01:05:21,056 --> 01:05:25,419
[SPEAKER_02]: 1300 students and families up to the gracious front door.

731
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:39,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a few of these that didn't quite fit those categories, but this one is trying to just really try to make a compact facility.

732
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:42,430
[SPEAKER_02]: This one wraps the gymnasium volume.

733
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same amount of square feet for everyone.

734
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:47,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It, again, is a,

735
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:53,876
[SPEAKER_02]: phase construction since there's a little bit on the south side of the gymnasium that would come into play.

736
01:05:54,277 --> 01:05:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And then moving to school.

737
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:01,883
[SPEAKER_02]: This one also shows a football stadium track in the foreground.

738
01:06:02,703 --> 01:06:06,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few different options for what that surface would be.

739
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And some technical challenges of putting a track over a parking structure as well that would need to be dealt with.

740
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And then D, these are completely new.

741
01:06:21,346 --> 01:06:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing that we're sitting in today remains.

742
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the D1.1 is building school on the parking lot.

743
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that it overlaps the existing school.

744
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:45,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some phasing that happens to allow that to occur.

745
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:50,100
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really tall, this is six stories.

746
01:06:50,200 --> 01:07:04,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to like try to figure out, you know, we have the site, how can we not overlap as much of new schools that we can build majority of it on day one and be able to go back later with smaller beds.

747
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:07,589
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few different options.

748
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a little bit more spread out.

749
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:12,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That previous one was six stories.

750
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:17,175
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fours and see what that does to how much it approaches

751
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: On the school, it's almost connecting back to where the chimneys are.

752
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:26,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of essentially what we have here today.

753
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:32,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a four-story school, but you see how much site area that it takes up.

754
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:41,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have just a few

755
01:07:41,509 --> 01:07:45,491
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new schools on the upper fields.

756
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:54,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So this includes demolishing the gymnasium, and as Matt mentioned before, you won't be able to rebuild that same amount of square feet.

757
01:07:54,975 --> 01:08:00,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be capped at 18,000 square feet for a new gymnasium facility.

758
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:11,002
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I think that's the run of them.

759
01:08:12,445 --> 01:08:16,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we can open it up to conversation.

760
01:08:17,706 --> 01:08:18,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ready for questions?

761
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:20,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Observations, questions.

762
01:08:21,107 --> 01:08:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go back to anything.

763
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:26,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

764
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:36,269
[SPEAKER_12]: For folks, we're going to take questions from the building committee, and then we'll take questions from anybody who is here in person and online, and we'll kind of swap off.

765
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:40,230
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're online, please raise your hand so we know who we need to get to.

766
01:08:41,524 --> 01:08:44,766
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, for the committee, are there questions that people have?

767
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke?

768
01:08:47,288 --> 01:09:01,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So our existing school, which was designed for 3,600 students under different guidelines, but almost 4,000 students, has an existing net area of 341,000 square feet.

769
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:09,401
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposed structure, driven by the factors described at the outset, has a proposed net area

770
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:14,731
[SPEAKER_03]: almost 100,000 square feet larger.

771
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:22,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted to ask, for a lot of these, I'll assume the gross square footage is about the same.

772
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:25,913
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it might be exactly the same for all these different shapes.

773
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:31,194
[SPEAKER_03]: There are different shapes, but is it safe to assume that the gross square footage is the same, A?

774
01:09:31,994 --> 01:09:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then B, what is that gross square footage?

775
01:09:35,549 --> 01:09:45,912
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, with the exception of, again, the gymnasium, right, for those new options, the net square footage will be dropped by the 12,000 square foot or so.

776
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,273
[SPEAKER_17]: But then you have the concept correct.

777
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:55,135
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of the gross square footage, it's a 1.5 multiplier on whatever the net square footage is.

778
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:59,997
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't share it here, again, because we're still both refining the existing square footage.

779
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:03,640
[SPEAKER_17]: net square footage through the laser scanning process.

780
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:10,944
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also still having those programming conversations with the educational leadership and refining educational plans.

781
01:10:10,984 --> 01:10:11,885
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's not final.

782
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:14,806
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're not trying to be evasive in terms of the number.

783
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,308
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still going to move around.

784
01:10:17,408 --> 01:10:21,270
[SPEAKER_17]: And once that number sort of appears, everyone sort of locks in on that number.

785
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:27,314
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to try for this conversation today to focus on really the organization of the options.

786
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:29,495
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, what people think are either

787
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:33,291
[SPEAKER_17]: missing or ones that don't want to be showing up here.

788
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:40,735
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be a time moving forward at a subsequent building committee meeting, which we're going to get into sort of the scrutinizing of the actual square footage itself.

789
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:43,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll talk about the gross square footage at that point in time.

790
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:47,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions?

791
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:48,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Aaron?

792
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a question about the parking garages.

793
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:56,284
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know that the idea right now is for 425, I think, spots or so.

794
01:10:56,644 --> 01:10:57,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And you said that that was the current

795
01:10:58,598 --> 01:11:00,179
[SPEAKER_15]: number or is that the projection number?

796
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:12,066
[SPEAKER_11]: The current number is around 425 dedicated spots, but there are about 476 spots if you include a lot of the extra spaces that are used on the side of the areas.

797
01:11:12,266 --> 01:11:12,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

798
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:28,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Then for the actual underground possibility, I know you mentioned you had a scale, so just having flats off like we currently have is usually on the cheaper end while building standard structure new, it's more expensive with the in-between option where we're building

799
01:11:28,865 --> 01:11:50,236
[SPEAKER_15]: under with a field on top like logistically speaking with like a track for example are there any major difficulties with that other than what we may assume that just come with like you know pre-planning that you know that may come up about like long-term success of it or you know like maintenance costs and things like that that might not exist with a more expensive original new construction or just what we have.

800
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:51,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are long questions.

801
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:57,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Short answer there are some construction logistic and long-term kind of

802
01:11:58,201 --> 01:12:13,269
[SPEAKER_11]: detailing logistics that would need to work through, things like expansion joints and where exactly those fall on your track and your field and whether you can accommodate structures like goalposts, things like that, with the underlying structure of the parking underneath.

803
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are design considerations that we're going to work through.

804
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:27,836
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, we believe that those solutions are feasible and worth costing for you all to make a decision about whether that's worth the cost to gain that added program space.

805
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:28,969
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of parking.

806
01:12:29,529 --> 01:12:29,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

807
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

808
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:49,654
[SPEAKER_05]: In the ad reno auctions, when the reno of whatever is left over happens, the school committee and hopefully this committee will agree that we want to leave Platinum.

809
01:12:50,514 --> 01:12:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?

810
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:57,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you convert any existing part of this building to leave Platinum?

811
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:05,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that literally even possible without taking all the walls out and pretending it's not?

812
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:13,091
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think with the renovation, I'm actually going to separate out the question into like, how do you deal with the existing building?

813
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:15,712
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the lead button question, because I think there's sort of a district.

814
01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:24,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Any of those renovations that we're looking at in that rental option is going to involve ripping this building apart down to the structure.

815
01:13:24,935 --> 01:13:26,355
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say that primarily because.

816
01:13:27,531 --> 01:13:31,352
[SPEAKER_17]: This building is not laterally supported to meet modern structural code.

817
01:13:31,832 --> 01:13:38,854
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to do things like adding in giant cross braces still cross spaces to help make the building laterally stable.

818
01:13:39,694 --> 01:13:43,676
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just can't do that with maintaining really any level of this.

819
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:52,438
[SPEAKER_17]: That being said also the like the interior spaces there's very few if any of the existing interior spaces that meet the spatial requirements.

820
01:13:52,478 --> 01:13:55,299
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's significant reconfiguration of the existing space.

821
01:13:55,904 --> 01:14:04,429
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't think anyone should be thinking that in any of those renovation option, it's like, we'll place the ceiling and paint the walls and the flooring, and then we're like good to go and we're done.

822
01:14:04,749 --> 01:14:05,910
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be significant.

823
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,971
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be invasive in terms of renovations.

824
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:14,575
[SPEAKER_17]: There's still value to that from a carbon management standpoint, right?

825
01:14:14,795 --> 01:14:18,757
[SPEAKER_17]: When all this concrete and steel was built back in 1970,

826
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:28,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Like there's a tremendous amount of energy that was put in, there was a tremendous amount of carbon that was expended to sort of build all those things, and we can still leverage all that in the building.

827
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:39,478
[SPEAKER_17]: That will contribute positively to the sustainability model of the building moving forward, but the LEED Platinum designation is going to be contingent on a whole host of other things.

828
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:44,746
[SPEAKER_17]: the exterior insulation of the building, the treatment that we take to the site as well.

829
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:47,988
[SPEAKER_17]: This is really like a holistic sustainability lens.

830
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:54,112
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, yes, it's going to definitely incorporate the renovated area and it will make that part of it a little bit easier.

831
01:14:55,053 --> 01:15:00,256
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's not to say that we can't do a LEED Platinum building with or without renovation.

832
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:04,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke?

833
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:06,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So any considerations?

834
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have sustainability goals.

835
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:13,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask what considerations were given to square footage dedicated to solar panels.

836
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:17,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the Arlington High School in Adelman.

837
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a larger enrollment than we do.

838
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:25,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their overall structure is 410,000 square feet.

839
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:38,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And they managed to get enough panels up there to, I think, produce close to 1,000 kilowatts or kilowatt hours, which represented

840
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:41,615
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe 30 to 40% of their electrical need.

841
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:46,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at all these different options, they vary in roof surface area.

842
01:15:46,836 --> 01:15:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you have a sense of, you know, for the smallest option that you showed, what the panel capacity would be?

843
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:58,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the largest, what it would be?

844
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:05,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other sort of places to put panels, I guess, to hit some of our sustainability goals.

845
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:27,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I think the way that we're trying to think about PV at the moment is through, again, that costing lens in terms of thinking about what it will take in terms of whether it's a net zero goal, whether it's a net positive goal, trying to target there in terms of the amount of square footage of panels that it would take to achieve that goal.

846
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:43,469
[SPEAKER_17]: And then either deploy them as roof-mounted PV panels or parking canopy-mounted panels as well, or even site-mounted in theory, if we could sort of find any area of the site where it doesn't want to be a field or parking or anything along those lines.

847
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:57,218
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's going to be one of those things where I think we're going to have cost alternatives as well, sort of a la carte items to say, if we wanted to try and just put enough PV that would fit on a roof, we'll have maybe three different sizes, like a small, medium, large volume of that.

848
01:16:58,385 --> 01:17:10,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And then associated with it, certain volumes areas of PV panels that would probably be canopy mounted over parking areas to produce like an overall capacity.

849
01:17:10,879 --> 01:17:16,926
[SPEAKER_17]: We are looking at sort of a very baseline UI understanding of what the building is going to be targeting.

850
01:17:16,946 --> 01:17:18,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So energy use intensity for the building.

851
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:26,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will tell us, okay, how much electricity generally is it going to be required for this amount of square footage?

852
01:17:26,111 --> 01:17:33,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Because again, we can make that very high level sort of calculation to see, but it is going to be contingent on roof areas.

853
01:17:33,456 --> 01:17:37,098
[SPEAKER_17]: These all, as you were saying, do have different roof areas associated with them.

854
01:17:37,518 --> 01:17:40,119
[SPEAKER_17]: The sprawling ones are going to have more, the taller ones will have less.

855
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:45,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to have to look at sort of generally how much roof area we have and how many panels

856
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:50,209
[SPEAKER_17]: we can fit on the roof and then on the parking canopies as a mix.

857
01:17:50,249 --> 01:18:07,199
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's probably not going to be like a clean one number for every single different option, but we're going to have sort of like an umbrella a la carte set of options that are dealing with PV panels and trying to, at the best level of our understanding right now, do some estimating to understand what the cost of those would be.

858
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,062
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll probably be able to say that some of them are not net zero.

859
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them are meeting net zero.

860
01:18:14,426 --> 01:18:16,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe some will be positive at the end of the day.

861
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that answer the question?

862
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hi.

863
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:23,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

864
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:28,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't see your face at all.

865
01:18:31,816 --> 01:18:35,978
[SPEAKER_16]: My question is on the next step, which is the costing stuff.

866
01:18:35,998 --> 01:18:37,900
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of options here.

867
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Have these been evaluated enough to confirm that they are feasible, or are we possibly

868
01:18:44,548 --> 01:18:52,252
[SPEAKER_16]: doing a cost estimate on something that turns out isn't even actually achievable, whether it's a phasing constraint or, you know, it sprawled out too much.

869
01:18:52,272 --> 01:18:54,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So just curious on that.

870
01:18:56,133 --> 01:19:01,516
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think the phasing would be the only thing that would maybe drive feasibility one way or the other.

871
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:05,572
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know that we would say right now that it's not feasible.

872
01:19:05,632 --> 01:19:22,480
[SPEAKER_17]: What may happen is that we just have to think about it being too many phases, right, in terms of just moving slowly in sort of smallish areas where it's not going to be desirable from an overall building committee perspective and community perspective in terms of getting the project done.

873
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's mainly where that's going to come in.

874
01:19:27,019 --> 01:19:28,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we'll know that upfront.

875
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:38,030
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tough to go into it and just say, you know, right away, like every one of these options, exactly where it's going to be, but we'll make our best judgment in terms of how we could possibly do this.

876
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,912
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll feed that through the cost estimator.

877
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:40,693
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get feedback.

878
01:19:40,733 --> 01:19:47,700
[SPEAKER_17]: And that may be one of the drivers on the cost side of things or the time side of things that says, we're just going to put that aside.

879
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,463
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not going to actually move that forward in terms of consideration.

880
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:59,938
[SPEAKER_16]: But what if you came across something that did become, you know, as you're going through, you're going to be that they're going to have, they're going to need that, or they estimate it, right?

881
01:19:59,998 --> 01:20:09,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you maybe knock one of these out as you're further evaluating the, you know, the... If we found a deal breaker, I think, yes, we wouldn't want to do it without the input from this group.

882
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,612
[SPEAKER_17]: So as we're doing, as we're preparing

883
01:20:12,286 --> 01:20:16,267
[SPEAKER_17]: the information that's going to get to the cost estimators, which is going to happen next week.

884
01:20:16,587 --> 01:20:21,349
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's something that comes up to that process that we see, it doesn't seem like it's viable at all.

885
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:26,430
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd probably come back at the next building committee meeting and just explain that as part of the process.

886
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,830
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a fair point.

887
01:20:28,511 --> 01:20:29,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just want to add to that.

888
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:40,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the site explorations, a lot of them are well underway, but a big one that is not complete yet is the geotechnical, which will inform foundation design.

889
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:47,797
[SPEAKER_10]: also say everything is feasible, it's just a matter of practicality and cost at a certain moment.

890
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:56,442
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that will certainly be a big factor that will potentially influence what makes sense, but that is still underway.

891
01:20:56,462 --> 01:21:08,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, again, that's what I was thinking, maybe taking it further and understanding practicality of each of these alternatives before getting a cost estimator, but maybe we need it because there's a deliverable that needs to be submitted or something.

892
01:21:08,389 --> 01:21:08,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Bingo.

893
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:09,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that is correct.

894
01:21:10,618 --> 01:21:18,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and this is so early and remember we're not, you all don't choose an option until the end of PSR, so in June.

895
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:22,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

896
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:26,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question about parking again.

897
01:21:26,306 --> 01:21:36,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happened to notice by like zooming in that although all the program spaces are volumetric, that some of them have a parking area that

898
01:21:42,082 --> 01:21:46,746
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm really trying not to envision buildings that are not at that point yet.

899
01:21:48,867 --> 01:22:02,158
[SPEAKER_15]: But if any of these plans would force a multi-story parking garage, I think that would be very, I would really like to know what that would do for a whole host of reasons.

900
01:22:02,738 --> 01:22:05,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it's appropriate.

901
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:11,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to necessarily go back through all of these now, but if any of these decisions come to a forcing point,

902
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:13,648
[SPEAKER_02]: where that's the only way to achieve that.

903
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:19,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see and let everyone see the true voluntary work that we're doing.

904
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:24,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you talk a little bit about the criteria work we're going to do in March?

905
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:28,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think to your point, we will all have criteria.

906
01:22:29,052 --> 01:22:36,894
[SPEAKER_12]: And once we get through PVP, there will be a whole exercise for us to go through around decision criteria.

907
01:22:36,914 --> 01:22:39,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So can you just explain that process a little bit for us?

908
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:44,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, for those of you that love Excel spreadsheets and charts and graphs, that's something that we're going to be creating.

909
01:22:44,922 --> 01:22:50,787
[SPEAKER_17]: So essentially what we need is a rubric, right, to be able to create a lens to look at and evaluate all these options.

910
01:22:50,847 --> 01:22:53,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Cost is obviously a huge driver, right, but it's not the only driver.

911
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:59,875
[SPEAKER_17]: There's community perspectives that need to be brought, there's educational perspectives that need to be brought in.

912
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:07,720
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we're actually going to do is first design the tool, the lens, the rubric that we're going to be using to evaluate things.

913
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,003
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's going to sort of list all of the options across the top.

914
01:23:11,824 --> 01:23:13,666
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have cost at that point to do that with.

915
01:23:14,126 --> 01:23:16,268
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're going to list all the qualitative pieces.

916
01:23:16,348 --> 01:23:26,237
[SPEAKER_17]: And so parking garage and sort of the viability of a parking garage, the desirability of a parking garage, that may be in the column as we go down in terms of site considerations as we do.

917
01:23:27,154 --> 01:23:31,077
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone's going to have different thoughts about sort of what should be driving.

918
01:23:31,117 --> 01:23:44,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we want to do is sort of take a consensus understanding from the committee, from everyone's particular areas of concern and areas of expertise, and develop something that is really a great lens for the Medford community to evaluate all these different options on.

919
01:23:45,028 --> 01:23:49,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Cost, again, just being one, an important one, but lots of other things are going to plug in there.

920
01:23:49,999 --> 01:24:06,948
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some great examples from other projects that maybe have even too many considerations in them, and it may be sort of just a calling process to get down there, but there may be others that are very specific to the Medford community that we want to put in there, like the pool building and sort of the considerations that are associated with that.

921
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:12,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So that will be coming, I think, is that our next building committee meeting that we're going to actually be doing that?

922
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:13,551
[SPEAKER_17]: No, in March.

923
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:15,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so two ahead.

924
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:17,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

925
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:19,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Aaron?

926
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:23,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Designs of where the pool building or the gymnasium are separated.

927
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:28,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any consideration about having this topic, what I said.

928
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:28,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Designs.

929
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Designs.

930
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Designs, sorry.

931
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:31,881
[SPEAKER_15]: For models.

932
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:32,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

933
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:38,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any, was there consideration about having cover ways for students to be walking to just think with the weather and things like that.

934
01:24:38,102 --> 01:24:42,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of students probably might not want to be walking in the four weather that's happening.

935
01:24:42,263 --> 01:24:42,883
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to know.

936
01:24:44,134 --> 01:24:45,235
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that would make sense.

937
01:24:45,575 --> 01:24:50,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's certainly something that we could get cost modeling for in terms of something that runs along.

938
01:24:51,299 --> 01:24:53,380
[SPEAKER_17]: One of them that was shown, again, not designs.

939
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

940
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:57,503
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but it goes down that path pretty quickly.

941
01:24:58,104 --> 01:25:07,550
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's a plinth of single deck parking and there's a field, you could also imagine that there could be an area of that that you could walk sort of below the field from one building to the next.

942
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:09,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a couple of different ways to go at it.

943
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:10,212
[SPEAKER_17]: I think right now,

944
01:25:10,665 --> 01:25:15,188
[SPEAKER_17]: what we want to do is just make sure that we have like a cost placeholder there to anticipate something like that.

945
01:25:15,849 --> 01:25:24,815
[SPEAKER_17]: So we may just get some cost for some additional structure on top of the parking, not to just over inflate that, but to try and address those types of observations.

946
01:25:24,835 --> 01:25:27,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you have a question?

947
01:25:27,837 --> 01:25:27,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

948
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:28,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Maria?

949
01:25:28,338 --> 01:25:31,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I didn't see you over there.

950
01:25:38,788 --> 01:25:45,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember at what point it was discussed, but we did talk about the potential for the fells around us.

951
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:49,393
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like everything is staying within the current borders.

952
01:25:50,574 --> 01:25:56,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any conversation or possibility of extending out into the fells with any of these designs?

953
01:25:57,297 --> 01:25:58,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see.

954
01:25:59,318 --> 01:26:01,999
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's no, it's a great point.

955
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:06,942
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no options that show extension beyond the property lines that were

956
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:08,663
[SPEAKER_17]: constrained within right now.

957
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:16,267
[SPEAKER_17]: We have been having advisory team meetings and one of them was site safety and security, the second of which happened actually last night.

958
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:24,691
[SPEAKER_17]: And we talked a little bit about like the Mustang loop and sort of how that was created, but also the fact that it's not Denver's property, right?

959
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:25,832
[SPEAKER_17]: It's DCR property.

960
01:26:26,632 --> 01:26:32,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there's some discussions that have to happen with any of those neighbors, whether it's a DCR or anyone else,

961
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:37,271
[SPEAKER_17]: before we would show anything or propose anything going on anyone else's property.

962
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:39,352
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now we're not holding those costs.

963
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:57,499
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something that we can decide as a committee though, as to whether or not there's things that we want to account for in terms of pricing, not because we think we can do that yet, but just because we want to have a cost understanding of what it might be to, I don't know, put another, like a boardwalk along the entirety of the Mustang loop or something to improve the accessibility of it.

964
01:26:57,519 --> 01:27:00,940
[SPEAKER_17]: And just, that's an example that sort of came out of the discussions last night.

965
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,101
[SPEAKER_17]: So those may be some things that

966
01:27:03,508 --> 01:27:04,368
[SPEAKER_17]: that we want to look at.

967
01:27:04,388 --> 01:27:09,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Several of the options do look at locating the trailheads in slightly new locations.

968
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:23,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just a slight shift of where those trails are welcomed into the property or are accessed from the property so that there can be just a better link between parking and school gathering spaces and trailheads.

969
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,613
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's at an early stage.

970
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:32,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we'll be looking for you all to guide us on how much of that gets included in the design phases.

971
01:27:33,344 --> 01:27:34,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'd have to have those conversations.

972
01:27:35,325 --> 01:27:40,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just reiterate that again, that it's not something that we can decide and do of our own.

973
01:27:45,329 --> 01:27:54,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was a little disappointed in seeing a lot of concepts that tried to utilize the athletic fields.

974
01:27:56,274 --> 01:28:00,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And the athletic fields are highly utilized by communities.

975
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:05,189
[SPEAKER_03]: The school sports teams, there are the town recreational leagues.

976
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a number of club teams.

977
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, every weekend I actually run to my house, uh, for the high school.

978
01:28:14,353 --> 01:28:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm up here pretty frequently, but I have a pretty good sense of how highly utilized these fields are.

979
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:27,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I was disappointed in, but I also sort of acknowledge, uh, that it's a nice flat area to work on.

980
01:28:27,838 --> 01:28:28,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

981
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:28,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's appealing.

982
01:28:29,918 --> 01:28:31,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be very disruptive.

983
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:46,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So my disappointment comes from seeing more concepts that utilize that space versus, say, what you marked as site two, which is a football practice field and a hill and parking lot.

984
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:58,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted to ask, is there like a limiting factor or something that just makes that property undesirable?

985
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:05,207
[SPEAKER_03]: a board, or was it just an arbitrary choice because the fields in the back are nice and flat?

986
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:22,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we, I mean, for a cost standpoint, the two options we show on site two, the matter of what arrangement of that square footage should cover that kind of project there.

987
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are like more variations when we're getting to design.

988
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:40,157
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, site two is, you know, coming out ahead, you know, we'll certainly need to investigate all the possibilities there, but from a cost standpoint, you know, two options we show, let's show the square footage.

989
01:29:40,177 --> 01:29:52,644
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of them do reach back, so perhaps there's another one we could develop, perhaps, that locates more of the square footage and preserves both of the fields up there.

990
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:00,482
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't think there was any indication of preference by quantity, like those two things are not correlated here.

991
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:04,464
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the fact that we're just looking for discrete cost models, right?

992
01:30:04,504 --> 01:30:10,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I think as Michael said, we have between those two, like a little one, one that's a little bit taller, one that's a little bit wider.

993
01:30:10,527 --> 01:30:14,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Those will sort of add to those two variables that would impact site two.

994
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:21,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And then beyond that, we're just looking for different combinations on the higher site, on the parking lot down below.

995
01:30:22,293 --> 01:30:23,753
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's really no preference in R&D.

996
01:30:23,773 --> 01:30:26,834
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great to hear that you have a strong preference against that.

997
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:32,295
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's sort of what we're hearing, we'd like to hear from everybody if there's considerations about building here and there.

998
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:34,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a conversation, right?

999
01:30:34,956 --> 01:30:39,957
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not something that any one of us can probably decide, even at this point.

1000
01:30:42,197 --> 01:30:43,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just clarify for me.

1001
01:30:43,658 --> 01:30:46,398
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's your concern that during construction, there would be disruption.

1002
01:30:46,418 --> 01:30:49,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume the field would be replicated in the end.

1003
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:50,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we would be losing them just

1004
01:30:51,026 --> 01:30:54,587
[SPEAKER_14]: temporary shuttles, is that what you're saying?

1005
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.

1006
01:30:55,787 --> 01:30:59,588
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a period of time that they would be unusable during construction.

1007
01:30:59,948 --> 01:31:06,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if they're being relocated, they'll be unusable, or their equipment won't be unusable until that's included.

1008
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am working with a finite timeline.

1009
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:20,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also working with real timelines for kids that are attending high school today, or that are entering high school in the next, say, three years.

1010
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:24,684
[SPEAKER_03]: that will have a big impact on their athletic lives.

1011
01:31:25,264 --> 01:31:34,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll have a very large effect on the travel leagues that utilize it or leagues that utilize it.

1012
01:31:35,171 --> 01:31:37,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to touch thousands of people.

1013
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:39,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul?

1014
01:31:40,374 --> 01:31:48,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is a really important conversation for the whole community to have, because one of the things I struggle with is

1015
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:51,936
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, construction is what, three, four years?

1016
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:54,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it two years?

1017
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:57,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Three years.

1018
01:31:57,597 --> 01:31:58,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Schedule is important.

1019
01:31:58,698 --> 01:32:06,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've been on record saying that the target opening date for the school is in the fall of 2030, right?

1020
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,401
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's some aggressiveness to that timeline.

1021
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:15,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're not going to throw out dates or options right now that are going to exceed that.

1022
01:32:15,996 --> 01:32:24,839
[SPEAKER_17]: that will be one sort of valuation criteria as we put together this matrix to say if we can't get it open by fall 2030, what does that mean for the option, right?

1023
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:37,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And we may not know that 100% until we get a construction manager on board that can tell us with a very fine level of detail exactly what, but we're going to get in the right ballpark and we're going to know it's feasible based on sort of what the industry tells us.

1024
01:32:38,585 --> 01:32:45,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I struggle with is this, and I don't have any answer of my own at this point,

1025
01:32:45,847 --> 01:32:58,931
[SPEAKER_05]: is how much do we essentially take away from three years of students so that 40, 50, 60 years of students can have a better option?

1026
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's really part of the conversation we talk about.

1027
01:33:03,473 --> 01:33:08,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We might like this option way more, but it's going to make life really bad for those kids in three years.

1028
01:33:09,935 --> 01:33:10,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think

1029
01:33:16,108 --> 01:33:20,569
[SPEAKER_05]: The community's loss of the fields, to me, is not even in the column.

1030
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:24,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it runs somewhere else.

1031
01:33:25,551 --> 01:33:30,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But the students that are going to be here for those three years are my concern.

1032
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:36,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, my bigger concern, frankly, is the next 40, 50 years of students.

1033
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:40,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So how bad are the students?

1034
01:33:40,696 --> 01:33:41,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Just how bad?

1035
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:46,357
[SPEAKER_05]: before I feel like there's a breaking point.

1036
01:33:46,657 --> 01:33:54,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, maybe the next several generations don't get what we really wish they could get, because it's just too bad.

1037
01:33:55,061 --> 01:34:02,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually went to school in some of those temporary, whatever the classroom, they were the best classroom in the building.

1038
01:34:02,964 --> 01:34:04,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't fighting all of them.

1039
01:34:04,385 --> 01:34:08,567
[SPEAKER_05]: They had work from heat, work from air conditioning.

1040
01:34:09,087 --> 01:34:11,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think in our minds,

1041
01:34:12,032 --> 01:34:13,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They're oral, but if you've walked around here.

1042
01:34:13,933 --> 01:34:16,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Or if you're currently sharing.

1043
01:34:16,635 --> 01:34:19,017
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter goes to one class, she's freezing.

1044
01:34:19,037 --> 01:34:21,898
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes to the next class, she wishes she could wear a bikini.

1045
01:34:22,419 --> 01:34:28,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what temperature it's at.

1046
01:34:28,883 --> 01:34:35,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think as a committee, we kind of have to at some point, and not just tonight, today, we have to really think about that.

1047
01:34:38,249 --> 01:34:41,291
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably going to have options that we agree are

1048
01:34:41,712 --> 01:34:45,193
[SPEAKER_05]: better options that are going to make it harder for those three years.

1049
01:34:48,134 --> 01:34:50,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hard conversation.

1050
01:34:52,255 --> 01:34:54,275
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to pause.

1051
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:56,116
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 8.07.

1052
01:34:56,236 --> 01:35:01,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know if any of our community members had questions or comments that they'd like to provide.

1053
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you could just say your name and your address for the record.

1054
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:06,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Osborne.

1055
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on First Street.

1056
01:35:10,777 --> 01:35:35,931
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I was wondering, I guess one of my questions or design consideration, have you, given that this has been being serviced for 40, 50 years, are you adding the option, except we're using that word a lot, the ability to easily expand if we find a size

1057
01:35:40,888 --> 01:35:43,509
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you think that you need child support?

1058
01:35:43,889 --> 01:35:44,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1059
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:52,133
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are required through the MFBA program to plan for a certain amount of physical expansion on the site.

1060
01:35:52,273 --> 01:35:54,514
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will be part of the considerations as we move forward.

1061
01:35:54,895 --> 01:36:01,598
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't necessarily cooked that into every one of these 29 options just yet, because it's just, again, a little bit too much in terms of bringing that in.

1062
01:36:01,618 --> 01:36:04,919
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's the physical expansion that we have in California.

1063
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I forget, Matt, exactly what the percentage.

1064
01:36:09,622 --> 01:36:10,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a percentage.

1065
01:36:11,437 --> 01:36:16,620
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of the enrollment so it's either 10 or 20% increased enrollment is sort of what the MSB prescribes.

1066
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:23,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Doesn't mean that we can't plan for more but again it will impact sort of the overall planning but the other site components depending on it.

1067
01:36:23,843 --> 01:36:30,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes we plan to go up and there's ways of designing the building to allow for future vertical expansion as an option.

1068
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:39,890
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing in terms of capacity on enrollment is just to note that we designed the school for an 85% utilization of the spaces.

1069
01:36:40,697 --> 01:36:47,361
[SPEAKER_17]: You can operate a high school at a slightly higher efficiency, say like 90, 92%.

1070
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:59,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you get above that, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to actually schedule classes and make sure that students can get the electives and the courses that they need to to meet their graduation requirements.

1071
01:36:59,269 --> 01:37:07,474
[SPEAKER_17]: But with that increased efficiency, you can get additional students into the same amount of space

1072
01:37:08,402 --> 01:37:13,685
[SPEAKER_17]: We also designed classrooms for 23 students which is during the MSBA policy.

1073
01:37:14,405 --> 01:37:19,188
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the day you may be able to fit additional students into a class.

1074
01:37:19,528 --> 01:37:34,937
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of things tied to that in terms of class policy school policy district policy teacher contracts a whole bunch of things that sort of quite but there's various areas that will allow for some additional growth in terms of enrollment.

1075
01:37:36,161 --> 01:37:44,564
[SPEAKER_17]: in addition to our planning for physical expansion beyond that.

1076
01:37:44,605 --> 01:37:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two somewhat related questions.

1077
01:37:47,506 --> 01:37:51,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first one is, there are some designs in particular on the new buildings.

1078
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:54,128
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like a four-story one and a six-story one.

1079
01:37:54,989 --> 01:38:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: The six-story one, obviously, more compact, takes a lot of extra space outside of the building.

1080
01:38:03,394 --> 01:38:13,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Given that the network footage of both options is the same, what is the plan to do with the extra space of the six-story building that's going to be built outside of the school?

1081
01:38:14,497 --> 01:38:21,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there might be maybe an opportunity to get some revenue out of that to fund the extra cost of the exerted floors.

1082
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Might give you more flexibility with expansion.

1083
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the second sort of somewhat related question is that, so our city is going through a zoning overhaul right now.

1084
01:38:33,732 --> 01:38:36,975
[SPEAKER_07]: that is going to increase density substantially in some areas of the city.

1085
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:59,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that the estimate for the school went from 1,200 to 1,395, but I wanted to know whether you could inculcate the extra density that very likely will come up to the city in that 1,395 number, and also whether the zoning overhauls would be used to consider

1086
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:09,143
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in a better fashion, the designs that are higher and leaving more space for 3D expansion.

1087
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:12,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want me to answer that, Matt?

1088
01:39:12,865 --> 01:39:14,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the question.

1089
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:24,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So when the MSBA did the initial enrollment study, they certified, they tried to certify our enrollment at 1200, which is about what happens today.

1090
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:31,113
[SPEAKER_12]: So their 15 year look forward, knowing about permitted projects,

1091
01:39:31,489 --> 01:39:42,577
[SPEAKER_12]: The MBTA Communities Act and a variety of things that we provided still held us very flat in terms of what the enrollment would be here at high school.

1092
01:39:43,157 --> 01:39:53,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's because the vast majority of the kinds of development that come out of the MBTA Communities Act, rezoning, upselling, all those things don't actually net additional students.

1093
01:39:54,165 --> 01:39:56,727
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the sort of history in Massachusetts.

1094
01:39:57,207 --> 01:40:00,990
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the Globe just published an article on Sunday talking about

1095
01:40:01,979 --> 01:40:08,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Student enrollment overall declining in Massachusetts and not rebounding really in any sort of way.

1096
01:40:08,905 --> 01:40:12,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, we have rebounded since COVID by and large.

1097
01:40:12,588 --> 01:40:16,371
[SPEAKER_12]: We went back to them because we said, well, wait a minute.

1098
01:40:17,372 --> 01:40:28,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Our analysis, if you start to look at some of the increased growth that we're seeing at the elementary levels, if you bring that out past 15 years, that's where you see this expansion.

1099
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:38,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also worked with them to say some of our development that we know is coming is such that it would actually bring more students.

1100
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:46,792
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're talking about affordable housing with multiple bedrooms, those are places where you can actually see increased enrollment.

1101
01:40:46,812 --> 01:40:52,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had to provide them comparable spaces in Medford to use for those estimated purposes.

1102
01:40:52,737 --> 01:40:53,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how we went from 1,200 to 1,395.

1103
01:40:57,692 --> 01:41:00,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Donating doesn't actually build anything, right?

1104
01:41:00,194 --> 01:41:01,375
[SPEAKER_12]: It just makes it possible.

1105
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:05,417
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's somewhat impossible to say yes, it did or no, it didn't.

1106
01:41:05,918 --> 01:41:15,825
[SPEAKER_12]: But there was like a lot of thoughtful work by their planning and development department, as well as our schools, our school budget director, to look at the history.

1107
01:41:16,425 --> 01:41:21,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And we looked out like 30 years, and we're still are not.

1108
01:41:22,049 --> 01:41:25,671
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just about getting better, sometimes about 30 years out.

1109
01:41:26,974 --> 01:41:30,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that like the perfect answer or is it like perfectly scientific?

1110
01:41:30,436 --> 01:41:34,399
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but that is some of the work that we have already been doing.

1111
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:42,545
[SPEAKER_12]: And to your point, we'll invite the council to the school committee meeting so they can hear an update and learn about the educational plan.

1112
01:41:42,565 --> 01:41:51,751
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll be asking them to sort of engage with us and all of you as we have this conversation, because obviously there is a tie, right?

1113
01:41:52,192 --> 01:41:55,414
[SPEAKER_12]: If we start building skyscrapers of affordable housings,

1114
01:41:55,959 --> 01:42:00,102
[SPEAKER_12]: we will have increased enrollment that is beyond what we're expecting.

1115
01:42:00,122 --> 01:42:14,454
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think I've heard anything in the zoning conversation, although I know it's very much still in progress, that says to me that there's something way out of alignment, but that process is so far from done that we don't know yet.

1116
01:42:15,074 --> 01:42:21,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But just to give you a couple of for instances, the data that we use with MSPA included

1117
01:42:22,405 --> 01:42:24,787
[SPEAKER_12]: a significant air rights project over Wellington.

1118
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:29,811
[SPEAKER_12]: It also included Medford Square redevelopment, I think like 100 units.

1119
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:35,015
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was a whole bunch of pretty big developments, like big new developments that were considered.

1120
01:42:36,036 --> 01:42:46,605
[SPEAKER_12]: On the project website, there is a PowerPoint that talks about enrollment and how we like went through that process with the NSBA that you might find interesting or useful.

1121
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:50,688
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually showing the primitive projects and the ones we use as pumps and all that stuff.

1122
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:55,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes and no is the answer.

1123
01:42:55,913 --> 01:42:56,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Rick?

1124
01:42:56,713 --> 01:42:58,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Rick Orlando.

1125
01:42:58,395 --> 01:42:59,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for the mic.

1126
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:17,449
[SPEAKER_03]: My original question, and then a second one related to the expansion, but if any of the selected design requires a movement of the athletic fields to some post bottom site, is the SBAB going to fund that kind of movement or use new athletic field?

1127
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1128
01:43:20,328 --> 01:43:35,821
[SPEAKER_03]: With all the discussion on the lower grade levels of the middle schools, could there be any possibility of, if not building it, but allowing the expansion capability for yet another middle school somewhere up on the site down the road?

1129
01:43:36,522 --> 01:43:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a long range option.

1130
01:43:39,925 --> 01:43:44,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The middle schools are being squeezed, as you know, in terms of enrollment coming up to the element.

1131
01:43:45,249 --> 01:43:48,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so one of the things that we

1132
01:43:48,988 --> 01:44:05,056
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of talked briefly about pre-K here tonight, but that whole location of pre-K is good for students for a lot of reasons, because it allows us to centralize services and provide more access to services than what we're able to do with those preschool programs sort of all over the district.

1133
01:44:06,697 --> 01:44:12,379
[SPEAKER_12]: It also allows us some capacity that we don't have today, because preschool is a crying need in the district.

1134
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:17,482
[SPEAKER_12]: And it pulls classrooms out of the elementary schools to create space there.

1135
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:25,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of this, and I can't quantify it, but part of the vision here is by doing that, we're also creating space in our own new school.

1136
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:32,421
[SPEAKER_12]: To your point, the question then becomes, if you needed capacity at the middle school, what would you do?

1137
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:45,132
[SPEAKER_12]: We certainly could look at whether there, like the expansion options here could certainly include grade reconfiguration, but where the two middle schools are currently located also is a pretty substantial site.

1138
01:44:45,932 --> 01:44:52,415
[SPEAKER_12]: And that could potentially be a project down the road if necessary.

1139
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1140
01:44:55,457 --> 01:45:00,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we're thinking that that is like limited or new.

1141
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Like my personal goal is that we do this one project and we're good.

1142
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:04,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1143
01:45:04,582 --> 01:45:05,802
[SPEAKER_12]: For a long time.

1144
01:45:06,703 --> 01:45:13,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, how, whether we are able to achieve that or not, it depends on a lot of things, but

1145
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:18,229
[SPEAKER_12]: the expansion here would not be necessarily one way or the other.

1146
01:45:18,769 --> 01:45:19,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1147
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,431
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to put Matt on the spot actually.

1148
01:45:22,531 --> 01:45:28,614
[SPEAKER_17]: You had a nice entry there to talk a little bit about reimbursement of site work and how the MSBA views that.

1149
01:45:28,634 --> 01:45:30,255
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would just be helpful.

1150
01:45:30,315 --> 01:45:38,199
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a little while to wrap our minds around what it is, but to just give a quick overview of that and then we can maybe answer some other questions.

1151
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:49,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, and this is going to be a larger presentation that we'll be having as we start to get through some of these options and head into the next phase, the preferred schematic report.

1152
01:45:49,415 --> 01:45:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: But the MSBA has a series of guidelines and cost caps throughout the grant program.

1153
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is the site cap.

1154
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:04,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, they will reimburse for site work and fields, but it is also capped.

1155
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:05,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you meet a certain

1156
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:10,265
[SPEAKER_04]: funding limit, everything above that is considered not reimbursable.

1157
01:46:10,385 --> 01:46:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a yes and a no.

1158
01:46:13,288 --> 01:46:22,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be up to this committee to really kind of decide, you know, weigh those, you know, pros and cons of going above MSBA reimbursement or not.

1159
01:46:22,156 --> 01:46:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1160
01:46:30,328 --> 01:46:34,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to a new school, renovated school, whatever it turns out to be.

1161
01:46:34,769 --> 01:46:46,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say living in the neighborhood or finding the high school and following the project of the six or nine homes that we built, you may want to consider as part of your geotechnical work, right?

1162
01:46:46,992 --> 01:46:52,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a worldly estimate, but I think there's a lot of topography back there, especially in the third site.

1163
01:46:52,654 --> 01:46:54,914
[SPEAKER_03]: That certainly would be a deal breaker right out in the gate.

1164
01:46:55,154 --> 01:46:57,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hate to see us spending extra money

1165
01:46:58,165 --> 01:47:01,588
[SPEAKER_03]: process to make it more designed for that matter.

1166
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:08,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't caution you to be a driver, but it is.

1167
01:47:10,156 --> 01:47:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Another question, I did recognize in the proximity of the Temple of Shalom and their kind of collaboration with the city, are we exploring any options to enhance that kind of gateway?

1168
01:47:24,567 --> 01:47:28,249
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities to maybe share parking, other arrangements.

1169
01:47:28,389 --> 01:47:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Living in a great neighborhood, that means there's a lot of opportunities for us.

1170
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:37,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to answer the temple question?

1171
01:47:37,775 --> 01:47:38,696
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you want to answer?

1172
01:47:38,736 --> 01:47:42,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you answer the temple question and I'll answer the rock question.

1173
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:47,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, we have been in touch with the temple.

1174
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:53,625
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you both know, as you know, because you're in a butter,

1175
01:47:54,432 --> 01:48:02,217
[SPEAKER_12]: the survey work sort of extended sort of beyond, I think, even where I was personally surprised to see it extend as far as it was.

1176
01:48:02,317 --> 01:48:04,098
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of that is because it doesn't about fell.

1177
01:48:04,118 --> 01:48:07,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So now you have to tie into the things that are a little bit further away.

1178
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:15,065
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been in touch with them during the process of all the survey work that's been going on.

1179
01:48:15,085 --> 01:48:16,105
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're very aware.

1180
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:22,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually talked to Rabbi Jessica last week or so and did sort of highlight for her that

1181
01:48:22,805 --> 01:48:30,911
[SPEAKER_12]: This project obviously has potential to impact them in a whole variety of ways, not just construction.

1182
01:48:31,232 --> 01:48:50,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the same way that I have my eye on the skate park that is not ours, and that's PCR land, there's all kinds of things that surround us that once the surveying is complete, we probably do have conversations to have and to collaborate with the temple to say,

1183
01:48:51,975 --> 01:48:57,038
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, what is possible, like, you know, we talk about, like, emergency access and all those things.

1184
01:48:57,118 --> 01:49:00,901
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've had some very, very preliminary conversations.

1185
01:49:01,661 --> 01:49:09,566
[SPEAKER_12]: She did note that they enjoy being able to listen to the marching band when the marching band is practicing.

1186
01:49:09,726 --> 01:49:18,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yes, there are benefits in both directions, and hopefully we'll be able to have some more of those conversations as we get into this next, like, three, four-month phase.

1187
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and one other question.

1188
01:49:21,431 --> 01:49:25,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm raising a concern about LEED Platinum.

1189
01:49:25,413 --> 01:49:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I question if this is just a rolling on LEED Platinum or whether there's a specialized entity that's in place that gets us to an energy-compliant, say, model that we want to be at.

1190
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:45,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Sustainability and the site design, I'm sure SMA will develop a beautiful site for walkability, connectivity.

1191
01:49:46,775 --> 01:49:51,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wouldn't let it be platinum if we're trying to get an energy goal.

1192
01:49:51,598 --> 01:49:56,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a specialized energy goal is going to get us pretty much that frontal.

1193
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:58,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be interested about the rocks.

1194
01:49:58,382 --> 01:50:06,827
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll just say we're acutely aware of the geology of this particular site.

1195
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:14,972
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that adjacent site where the residential development is going on is definitely like a case study to be observed and precedent to be understood.

1196
01:50:16,687 --> 01:50:21,971
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have borings, geotechnical borings, that are happening at Edgeley Field as well as at the practice field.

1197
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:23,632
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to understand what's there.

1198
01:50:24,093 --> 01:50:31,718
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also doing, and Laura will probably give me the better term for it here in terms of what is the geophysical.

1199
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:39,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Essentially what we're going to get from our geotechnical engineer is a topographic model of the rock below the surface.

1200
01:50:39,664 --> 01:50:42,126
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the best they can approximate it without digging it all up.

1201
01:50:42,865 --> 01:50:51,209
[SPEAKER_17]: That will allow us to even think about whether we're positioning a building to try and mitigate or take advantage of rock removal if we have to do that.

1202
01:50:52,009 --> 01:50:54,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were also the designers for the Waltham High School.

1203
01:50:54,510 --> 01:51:00,513
[SPEAKER_17]: And as part of that project, we removed a ridiculous amount of stone as part of it.

1204
01:51:00,953 --> 01:51:02,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a couple of considerations.

1205
01:51:02,814 --> 01:51:04,055
[SPEAKER_17]: One is schedule, right?

1206
01:51:04,095 --> 01:51:09,397
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of, we've spent almost nine months there just removing rock before we got to actually build a building.

1207
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:20,574
[SPEAKER_17]: The economics of it are interesting, though, because with rock removal at that scale and volume, the subcontractors that are doing it can actually sell that rock out to gravel and other projects.

1208
01:51:20,614 --> 01:51:26,259
[SPEAKER_17]: We had gravel show up from Waltham High School at our Andover Elementary School as material.

1209
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:28,261
[SPEAKER_17]: We got submittals for it, and this was the source for it.

1210
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:30,723
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's definitely a cost.

1211
01:51:30,763 --> 01:51:34,926
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a cost premium to take that approach, whether or not it completely invalidates

1212
01:51:36,317 --> 01:51:38,017
[SPEAKER_17]: what something is being unfeasible.

1213
01:51:38,077 --> 01:51:38,937
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know that yet.

1214
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:43,758
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we just have to get through our studies to have a better understanding of it.

1215
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,999
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll go through all those various thought processes with everybody here.

1216
01:51:50,879 --> 01:51:51,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1217
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Not everyone's able to stand up.

1218
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So last question for you.

1219
01:51:56,821 --> 01:52:05,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Any project like this, especially when you've got all these alternatives, as you move towards selection, there's going to be criteria that you're all going to look at.

1220
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:21,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And my approach for the program is select those criteria beforehand, whether it's, you know, a couple I mentioned, obviously, cost, meeting the educational needs, instruction timing, length.

1221
01:52:21,954 --> 01:52:26,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding those before you get to the heat of the battle.

1222
01:52:27,036 --> 01:52:33,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Document them, spell them out so it's clear on what they are, are there rating factors, things like that.

1223
01:52:35,267 --> 01:52:39,768
[SPEAKER_03]: looking into the heat of the discussion, everybody's working their favorite factor.

1224
01:52:39,808 --> 01:52:41,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to have an objective discussion.

1225
01:52:42,909 --> 01:52:43,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1226
01:52:47,171 --> 01:52:50,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see any hands on Zoom.

1227
01:52:50,712 --> 01:52:54,353
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did want everyone to be able to get up and move around for a couple of minutes.

1228
01:52:55,553 --> 01:53:00,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And the team did bring some like bigger versions of what you see here.

1229
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:06,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we can bring them into the middle and let everybody get up and move around for 10 minutes and look at them.

1230
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:08,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And Helen has little stickers for us.

1231
01:53:09,961 --> 01:53:13,824
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're here, you get to use stickers.

1232
01:53:13,964 --> 01:53:20,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you're online, you can continue to use the Mentimeter to tell us your thumbs ups and your thumbs downs.

1233
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1234
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:22,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Just really quick with the stickers.

1235
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:30,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we're going to give everybody six stickers so that you can put those down on areas where you actually have a preference for.

1236
01:53:30,487 --> 01:53:39,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Some, again, not design options, cost alternatives, but it's just a way of us generating sort of a heat map of interest on particular areas as we move forward.

1237
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:47,355
[SPEAKER_17]: We're still going to be considering all of them as we go, unless, again, anyone voices an opinion that, and then their consensus that, no, we want to take that away.

1238
01:53:48,035 --> 01:53:56,719
[SPEAKER_17]: But I didn't hear any of that necessarily as we were going through the conversation, but that's the goal of this sort of sticker and you can get up and walk around activation.

1239
01:53:57,197 --> 01:54:01,399
[SPEAKER_17]: But the stickers on black and the stickers on things like you'll have different colors.

1240
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:03,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't have like one color for everything.

1241
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:07,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're a little bit regular And then for those of you are like 10 or so minutes and we'll be back.

1242
02:09:29,038 --> 02:09:30,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they hear us again on Zoom, Will?

1243
02:09:31,479 --> 02:09:33,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're on mute.

1244
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:34,520
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

1245
02:09:35,981 --> 02:09:39,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, everyone, for your input.

1246
02:09:39,102 --> 02:09:44,064
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take a picture and post it online somewhere so we can see what was happening here in the room.

1247
02:09:46,686 --> 02:09:54,729
[SPEAKER_12]: But we'll also figure out how to share some of this information so that people can either watch the video with the presentation

1248
02:09:55,667 --> 02:09:56,908
[SPEAKER_12]: It's obviously on our YouTube channel.

1249
02:09:56,928 --> 02:09:59,068
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll figure all of that out coming out of the meetings.

1250
02:09:59,088 --> 02:10:01,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of, there are people online who are interested.

1251
02:10:01,869 --> 02:10:04,930
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll figure out a way for you to give us some input.

1252
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:07,971
[SPEAKER_12]: All of those things are to come.

1253
02:10:08,572 --> 02:10:18,715
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing that the building committee needs to do tonight is provide some guidance to SNMA about the things that we are interested in cost estimation for.

1254
02:10:18,815 --> 02:10:24,397
[SPEAKER_12]: So big to Matt's point, I didn't hear anything tonight that said we should not

1255
02:10:25,214 --> 02:10:36,544
[SPEAKER_12]: get this high level cost estimate for the options that were presented, but we do need to take a vote of some kind to make sure that we're giving clear direction about what's happening next.

1256
02:10:37,205 --> 02:10:40,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So are there any, is there anyone who would like to make a motion?

1257
02:10:41,909 --> 02:10:42,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1258
02:10:42,329 --> 02:10:46,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I move we move forward with costing all the options presented tonight.

1259
02:10:46,753 --> 02:10:47,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1260
02:10:48,014 --> 02:10:48,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of stuff.

1261
02:10:48,595 --> 02:10:48,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1262
02:10:48,855 --> 02:10:49,196
[SPEAKER_12]: So motion.

1263
02:10:52,309 --> 02:10:56,830
[SPEAKER_12]: to move them all forward for initial cost estimating by Ken, seconded by Nicole.

1264
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:00,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Questions before we take that vote.

1265
02:11:00,851 --> 02:11:06,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But one question, are we limited to this batch of 57 concepts?

1266
02:11:09,933 --> 02:11:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: If in the course of our dialogues and our meetings, another concept that hasn't been presented

1267
02:11:21,365 --> 02:11:23,946
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes undesirable.

1268
02:11:25,167 --> 02:11:36,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I think if something becomes apparent or evolves from sort of our study and review of the cost information that comes back, it doesn't preclude us from investigating an alternative path as we go forward.

1269
02:11:37,912 --> 02:11:49,057
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what that one would be just yet, because I think we've tried to turn over every stone in terms of just high level options, but no, we're not going to be precluded from looking at something else as we go forward.

1270
02:11:51,563 --> 02:11:52,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Other questions?

1271
02:11:52,784 --> 02:11:55,245
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, I'm going to call the roll.

1272
02:11:56,105 --> 02:12:01,868
