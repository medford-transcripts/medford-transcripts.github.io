Hello, everybody. Hope you're having a great week. Have some good news. First up is that we had a groundbreaking at Gillis Park. That's a $1.4 million project that our team was hard at work over the last year and a half getting ready for. That's going to be a 12 to 18 month process. So thank you for your patience as we work through that. But it's going to be wonderful. Next up, we have a ribbon cutting at Morrison Park. That is done. The work has been done, and that will open
