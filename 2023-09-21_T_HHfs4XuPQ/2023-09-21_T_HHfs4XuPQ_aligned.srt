5
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:14,856
That's a $1.4 million project that our team was hard at work over the last year and a half getting ready for.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:17,338
That's going to be a 12 to 18 month process.

7
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,440
So thank you for your patience as we work through that.
