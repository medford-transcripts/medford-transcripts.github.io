00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings.

2
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:45,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, our guest is Nate Merritt, who is running for city council.

4
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:58,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also what we call, or we call him the kid from Riverside.

5
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,710
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the show, Nate.

6
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,451
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

7
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:02,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well, John.

8
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,051
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

9
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:03,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.

10
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:04,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.

11
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:11,273
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, we're just going to do a quick, we're having you back on just to answer a quick couple of questions.

12
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,974
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on with MedFed.

13
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:18,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just want to get into a couple of questions.

14
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to go ahead and do this.

15
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:23,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to repeat again.

16
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:24,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to have you back with us.

17
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:25,757
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

18
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:35,685
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic that I hear all the time, everywhere I go, really is the zoning and method.

19
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:54,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, it's just between what's going on with the council, people in the streets, neighborhoods, you name it, the squares, I don't have to tell you, you know what's going on, but, you know, what's your, you know, how do you feel about it right now, Nate?

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,008
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, give us,

21
00:01:55,961 --> 00:02:00,294
[SPEAKER_01]: a good honest look at how you feel about the zoning.

22
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you go from there.

23
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:16,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I think that it was a very good thing that the mayor helped basically hit the pause button on the way things were progressing based on the turnout of folks where they basically were not informed.

24
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,258
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of confusion, a lot of jargon thrown in there.

25
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:28,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I had come out and spoke at CDB board meetings as well as even the initial meeting over at the Roberts.

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,982
[SPEAKER_00]: when this started with the Salem Street rezoning.

27
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:34,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked some pointed questions that I don't think were ever answered.

28
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:38,448
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those was property tax implications for current homeowners, right?

29
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:44,532
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden they're in a single family home, a single family zone, and it gets up zoned to a MX pick a number.

30
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:51,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is their house that they're just trying to live in and get by day by day, right?

31
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:52,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of a sudden worth,

32
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:56,840
[SPEAKER_00]: say hundreds of thousands of dollars more, they have no intention to sell.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,421
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to live, right?

34
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they got kids, maybe they're elderly, who knows.

35
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:07,243
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that raises their property value, which sounds great if they want to sell.

36
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:08,864
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people I know don't want to sell.

37
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:13,008
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just want to live their lives here.

38
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:20,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met so many people on the campaign trail now who have told me where they grew up in the house they were in, or their families in that house.

39
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they have any intention of necessarily leaving.

40
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,776
[SPEAKER_00]: There's generations of people in Medford.

41
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:26,456
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome.

42
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:31,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was concerned about the negative impacts to those people.

43
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,411
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of ignored, to be quite honest.

44
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard a definitive answer.

45
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,495
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I never saw along the way were goals.

46
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why are we doing all this zoning?

47
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:44,359
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the intent?

48
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:47,622
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to build X number of quote-unquote affordable units.

49
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:54,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so first we have to define what is affordable, because that's something that changes to everybody, but for some people a $700,000 house is not affordable.

50
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:57,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

51
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:58,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it rentals?

52
00:03:58,793 --> 00:03:59,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ownership?

53
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:00,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it condos?

54
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the volume that you're looking for?

55
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw those actual goals.

56
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,176
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed very much ready, fire, aim.

57
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:07,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

58
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:10,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a lot of other things that have been happening over the past couple of years.

59
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,398
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been ready, fire, aim.

60
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really glad to see that this has the pause button put on it.

61
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,942
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess I would caution people where I don't think there's any intention of stopping.

62
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:22,547
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.

63
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,948
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the word of caution.

64
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,608
[SPEAKER_00]: People have paused, but let's be real.

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an election season.

66
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly did not go over well with folks on the city council.

67
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they were inclined to hit the pause button until at least November.

68
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:39,011
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

69
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:39,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

70
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:45,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So just so I can clarify, I understand what you're saying.

71
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:53,735
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're basically saying is it's not that you're against zoning, okay?

72
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:57,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're against what they want to do in the neighborhoods.

73
00:04:58,718 --> 00:04:59,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you agree?

74
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:05,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I don't know what's going to happen in Meffitt Square, West Meffitt Square, you know, all these squares.

75
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:12,706
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess my question to you, just this is the follow up and then we'll get off the subject.

76
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:17,609
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question to you is, you want zoning.

77
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:23,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how we get- It's how and what are the goals and what are we trying to achieve?

78
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:29,589
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right, this was a, you know, I have a hammer and let's whack the whole city.

79
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was literally one size fits all.

80
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,933
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a proposal and RFP came in for Medford Square and to redevelop Medford Square and people want that to happen and that's fine.

81
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it probably should, let's be honest.

82
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:45,075
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no opportunity to take that in and see what the effects are.

83
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with perhaps parts of Mystic Ave.

84
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little mixed on Mystic Ave because you could turn it into all housing, but then you lose all your commercial space.

85
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:59,960
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best things that happened in recent history was I think it was Herb Chambers, right?

86
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,241
[SPEAKER_00]: That bought the property there.

87
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,502
[SPEAKER_00]: That's commercial property.

88
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:03,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

89
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:09,232
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the worst things that happened was the MBTA came in and took the Budweiser property.

90
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:12,717
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a million dollars a year in revenue gone from the city.

91
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will do it.

92
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a pilot maybe, but it's never going to be a million bucks.

93
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:27,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a practical side to this where commercial pays twice the rate that residential does and a lot of other net benefits.

94
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:32,812
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't draw on your services versus residential tends to draw on your services for a reason.

95
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,894
[SPEAKER_00]: People have children, people have medical emergencies, people, right?

96
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:40,757
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just putting people in houses, it's can the system absorb it?

97
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:46,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely, I think there are areas to look at, but the one size fits all approach

98
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:55,553
[SPEAKER_00]: was obviously not popular for many reasons, but I think part of it's the, without understanding the cons, you always got to pay the pros and the cons.

99
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:56,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

100
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:56,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

101
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:59,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's what I hear.

102
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:04,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think everyone that I talk to anyhow, they're for zoning.

103
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, they're not for the way they want to do it.

104
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:10,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one size fits all and coming into these

105
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,496
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people bought single family homes for a reason.

106
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,758
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to live on the streets they live on.

107
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I bought a single family home in Medford in 2014.

108
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:25,839
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where I could afford responsibly a single family home.

109
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I didn't wanna have an apartment and I didn't wanna have a two family.

110
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm in a neighborhood that's been very well developed up, right?

111
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Wellington, right near Locust Street.

112
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:38,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Locust Street project came online.

113
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,189
[SPEAKER_00]: You had apartments come online in Middlesex.

114
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:41,630
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a lot of development.

115
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,653
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I know Cappy's now, I guess, right?

116
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,576
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be part of the, is it 40B that that's coming under?

117
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right, that's gonna be 200 something units.

118
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:57,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like there's no development happening.

119
00:07:58,206 --> 00:07:59,027
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.

120
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:09,449
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe not seen by a lot of people within the city, but when you couple that with the square, we don't know the ramifications.

121
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you haven't stated the goals.

122
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the goal is stated, then we can figure out what is the best path to work for the goals and are the goals tenable.

123
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:18,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

124
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:20,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answers.

125
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we got the zoning issue.

126
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you answered some important questions.

127
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,351
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing, and this will be the last question.

128
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:36,973
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just going to be sort of quick shows.

129
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:44,716
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing in the last question for you is another major issue.

130
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:47,403
[SPEAKER_01]: is the new school.

131
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:50,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep hearing about the new high school, the new high school.

132
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to build a new one?

133
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to refurbish?

134
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's things being thrown.

135
00:08:56,891 --> 00:09:01,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm no expert, but I try to stay up to date with a lot of these things.

136
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many things being thrown out.

137
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone disagrees that it'd be nice to get a new high school, all right?

138
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's part of the issue.

139
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:24,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the vocational school is incredible up there, what they've done to that side of the building.

140
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:34,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyhow, I'll stop talking now and just basically ask you, what do you think is a solution to the high school problem?

141
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:42,684
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the good news is that a lot of this responsibility is in the purview of the school committee, okay?

142
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:50,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So city council gets an up or down vote to do we put it to a ballot if we need to somehow fund it, right, by raising the tax levy.

143
00:09:51,688 --> 00:10:01,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So that said, yes, I have also seen, in fact, the city published on Facebook, I believe, saying, we are getting a new high school.

144
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the headline, new high school.

145
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:14,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And then buried way down after they talk about how the architect or the developer had been identified, there's a long process that happens.

146
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:20,298
[SPEAKER_00]: says, in there, we're gonna rack and stack the options, courses of action, right?

147
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:26,883
[SPEAKER_00]: COA1 is you get, tear down the building, something on top of it.

148
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:31,966
[SPEAKER_00]: COA2 is we go and renovate, right?

149
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:36,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody wants a modern high school, right?

150
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,251
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a very difference between saying modern and new.

151
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:42,834
[SPEAKER_00]: New to me is knock it down, wrecking ball, build on top of it.

152
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:43,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

153
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:59,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm concerned with the fact that that has been said and stated both by Jenny Graham in material that she has published and trying to say some of us are not for a new high school.

154
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:03,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two kids.

155
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:05,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a two-year-old and a five-year-old.

156
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to go to good schools.

157
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:12,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the kids in the city to have a great opportunity to learn and get a good education.

158
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:22,251
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, the school that I went to, right, was built in the 70s, and you're talking to a guy that was accepted to the Naval and Air Force Academies, okay?

159
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So the school wasn't much to look at.

160
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:30,094
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily the outside of the building that matters, it's the quality of the education.

161
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,955
[SPEAKER_00]: That should always be number one focus.

162
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:36,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's your goal, this is gonna come back just like the zoning.

163
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the goals?

164
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:40,205
[SPEAKER_00]: then how do we get there?

165
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we get there responsibly?

166
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:52,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are elderly people, for instance, where if they see their taxes go up $2,000 a year, that might not be tenable for them if they're on fixed incomes.

167
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:59,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I, I'm gonna try to do some memory recall on math here, so I might have this a little wrong.

168
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the Somerville High School project, so that was a, it was new, but it wasn't.

169
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:09,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they did it in phases and built on top of the existing location.

170
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:14,674
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, I think, ran to the tune of $260 million.

171
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:22,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelsea, within the last 20 years, I think, rebuilt a high school or built a new high school.

172
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:24,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that was in the same place or not.

173
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:27,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Malden renovated theirs, and they chose to renovate it.

174
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:33,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they did it with 90% actually paid by the MSBA.

175
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:46,698
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of options, but when the rhetoric out there is new, and then you say, oh, but we're going to go do a study to see which is the better course of action.

176
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:53,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you really trust the process when you say, I want new, but we're going to look at all the options?

177
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,791
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a saying that they had when I was back in high school and we were in biology class, I remember, and you don't get the things to work out just right.

178
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,512
[SPEAKER_00]: When all else fails, manipulate the data.

179
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, exactly.

180
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:08,413
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disingenuous to the process when people come out and word choice matters here.

181
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,693
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all want a modern school.

182
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,114
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want a good education for our children.

183
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:16,056
[SPEAKER_00]: But how we get there, we have to get there responsibly.

184
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:20,459
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't have our elderly people losing their homes over this.

185
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,703
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a good way to, yes, bring up, maybe it's public-private partnerships.

186
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:32,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we had a million dollars a year coming in, that would help offset the cost of that high school.

187
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:38,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking at least 260 million because everything got more expensive since Somerville started.

188
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville started their project in 2018.

189
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:41,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it was before COVID.

190
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Building materials have doubled since then.

191
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:48,846
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky you're talking 260 million plus 4% interest.

192
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some math ahead of time.

193
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,888
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about $350 million.

194
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a number or a guesstimate

195
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,970
[SPEAKER_00]: a ROM put to this project to begin with.

196
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:04,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I think it's very dangerous to say new, new, new, and then you could be setting people up for disappointment, just like the overrides.

197
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:09,398
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where communication matters, word choice matters.

198
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:16,783
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against a new anything, but again, I wanna see the options and we rack and stack the pros and cons.

199
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:17,684
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we get?

200
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:24,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really value for taxpayer money, which I think is important and a valuable education, which is most important for our youth.

201
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:31,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We want what's best for everyone, all the kids that attend Meffitt schools.

202
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:36,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to do it responsibly.

203
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,145
[SPEAKER_00]: John, I live in a 1908 house.

204
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:39,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

205
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have a brand new house.

206
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,687
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?

207
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 1908.

208
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:47,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard University teaches kids in buildings that are from the 1800s.

209
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

210
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:49,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

211
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:50,692
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

212
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:51,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

213
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:51,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

214
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:56,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for coming on the show again.

215
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, best of luck to you.

216
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're out there campaigning.

217
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a lot of work.

218
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,786
[SPEAKER_01]: All I can say is keep it up.

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, best wishes.

220
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,448
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good candidate.

221
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:12,569
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a great candidate.

222
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the people of Method come out for you.

223
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was nice to have you.

224
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:20,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

225
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:27,202
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear your thoughts on the zoning and on the school.

226
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we had a lot more time, Nate, but we don't.

227
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you very much.

228
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:35,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

229
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everyone that's watching the show.

230
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:46,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want everyone to make sure they check out our website, methodhappenings.com.

231
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:52,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even begin to explain how good it's going for the show.

232
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want people to know, boy, we got some great shows coming up.

233
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of people looking to come on.

234
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,892
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes us feel great.

235
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole crew, everyone that works on this show.

236
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:12,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank you because it's guests like you help make the show what it is, Nate.

237
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a great weekend and thanks for joining us tonight.

238
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:17,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, John.
