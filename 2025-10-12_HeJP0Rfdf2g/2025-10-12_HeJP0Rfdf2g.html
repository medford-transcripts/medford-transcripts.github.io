    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=31.03s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=36.053s">And</a>  the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=46.26s">And</a>  today, our guest is Nate Merritt, who is running for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=53.865s">And</a>  he's also what we call, or we call him the kid from Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=59.15s">So</a>  welcome to the show, Nate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=60.73s">How</a>  you doing?</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=61.971s">Doing</a>  well, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=62.671s">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=63.111s">Thanks</a>  for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=64.051s">Doing</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=65.092s">As</a>  you know, we're just going to do a quick, we're having you back on just to answer a quick couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=72.153s">There's</a>  so much going on with MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=75.614s">So</a>  we just want to get into a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=78.395s">So</a>  we're just going to go ahead and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=81.176s">I'm</a>  going to repeat again. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=83.276s">Nice</a>  to have you back with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=85.397s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=86.943s">The</a>  topic that I hear all the time, everywhere I go, really is the zoning and method. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=96.785s">Boy,</a>  it's just between what's going on with the council, people in the streets, neighborhoods, you name it, the squares, I don't have to tell you, you know what's going on, but, you know, what's your, you know, how do you feel about it right now, Nate? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=114.448s">You</a>  know, give us, <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=115.961s">a</a>  good honest look at how you feel about the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=120.354s">I'll</a>  let you go from there.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=122.195s">Sure,</a>  I think that it was a very good thing that the mayor helped basically hit the pause button on the way things were progressing based on the turnout of folks where they basically were not informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=137.258s">There</a>  was a lot of confusion, a lot of jargon thrown in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=140.298s">I</a>  had come out and spoke at CDB board meetings as well as even the initial meeting over at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=148.98s">when</a>  this started with the Salem Street rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=151.502s">And</a>  I asked some pointed questions that I don't think were ever answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=154.965s">One</a>  of those was property tax implications for current homeowners, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=158.568s">All</a>  of a sudden they're in a single family home, a single family zone, and it gets up zoned to a MX pick a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=164.552s">Now</a>  is their house that they're just trying to live in and get by day by day, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=171.358s">Now</a>  all of a sudden worth, <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=173.399s">say</a>  hundreds of thousands of dollars more, they have no intention to sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=176.9s">They</a>  just want to live, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=178.661s">Maybe</a>  they got kids, maybe they're elderly, who knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=182.282s">But</a>  now that raises their property value, which sounds great if they want to sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=187.283s">But</a>  a lot of people I know don't want to sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=189.806s">So</a>  they just want to live their lives here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=193.188s">I've</a>  met so many people on the campaign trail now who have told me where they grew up in the house they were in, or their families in that house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=200.552s">And</a>  I don't think they have any intention of necessarily leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=203.474s">There's</a>  generations of people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=205.816s">It's</a>  pretty awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=208.257s">So</a>  I was concerned about the negative impacts to those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=214.028s">It</a>  was kind of ignored, to be quite honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=216.431s">I</a>  never heard a definitive answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=218.052s">The</a>  other thing I never saw along the way were goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=221.256s">Like,</a>  why are we doing all this zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=223.378s">What</a>  is the intent? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=224.399s">You</a>  want to build X number of quote-unquote affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=227.823s">Alright,</a>  so first we have to define what is affordable, because that's something that changes to everybody, but for some people a $700,000 house is not affordable.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=236.952s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=237.852s">Is</a>  it rentals? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=238.793s">Is</a>  it ownership? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=239.733s">Is</a>  it condos? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=241.054s">And</a>  what's the volume that you're looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=243.895s">I</a>  never saw those actual goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=245.556s">It</a>  seemed very much ready, fire, aim.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=247.736s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=248.037s">Just</a>  a lot of other things that have been happening over the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=251.318s">It's</a>  been ready, fire, aim. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=252.939s">So</a>  I was really glad to see that this has the pause button put on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=257.38s">But</a>  I guess I would caution people where I don't think there's any intention of stopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=262.207s">right</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=263.087s">So</a>  that's the word of caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=265.988s">People</a>  have paused, but let's be real. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=268.208s">It's</a>  an election season. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=270.129s">And</a>  it certainly did not go over well with folks on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=274.83s">So</a>  I think they were inclined to hit the pause button until at least November.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=278.931s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=279.371s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=280.471s">So</a>  just so I can clarify, I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=288.532s">What</a>  you're basically saying is it's not that you're against zoning, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=294.716s">I</a>  mean, you're against what they want to do in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=298.718s">I</a>  mean, do you agree? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=299.999s">And</a>  I'm not, I don't know what's going to happen in Medford Square, West Medford Square, you know, all these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=306.663s">But</a>  I guess my question to you, just this is the follow up and then we'll get off the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=312.746s">But</a>  my question to you is, you want zoning.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=318.585s">It's</a>  just how we get- It's how and what are the goals and what are we trying to achieve? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=324.047s">So,</a>  right, this was a, you know, I have a hammer and let's whack the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=330.229s">And</a>  it was literally one size fits all. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=332.43s">You</a>  have a proposal and RFP came in for Medford Square and to redevelop Medford Square and people want that to happen and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=339.073s">And</a>  some of it probably should, let's be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=342.054s">But</a>  there's no opportunity to take that in and see what the effects are. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=346.107s">And</a>  same with perhaps parts of Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=349.25s">I'm</a>  a little mixed on Mystic Ave because you could turn it into all housing, but then you lose all your commercial space. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=355.696s">One</a>  of the best things that happened in recent history was I think it was Herb Chambers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=359.98s">That</a>  bought the property there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=361.401s">That's</a>  commercial property.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=362.902s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=363.804s">One</a>  of the worst things that happened was the MBTA came in and took the Budweiser property. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=369.252s">So</a>  that's a million dollars a year in revenue gone from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=373.097s">And</a>  then it will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=374.539s">It'll</a>  be a pilot maybe, but it's never going to be a million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=377.904s">So</a>  there's a practical side to this where commercial pays twice the rate that residential does and a lot of other net benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=387.049s">They</a>  also don't draw on your services versus residential tends to draw on your services for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=392.852s">People</a>  have children, people have medical emergencies, people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=395.954s">So</a>  it's not just putting people in houses, it's can the system absorb it? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=401.237s">So</a>  absolutely, I think there are areas to look at, but the one size fits all approach <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=407.685s">was</a>  obviously not popular for many reasons, but I think part of it's the, without understanding the cons, you always got to pay the pros and the cons.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=415.913s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=416.313s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=416.714s">And</a>  I guess that's what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=419.857s">I</a>  mean, I think everyone that I talk to anyhow, they're for zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=425.142s">It's</a>  just, they're not for the way they want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=427.444s">And</a>  the one size fits all and coming into these <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=431.494s">You</a>  know, people bought single family homes for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=434.536s">They</a>  want to live on the streets they live on.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=437.479s">And</a>  yeah, I bought a single family home in Medford in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=442.297s">because</a>  that's where I could afford responsibly a single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=445.959s">I</a>  mean, I didn't wanna have an apartment and I didn't wanna have a two family. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=449.662s">Now</a>  I'm in a neighborhood that's been very well developed up, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=452.344s">I'm</a>  in Wellington, right near Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=455.886s">And</a>  the Locust Street project came online. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=458.128s">You</a>  had apartments come online in Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=460.489s">You've</a>  had a lot of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=461.65s">There's,</a>  I know Cappy's now, I guess, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=465.673s">That's</a>  gonna be part of the, is it 40B that that's coming under? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=472.445s">So,</a>  right, that's gonna be 200 something units. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=475.406s">So</a>  it's not like there's no development happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=478.206s">There</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=480.247s">It's</a>  maybe not seen by a lot of people within the city, but when you couple that with the square, we don't know the ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=490.289s">And</a>  again, you haven't stated the goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=492.93s">So</a>  once the goal is stated, then we can figure out what is the best path to work for the goals and are the goals tenable.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=498.551s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=500.192s">Good</a>  answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=502.927s">I'm</a>  glad we got the zoning issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=506.789s">I</a>  think you answered some important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=510.21s">The</a>  next thing, and this will be the last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=513.391s">These</a>  are just going to be sort of quick shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=518.913s">The</a>  next thing in the last question for you is another major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=526.482s">is</a>  the new school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=527.463s">We</a>  keep hearing about the new high school, the new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=530.185s">Are</a>  we going to build a new one? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=532.367s">Are</a>  we going to refurbish? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=534.108s">I</a>  mean, there's things being thrown. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=536.891s">And</a>  I'm no expert, but I try to stay up to date with a lot of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=542.515s">And</a>  there's so many things being thrown out. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=546.539s">I</a>  don't think anyone disagrees that it'd be nice to get a new high school, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=553.82s">I</a>  don't think that's part of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=556.702s">And</a>  I know the vocational school is incredible up there, what they've done to that side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=565.367s">So</a>  anyhow, I'll stop talking now and just basically ask you, what do you think is a solution to the high school problem?</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=575.973s">So,</a>  I mean, the good news is that a lot of this responsibility is in the purview of the school committee, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=583.204s">So</a>  city council gets an up or down vote to do we put it to a ballot if we need to somehow fund it, right, by raising the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=591.688s">So</a>  that said, yes, I have also seen, in fact, the city published on Facebook, I believe, saying, we are getting a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=602.417s">And</a>  that was the headline, new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=606.201s">And</a>  then buried way down after they talk about how the architect or the developer had been identified, there's a long process that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=615.995s">says,</a>  in there, we're gonna rack and stack the options, courses of action, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=620.338s">COA1</a>  is you get, tear down the building, something on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=626.963s">COA2</a>  is we go and renovate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=632.226s">I</a>  think everybody wants a modern high school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=636.849s">But</a>  there's a very difference between saying modern and new. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=639.411s">New</a>  to me is knock it down, wrecking ball, build on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=643.354s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=645.883s">I</a>  think I'm concerned with the fact that that has been said and stated both by Jenny Graham in material that she has published and trying to say some of us are not for a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=662.335s">I</a>  have two kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=664.176s">I've</a>  got a two-year-old and a five-year-old. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=665.857s">I</a>  want them to go to good schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=667.999s">I</a>  want all the kids in the city to have a great opportunity to learn and get a good education. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=673.768s">That</a>  said, the school that I went to, right, was built in the 70s, and you're talking to a guy that was accepted to the Naval and Air Force Academies, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=682.931s">So</a>  the school wasn't much to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=685.952s">It's</a>  not necessarily the outside of the building that matters, it's the quality of the education. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=690.154s">That</a>  should always be number one focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=692.335s">And</a>  if that's your goal, this is gonna come back just like the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=696.736s">What</a>  are the goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=699.145s">then</a>  how do we get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=700.865s">And</a>  how do we get there responsibly? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=703.146s">Because</a>  there are elderly people, for instance, where if they see their taxes go up $2,000 a year, that might not be tenable for them if they're on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=713.008s">So</a>  if I, I'm gonna try to do some memory recall on math here, so I might have this a little wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=719.89s">I</a>  believe the Somerville High School project, so that was a, it was new, but it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=724.051s">I</a>  believe they did it in phases and built on top of the existing location. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=731.053s">That</a>  one, I think, ran to the tune of $260 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=736.895s">Chelsea,</a>  within the last 20 years, I think, rebuilt a high school or built a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=742.997s">I</a>  don't know if that was in the same place or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=744.858s">Malden</a>  renovated theirs, and they chose to renovate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=747.498s">And</a>  I believe they did it with 90% actually paid by the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=758.524s">There's</a>  a whole bunch of options, but when the rhetoric out there is new, and then you say, oh, but we're going to go do a study to see which is the better course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=767.589s">Now</a>  do you really trust the process when you say, I want new, but we're going to look at all the options? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=773.23s">There</a>  was a saying that they had when I was back in high school and we were in biology class, I remember, and you don't get the things to work out just right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=779.831s">When</a>  all else fails, manipulate the data.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=781.992s">Right,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=783.552s">It's</a>  disingenuous to the process when people come out and word choice matters here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=788.673s">I</a>  think we all want a modern school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=790.934s">We</a>  all want a good education for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=793.614s">But</a>  how we get there, we have to get there responsibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=796.436s">And</a>  you can't have our elderly people losing their homes over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=800.879s">There</a>  has to be a good way to, yes, bring up, maybe it's public-private partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=807.613s">Maybe</a>  if we had a million dollars a year coming in, that would help offset the cost of that high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=813.317s">So</a>  you're talking at least 260 million because everything got more expensive since Somerville started. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=818.72s">Somerville</a>  started their project in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=819.981s">Now</a>  it was before COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=821.662s">Building</a>  materials have doubled since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=824.143s">We're</a>  lucky you're talking 260 million plus 4% interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=828.886s">I</a>  did some math ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=830.147s">It's</a>  about $350 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=831.928s">I</a>  haven't seen a number or a guesstimate <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=835.029s">a</a>  ROM put to this project to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=837.591s">So</a>  that's where I think it's very dangerous to say new, new, new, and then you could be setting people up for disappointment, just like the overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=845.336s">This</a>  is where communication matters, word choice matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=849.879s">I'm</a>  not against a new anything, but again, I wanna see the options and we rack and stack the pros and cons. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=857.043s">And</a>  what do we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=857.764s">It's</a>  really value for taxpayer money, which I think is important and a valuable education, which is most important for our youth.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=865.097s">We</a>  want what's best for everyone, all the kids that attend Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=872.461s">And</a>  we just want to do it responsibly.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=877.504s">John,</a>  I live in a 1908 house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=879.526s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=879.866s">I</a>  would love to have a brand new house. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=881.327s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=882.748s">It</a>  was a 1908. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=883.588s">Harvard</a>  University teaches kids in buildings that are from the 1800s. <a href="https://youtu.be/HeJP0Rfdf2g&t=887.43s">Right.</a> </p>
