15
00:01:56,537 --> 00:02:04,239
A review of the goals and performance evaluation of superintendent Maurice Edward Vincent for school year 2019 to 2020.

16
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,979
Signed by superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,401
I know we were provided by email the superintendent goals fiscal year 19 and 20

18
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:25,271
and also the self-evaluation for school year 2019-2020.

19
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,512
Mayor, I think we lost member Rousseau.

20
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:32,413
He said he lost internet and is rebooting right now.

21
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,234
Just wanted to make sure you knew that.

22
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:38,356
Say that one more time, member Graham.

23
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,556
We lost Paul.

24
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:43,397
His internet went out and he's rebooting, so he'll be back shortly.

25
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,878
Okay, we'll wait for him.

26
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,629
we could take the roll, Member McLaughlin?

27
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,431
Yes, thank you.

28
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,092
Member Graham?

29
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:57,493
Here.

30
00:02:58,713 --> 00:02:59,314
Member Kretz?

31
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:00,334
Here.

32
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,576
Member McLaughlin, here.

33
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:04,496
Member Musil?

34
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,157
Here.

35
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:07,098
Member Russo?

36
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,080
Wait a second.

37
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,721
Mayor?

38
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:15,742
Here.

39
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,222
You just waiting for Paul member McLaughlin.

40
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:24,324
I think we can start without him and you can just mock him when he comes in late.

41
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:25,644
Okay.

42
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:27,405
Please.

43
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:33,015
So six present, one waiting.

44
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:37,420
Sounds great.

45
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,438
Dr. Edward-Vincent, do you want to give an overview and then we'll take questions?

46
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,058
Yes, yes, I will.

47
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,819
So good evening, members of the school committee.

48
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:03,000
This evening, I am going to just be giving a quick overview of my goals from school year 2019-2020.

49
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,101
My key goals for that time under district improvement.

50
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,742
My first goal was the district strategic plan.

51
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:24,112
synthesizing district priority goals to develop targeted multi-year strategic plan to guide all our work, our partnerships, et cetera, with a laser-like focus on instruction.

52
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:34,304
Our next district improvement goal was developing a district-wide focus on instruction, working with principals

53
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:43,968
and other district leaders to establish a common language about instruction as a foundation for their future work to improve instruction.

54
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:45,929
Our first

55
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,932
student learning goal for school year 1920.

56
00:05:49,572 --> 00:06:03,155
The student learning goal was elementary mathematics, improving elementary achievement outcomes in mathematics by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of mathematics.

57
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:11,877
And one of the ways that that work took place was through rounds in collaboration with Lesley University.

58
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:29,804
The professional practice goal for school year 1920 was the programming around the NISP induction program, the new superintendent induction program, which is endorsed by DESE.

59
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:35,290
The professional practice goal was to complete

60
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:50,909
the district strategic plan, attending sessions and assignments that were in alignment with the NSUP guidelines, which are in accordance with the state.

61
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:58,673
So those were the goals that were presented on November 18th, 2000 and at the 2019 school committee meeting.

62
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:20,015
Based on those goals, I submitted to you self-evaluation in regards to the work that I completed in regards to those goals.

63
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:34,720
In that document that you received, I did put the hyperlink to refer back to the superintendent's goals.

64
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:42,286
But in addition to that, I am going to read some of the narrative that I submitted to you.

65
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:47,430
So this evaluation is based from July 2019 through June 2020.

66
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:58,909
Please refer to the goals that I just gave a quick overview that were established in November of 2019.

67
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:14,035
Please note that due to COVID-19, the pandemic, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Medford Public Schools closed and no longer offered in-person instruction for the remainder of the school year.

68
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:23,462
This unexpected closure required all schools to develop an alternative instructional method, which no one was prepared for.

69
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:32,666
The pandemic did in fact shift the way Medford Public Schools functioned, how teachers taught and how students learned.

70
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:41,991
One of our first priorities was to redeploy all Chromebooks and get them into the hands of our students so that they could receive instruction.

71
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:49,828
As a district, we hosted multiple Chromebook distribution days to get a device into the hands of our students.

72
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:59,792
In addition, we found creative ways to get additional instructional supplies to our students in an effort to strengthen the connection between teachers and students.

73
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:09,295
At the onset of the pandemic, the Medford Public Schools created the following documents to address temporary closure.

74
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:14,756
we created the extended MPS closure K to five.

75
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:20,679
We also created the extended MPS closure grades six to 12.

76
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:39,228
The above documents were created because the guidance we received from my desi dictated that teachers should not teach any new content because of uneven distribution of resources across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

77
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:45,478
In fact, the guidance stressed that all instruction should be enrichment only.

78
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:53,902
Therefore, preliminary feedback about the extended closure documents commented on a lack of rigor.

79
00:09:55,623 --> 00:10:03,207
However, by the last week of March, collaborative work between the school and the association leadership

80
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,211
began on our distance learning plan.

81
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:11,653
This first plan was presented in early April to the school committee.

82
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:17,155
Distance learning plan 1.0 was the first version.

83
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:27,179
By mid-May, distance learning plan 2.0 was the final document that carried us until the end of the year.

84
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:34,776
I also submitted a document detailing the chronology of events.

85
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:50,441
In summary, school year 2019-2020 will be recorded by historians as the year of the pandemic, which demanded incredible flexibility on the part of all educational leaders.

86
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:58,283
Life as we knew it would change as everyone's priorities shifted toward the safety and health of all.

87
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:08,191
So under district improvement goals, the district strategic plan was presented to the school committee.

88
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:23,023
And at that time it was accepted as a draft plan with the intent of continuing to work on the strategic plan to present a final plan.

89
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:28,368
And so I did include the hyperlinks there to that document.

90
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:44,331
Under student learning goal, our elementary math program, I talked about the superintendent has made a concerted effort to address elementary achievement in mathematics.

91
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:51,413
And during year two, she's expanded the learning walks to include the entire district.

92
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:57,516
She continues to partner with Lesley University and engages them in math learning walks.

93
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:05,286
She is working closely with the math director and she has encouraged active engagement of the elementary math coaches.

94
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:15,053
The math learning walks scaled up to include grades K through 12 district-wide, including the Curtis Tufts School.

95
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:25,760
The walks expanded to include all administrators and school committee members to join and be part of the professional learning community that was establishing.

96
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:42,475
There were hyperlinks in the schedule presented as well regarding the learning walk schedules and regarding the learning walk dates that had taken place during the 2019-2020 school year.

97
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:49,139
According to the professional practice goal, the new superintendent induction program

98
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,218
I successfully completed year two.

99
00:12:53,978 --> 00:13:06,501
I attended all of our sessions, both those that were in person until the pandemic and now continued for the remainder of that year, virtually once the pandemic hit.

100
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:15,123
Dr. Carla Baer has come before the school committee and has provided leadership, coaching and support.

101
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:34,664
The draft district strategic plan, again, was presented during year two of the NIFA plan, and it was presented to the school committee during the 2019-2020 school year.

102
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:43,712
Under the standards set forth under instructional leadership, standard one,

103
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,658
Evidence of practice.

104
00:13:50,299 --> 00:14:03,585
Standard one talks about the educational leader promotes the learning and growth of all students and success of all staff by cultivating a shared vision that makes powerful teaching and learning the central focus of schooling.

105
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:07,687
The following supports as evidence of practice.

106
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,729
School committee documentation for school year 2019-2020

107
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:42,016
Medford Public Schools blog and websites, math learning walks in collaboration with Lesley University, science learning walks, which took place as well, K to 12, MPS monthly administrative meetings, the work of CCSR, support of co-teaching and EL initiatives, adoption of illustrative math,

108
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,163
and our new science curriculum FOSS being fully implemented.

109
00:14:50,464 --> 00:15:11,175
Please note that in addition to the math learning walks being scaled from elementary K to five to include K through 12, the science learning walks did take place for K-12 as well with Mr. Rocco Sierra as the work was being scaled up.

110
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:21,595
Additionally, we had the intention of scaling up to the Humanities Learning Walks K-12.

111
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:33,161
And unfortunately, with the timing of the pandemic, we were not able to start the formal Humanities Learning Walks K-12 because at that time,

112
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:45,229
you know, the landscape was shifting and it was not able to take place because school was no longer, we were no longer having in-person instruction.

113
00:15:46,710 --> 00:16:03,044
Under Standard 2, management and operations promotes the learning and growth of all students and the success of all staff by ensuring a safe, efficient, and effective learning environment, using resources to implement appropriate curriculum staffing and scheduling.

114
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:26,520
Again, as documentation, evidence of practice, school committee documentation for school year 1920, our online resources, our specific committee of the whole, subcommittee meetings, school committee meetings, executive session meetings, where we addressed management and operations.

115
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:53,811
a transparent budget process, which were all individualized committee of the whole, meetings focused on budget, FOSS science curriculum implementation, illustrative math curriculum implementation at the middle school levels, CCSR initiatives, all schools being fully functional, all schools being fully staffed,

116
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:57,715
MPS school schedules and calendars.

117
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:17,033
Under indicator three, family, community, and engagement promotes the learning and growth of all students and the success of all staff through effective partnerships with families, community organizations, and other stakeholders that support the mission of the school district.

118
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,256
Again, school committee documentation,

119
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:49,321
our blogs, all levels participating in school events, our middle school lottery that, due to the pandemic, took place in an online fashion, as opposed to being in person at the library, which is how we did it in school year 2018-19, Medford Family Network events, reaching out to families in the community, participating in the Mayor's Roundtable, which addresses also social, emotional wellness,

120
00:17:50,262 --> 00:18:09,721
Additional CCSR initiatives, West Medford Community Center events, our senior awards nights, etc., which took place, including our high school graduation virtually, but they took place nonetheless, to be inclusive of our families.

121
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:25,885
Additionally, under professional culture standard for promotes the success for all students by nurturing and sustaining a school culture of reflective practice high expectations and continuous learning for staff.

122
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,928
Under professional culture.

123
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:38,458
We have the math learning walks, the science learning walks, again, using the five core actions.

124
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:53,646
Our formal back to school welcome for teachers and staff promoting a professional culture, district professional development days, our school committee retreat days with

125
00:18:54,786 --> 00:19:06,670
Dorothy Presser in December of 2019 and always being committed to promoting the Mustang way and Mustang pride at all opportunities.

126
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:21,655
So I do wish to say that my core values when I came to Medford and they still exist are ACE, achievement for all, collaboration for all and equity for all.

127
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:34,264
Although this was not the year that we expected it to be, I am proud to be working with such a committed group of individuals who still believe in our students' untapped potential.

128
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:41,555
There is an old expression that rings true for me, out of adversity comes opportunity.

129
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:53,300
The pandemic has changed us all and the Medford public schools have been able to capitalize on these unusual circumstances to strongly improve teaching and learning for all our students.

130
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,622
We are making the necessary adjustments in real time to meet the needs of our entire school community.

131
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:07,582
I thank you all in advance for your understanding and support during the second year of leading and learning in the Medford Public Schools.

132
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:14,466
I look forward to our continued collaboration to advance the Medford Public Schools to higher heights.

133
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:18,868
Thank you.

134
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,469
Thank you.

135
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:23,831
Thank you.

136
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:24,772
Is there any questions?

137
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:31,998
Member Russo.

138
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:33,579
Thank you.

139
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,241
Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

140
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:41,683
I appreciated this write-up.

141
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:49,587
I realize that the pandemic sort of threw quite the wrench in the process of completing your goals.

142
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:59,512
I thought the evaluation was fair, and I don't envy you having to try to write this up, considering what's been going on this last year.

143
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:02,069
couple of things.

144
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:30,052
First off, I did want to say that, you know, the goal of a focus on instruction, I felt like that's, you know, when I think back on the time that you've been here, if somebody was to just ask me, like, what's the biggest thing that's gone on since you've been here, and it's that focus on instruction has been, frankly, nonstop, and that I appreciate greatly, I'm sure.

145
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,011
the students, the teachers and families do as well.

146
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:40,896
I did want to just, there was one item on standard two management and operations.

147
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,738
I see that the CCSR initiatives are in there.

148
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:47,580
Actually they're in a couple of places and I think they belong there.

149
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:55,045
I just want to make sure that the CCSR as I understand it at this moment in time is not in our budget for a single nickel.

150
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,066
And I want to just

151
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:08,921
or just to consider that at budget season that we consider CCSR important enough that it's evidence for your review in two places or more.

152
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:22,769
And I think it's appropriate, but I also wanna just acknowledge that if the external funding source vanishes tomorrow, so does the CCSR unless we think it's important enough to budget.

153
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,771
So I'm happy to see that in there.

154
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:53,663
I just wanna urge you to consider seeing whether it needs to be in the budget this year, if that external source for funding will go away or not, which I realize it might be too soon to know that, but I do wonder about the Cummings Foundation and others who provide this funding, the impacts of the pandemic and the economy on them may impact their ability to provide those funds.

155
00:22:55,523 --> 00:23:00,672
And I also just, actually, that's all I have for the moment.

156
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,114
I'll let other people ask questions.

157
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:02,515
Thank you.

158
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:05,380
Thank you, Member Russo.

159
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,382
Member Kratz.

160
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,294
Hi, hi, thank you.

161
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:12,856
I don't have any questions.

162
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:20,903
I just wanted to say thank you to Dr. Edward Vincent for a very detailed self-evaluation.

163
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:26,669
And I couldn't be prouder to have her as our superintendent.

164
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,892
And I just wanted to let everybody know that.

165
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:35,016
And I didn't know, the question I do have actually is are we going to be doing

166
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:36,918
our evaluation tonight.

167
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,603
I didn't know I have something ready, but I didn't know if we were doing that tonight or if that's going to be another meeting.

168
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:53,351
Tonight you're doing my evaluation tonight.

169
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:59,536
We have not scheduled a school committee

170
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,802
a self-evaluation as of yet.

171
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:08,843
We have not scheduled that yet.

172
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:14,106
I know what we did in the past was each of us prepared.

173
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:24,851
I got a Word document ready with the same standards that you prepared and did a little write-up and then did a final comment in any final evaluation.

174
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,872
Are we going to just send those to you?

175
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:41,714
Or are we going to kind of go around the Zoom and ask, you know, what each of our, you know, like, let's say, grade was?

176
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:53,877
I know the last time we had it was in person, and we kind of went around the table, and everybody just, you know, we went through the standard, and everybody just, you know, kind of gave their evaluation grade.

177
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,440
I just didn't know how we were doing it this evening.

178
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:01,525
Like I said, I do have my evaluation ready.

179
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:07,051
I just didn't know how we're sharing it with everybody during this particular Zoom call.

180
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:21,774
I was thinking it would be probably similar to what you did last time where everyone kind of gave their feedback or ask specific questions.

181
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:30,420
And then you spoke with one another like across the table, even though I was there, it was kind of like, I was listening.

182
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:41,088
I kind of just became a silent listener as you school committee members had a conversation about the standards and whatever notes were sent

183
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:45,009
To me, we compiled them, and that's... Okay.

184
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:46,829
All right.

185
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:55,131
So, I mean, at this point, should I just give, like, I did an overall comment in my probation, you know, grading.

186
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:59,192
Should I do that at this time, or are we holding off till the end?

187
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:01,513
I just wasn't sure.

188
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:08,155
If I should go ahead and do that, and then have another committee member go ahead with their questions or comments.

189
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:09,935
Mayor, point of information, please.

190
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:11,989
of information, Member McLaughlin.

191
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:12,830
Thank you.

192
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,973
So as a new member, there hasn't really been a lot of orientation around this.

193
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:26,638
I would second Member Kretsch's concern or need for some clarification.

194
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:37,265
So can somebody lay out the process for us explicitly and for those who are on the call so that we do understand what the expectations are?

195
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,506
Thank you, Superintendent, for this

196
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,475
self-evaluation and for the thoroughness of it.

197
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,196
I appreciate that.

198
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:47,297
So I'm just wondering sort of if we could lay that out.

199
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:48,058
Sure.

200
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:54,864
I know member van de Kloet, maybe you could speak first and then member Graham has her hand up because you've been doing this for some years.

201
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:55,685
Member van de Kloet.

202
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:00,117
Yes, um, the thing is that it's changed, it's changed a great deal.

203
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:13,122
And I personally don't think that the committee has agreed on the next step and I think we need to that that's would be the focus of mean some uniform way of presenting.

204
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:19,086
So I had thought that the superintendent was going to present to us tonight.

205
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:29,196
I didn't know that the expectation was that we would be giving her feedback in writing tonight, at least, or whatever.

206
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,660
So I'd be interested in hearing what member Graham has to say.

207
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:34,461
Member Graham?

208
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,003
What her expectations were.

209
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:43,101
So I actually went and read the document that Kathy sent us back in December.

210
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:53,705
And on page 15, it actually gives like a handy set of like procedural steps and plans, how you approach superintendent evaluation.

211
00:27:55,366 --> 00:28:01,489
There should, I mean, in any evaluation, like we should not be verbally shooting from the hip.

212
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,830
We should be thoughtful and planful and,

213
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,675
I don't think there's enough time in the next 25 minutes to do that myself.

214
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:25,350
But this set of worksheet steps supports what I consider to be good, solid evaluation practices, which is to establish goals, which we have, which the prior committee did back in November.

215
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:39,801
And then it does talk about a formative mid-cycle assessment, which I don't recall us doing in that like, I'll say formal way, but it's not required, although it is recommended.

216
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:44,803
And then the superintendent provides an end of cycle report, which I feel like is what we just heard.

217
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:50,586
Step five is that we all receive an evaluation form.

218
00:28:51,486 --> 00:29:06,977
And the evaluation form has in it implicit the agreed upon goals and highlighted any agreed upon indicators and a copy of the rubric that is attached to this document so that we all are using level playing field.

219
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:24,491
And then what I think we need to do this evening is talk about the questions that they lay out in step five, which is who will compile, how will ratings be determined, how will ratings be presented, how will the narrative be composed, and what individual evaluations will be shared.

220
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:32,034
And then, you know, we all have a date by which we have to submit everything to somebody, whoever that somebody is.

221
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:39,137
Somebody creates a composite evaluation, and then we have a meeting where we discuss that.

222
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:44,199
Step eight is like final evaluation presented, discussed, and voted in a public meeting.

223
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,720
So that's the set of steps that they recommend.

224
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:58,425
that ensures our compliance with the open meeting law, which actually has gone to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as it relates to superintendent evaluation.

225
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:05,769
And it ensures that we're all sort of using the same measuring sticks and against the same goals.

226
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:17,135
So I don't personally see any reason to veer from this recommended process, but I think we should talk about like what those steps are and when we will complete them.

227
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:25,024
Thank you.

228
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:27,648
Member McLaughlin, then Member Van de Kloot.

229
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:34,315
Thank you for sharing that information, member Kratz from back in September.

230
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,595
So it's been a little while.

231
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,057
And thank you member Graham for reviewing it and sharing it with the rest of us.

232
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:58,663
I'd like to make a motion that we use this document to create a process of evaluation for our superintendent now and moving forward so that there's a system in place for evaluation and a rubric in place for evaluation for the future that we have both

233
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,785
for posterity and for this current practice.

234
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:02,945
Can I have a second?

235
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:04,346
Second.

236
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:09,409
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van de Kloot.

237
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,990
Member Graham?

238
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:19,976
Are you, Member McLaughlin, are you thinking this would go to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee to be memorialized as part of our policy handbook?

239
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,891
Ultimately, I would assume that it would need to go to the rules subcommittee to be part of the policy handbook.

240
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:40,095
But for now, I would like to see that we're using the guidance that was just shared that Kathy has shared that she can share with the rest of us to have a rubric that we're creating for this purpose and then

241
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:55,964
subsequent to this purpose, if we want to defer that to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee so that it is memorialized into our policy handbook, I think that that would be very helpful for future school committee members so that we have an established process in place.

242
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:04,390
So are you interested in amending your motion to include that?

243
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:05,951
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:06,812
Perfect.

245
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh, I need to call the roll.

246
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:17,546
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member van de Kloet, as amended by Member Graham.

247
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:18,427
Member Rousseau.

248
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,108
Thank you.

249
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:32,258
I obviously have no problem whatsoever with the motion on the floor, but that won't help us with this evaluation, if I understand it correctly.

250
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,161
So if we want to further clarify the motion, may I?

251
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:38,123
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

252
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:45,379
So if we want to further clarify the motion on the floor that, you know, we can break it down into specific steps, if that's helpful.

253
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:55,264
I remember Rousseau that we, the motion on the floor is that we are taking the rubric that has been, what is the organization that the document originated?

254
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:56,164
Is it the MASC?

255
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:56,885
Yes.

256
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:57,425
Okay.

257
00:32:57,865 --> 00:33:06,509
So that we are taking the MASC standards for superintendent evaluation and applying them to this current,

258
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:29,960
evaluation and that we will review that rubric and that information between now and the next meeting, right, and provide written feedback, each member, based on the rubric and reconvene at that time for the feedback.

259
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,982
So then to further the motion, the amendment to the motion,

260
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:52,474
That that would be the process added to the process as well moving forward as we go, you know, as a referred to the policy subcommittee where, you know, there will be that rubric in place, it will, the superintendent will present on one meeting.

261
00:33:53,614 --> 00:34:07,526
and then between that meeting and the subsequent meeting, the school committee members will have the opportunity to evaluate the superintendent's self-evaluation and respond to the rubric.

262
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,708
Is that sufficient, Member Russo?

263
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:14,511
It's a lot.

264
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:21,257
I mean, I know it's a lot and I just feel like, I mean, I'll vote for it because I

265
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,846
get the gist of what you're trying to say.

266
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:29,810
I'm just not clear how to know when the subcommittee has actually done the work.

267
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:38,916
The good news is, is you're on that subcommittee, so we don't have to really hash that out right now, I feel like, but thank you.

268
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:48,563
Beforehand, if I may, subcommittee will hash it out for the policies and procedures moving forward, but for this, where we're gonna review

269
00:34:49,984 --> 00:35:06,200
Somebody needs to compile everything before the 22nd of February so we can discuss it as a, I think you said a compiled ratings and determine the positive eval at another meeting, which we can do on the 22nd, which would be about a month.

270
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:19,212
I mean, member Graham, it will take that long to for us to provide the feedback and like more importantly for whoever's compiling this like it's really.

271
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:35,937
It's really tedious to do a good job of compiling information from seven different people into an evaluation that is cohesive and doesn't just sound like seven different streams of thought about things.

272
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,499
So I do think we all need to be,

273
00:35:40,679 --> 00:36:05,187
um quick in our you know as quick as reasonable in our own like individual feedback because then whoever is going to be the compiler of this information it's uh it's you know it's a decent amount of work to do it well and to have it come together like a single voice um in a way that is going to be meaningful feedback um to present.

274
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:06,607
I agree.

275
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:07,908
Member McLaughlin?

276
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:35,919
Mayor, as the secretary, I'm willing to do that if my colleagues are looking for somebody to incorporate the information and create a narrative that is a cohesive narrative that takes into consideration all of the different members with attribution, of course, and their feedback, and pulling together, assuming that the rubric, I have not looked at it, assuming that the rubric is

277
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:53,367
um, explanatory and certainly conferring with colleagues, although not, um, enough to require an open meeting, but, you know, conferring or asking questions if I have to, um, I'm happy to put something together based on information that is shared if that's helpful.

278
00:36:54,827 --> 00:36:55,528
Thank you very much.

279
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:59,349
Member McLaughlin, about how much time do you think you you need?

280
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:02,071
So we had it by the 8th to you.

281
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,732
Would the 22nd be a good time to

282
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:08,542
have another committee of the whole to regroup and discuss?

283
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,346
So when- Yes, that should be fine.

284
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:15,871
If we give ourselves a deadline of the eighth, then we'll have it ready for that.

285
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,433
Yes, that's fine, Mayor.

286
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:19,515
Okay.

287
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,040
We can add that to the motion.

288
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:32,276
So this extremely, oh, I'm supposed to be the one that's recording this motion too right now.

289
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:37,199
So I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to give this some thought, but to sort of distill it a little bit.

290
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:40,822
Yes, I will write some.

291
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,864
I'm sorry, guys, this is my first time having to do this.

292
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:45,526
it up.

293
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:57,152
So I think we get the gist of the motion, but to be explicit once again, the motion is that a rubric will be created with best practices, um, for evaluation of Superintendent Edward Vincent.

294
00:37:57,772 --> 00:38:09,939
Um, and each of the school committee members will apply that rubric to the self evaluation that, um, Dr Edward Vincent has sent us and give feedback to the secretary by, um,

295
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:21,876
February 8th, and we will respond to the superintendent self-evaluation in a public committee of the whole meeting on September 25th, did you say?

296
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,397
I mean, February 25th?

297
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,200
February, our meetings are February 22nd.

298
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:29,781
22nd, sorry.

299
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,004
So that's one part of the motion.

300
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,265
Point of information.

301
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,491
Member Van de Kloop, point of information.

302
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:44,915
Melanie, I think you said in your first sentence that a rubric will be created, but the rubric already exists.

303
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:48,557
It's just to create a template for us, right?

304
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:51,399
That's right.

305
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,219
Yeah.

306
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:53,119
Member Graham.

307
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,082
Would you like me to just type something out, Melanie?

308
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,443
Suzy doesn't have it already.

309
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,084
I'm sorry.

310
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:02,165
Or does Suzy have it?

311
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,086
Suzy, do you have it?

312
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:06,107
Or should we type something out?

313
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:13,848
I don't know if she records them now, if she watches the video after.

314
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,491
Susie, Ms.

315
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:18,053
Wise, sorry.

316
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:21,878
Oh, just going to unmute yourself.

317
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,299
Oh, she can't.

318
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:25,462
There you go.

319
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:36,342
I'm not sure if I have it, but I'm happy to create one from here and get it to you all.

320
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:38,262
I can.

321
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,563
So the most I think, excuse me, Mayor, may I?

322
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,744
Yes, Member McLaughlin, then Member Rousseau.

323
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,065
Yeah, I think that

324
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:50,295
you know, based on our discussion, if people want me to articulate it more, I want to take a moment for me to write it.

325
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,295
I'm fine with doing that.

326
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,157
Member Graham, thank you for the offer.

327
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:05,606
I think that we're getting the gist of the motion, but if people really need it spelled out right now, I can certainly take a moment to type it up and hopefully articulate it clearly in this motion.

328
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:14,452
But I can also articulate it again right now that we are, the motion is to create a procedure for evaluation of our superintendent that is

329
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:28,833
a current working procedure for the January 2021 evaluation that will be due on February 22nd back to the superintendent.

330
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:44,962
And then the addendum to that motion is that after February 22nd, the procedure will be, the recommended procedure will be moved to the policy subcommittee for review before being

331
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:52,712
memorialized in our pending policy handbook for 2021-2022.

332
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:55,713
And I have a second on the floor.

333
00:40:55,973 --> 00:41:01,014
Is that sufficient for folks to take a vote, or do you want me to type it up right now for everyone to see?

334
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:02,374
Mayor.

335
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:02,934
That's good.

336
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:04,455
Thank you very much.

337
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:05,435
Member Rousseau?

338
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:06,915
Thank you.

339
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:13,277
I was starting to have a flashback, I feel like it was in the movie The Matrix, as I

340
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:20,863
did a search, I realized that I actually took and put the entire rubric into a template for the school committee in June 24th, 2019.

341
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:24,626
And I just shared it in the chat.

342
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:37,376
This is the rubric based on the current evaluation system, which was new for 2019, which is why I took the effort to do that.

343
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:39,518
But we can

344
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:49,938
pull this out and put it into a procedures, of course, when we get to that in the subcommittee, so that it's not just tucked away in my personal Google Docs.

345
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,980
But I did share it with the members and actually anybody in the meeting.

346
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:07,908
So if you want to use that for your own submission to member McLaughlin, that will save her the trouble of figuring out how we all decided to type it up, because this is taken directly from the language of the

347
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,118
the new evaluation system.

348
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:11,742
Thank you.

349
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:18,538
And I just put in the chat a written form of what I think we've agreed to.

350
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,138
Thank you, Jenny.

351
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,259
You're faster typer than me.

352
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:22,259
I'm like trying to listen.

353
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:22,820
Typed it.

354
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,081
You know, thank you for doing that.

355
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:24,901
And thank you, member.

356
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:31,046
Um, so and so the rubric just point of information members.

357
00:42:31,086 --> 00:42:38,651
So the rubric that you shared in the Google Google Docs spreadsheet is from the M. A. S. C. Recommended rubric procedures.

358
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,632
Is that accurate?

359
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:44,755
No, that's from the, uh, Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.

360
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:45,756
I think that's the law.

361
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:47,117
I don't think that is

362
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:48,958
I don't think it's the law.

363
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:52,441
I think the law required the board to create this.

364
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,664
This is a set, this rubric is not optional.

365
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,667
The superintendent and MASC did not make this up.

366
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:06,553
These are the expected things that we should be evaluating the superintendent on.

367
00:43:06,814 --> 00:43:11,778
And it may seem like a crazy list until you look at what was there before.

368
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,900
And then you realize this is,

369
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:19,769
Heaven sent, the one before was pages and pages of questions for which you could never know the answers.

370
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:34,585
So yeah, this is, we don't have to create it because I don't think we have the option to create it, but incorporating it into a whole narrative of our procedures for the school committee, I think is key and definitely what we should talk about in the subcommittee.

371
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes, and in the interim, Mayor, I will do that for our evaluation due back to the superintendent on February 22nd.

372
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,761
So there's a motion on the floor.

373
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:46,742
Thank you, Member Graham.

374
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:57,049
For the purpose of evaluation of the 2019-2020 school year, the committee secretary will compile a template for school committee members to use to provide feedback in compliance with the MASC evaluation process.

375
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:00,971
The committee will respond to the secretary in writing by February 8th.

376
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:04,834
The compile evaluation will be the subject of a meeting on February 22nd.

377
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:13,619
In addition, the rules policy and equity subcommittee will establish a standing policy and timeline to govern the superintendent evaluation process in subsequent years.

378
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,921
And I have a second from member Gretz.

379
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:17,402
Correct.

380
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:18,342
Roll call.

381
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:21,844
Member Graham.

382
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:22,545
Yes.

383
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:24,360
Member Kretz?

384
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,300
Yes.

385
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:27,202
Member McLaughlin?

386
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:27,502
Yes.

387
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:31,526
Member Muson?

388
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:32,166
Yes.

389
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:33,607
Member Rousseau?

390
00:44:34,168 --> 00:44:34,368
Yes.

391
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:36,210
Member Van de Kloot?

392
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,770
Yes.

393
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,852
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

394
00:44:39,072 --> 00:44:41,875
Yes.

395
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:44,597
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

396
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:46,318
The motion passes.

397
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:48,120
Member Van de Kloot?

398
00:44:49,357 --> 00:45:09,608
Notwithstanding all of that and the process, I think that it's only appropriate, though, and Kathy made some comments, and I know we don't want to go into large comments, so I'm just going to say this has been an extraordinarily challenging year, and I think that the superintendent has risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.

399
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,570
Thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

400
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,350
Member McLaughlin?

401
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,791
I know that we have 10 minutes left of this meeting.

402
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:24,354
And I also just wanted to say to Dr. Edward that Medford has been very fortunate to have you this past year.

403
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,655
And we've all been through something remarkable together.

404
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:37,880
And certainly who would have known on a first term that I'd be ending up in a situation with all of you in a global pandemic, but I can't imagine a superintendent that I would rather be in that situation with.

405
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,803
So it's been a pleasure getting to know you and seeing you work through some very difficult times.

406
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:43,583
So thank you.

407
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:55,271
Great.

408
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:57,253
Okay.

409
00:45:59,154 --> 00:45:59,855
Thank you, everybody.

410
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:01,196
Is there a motion to adjourn?

411
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,999
Motion to adjourn.

412
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:07,662
By Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau.

413
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:08,322
Roll call.

414
00:46:09,744 --> 00:46:10,364
Member Graham.

415
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:14,067
Yes.

416
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:16,309
Member Kretz.

417
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,390
Yes.

418
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:19,792
Member McLaughlin, yes.

419
00:46:19,832 --> 00:46:20,553
Member McStone.

420
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:21,013
Yes.

421
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:22,635
Member Rousseau.

422
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:23,529
Yes.

423
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,851
Member Van de Kloot?

424
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:25,372
Yes.

425
00:46:26,573 --> 00:46:27,474
Mayor Longo-Khan?

426
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,877
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative.

427
00:46:30,398 --> 00:46:31,279
The meeting's adjourned.

428
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:38,488
If we could also, before you, Hank, log off, the master calendar did not have this link or the 6 p.m.

429
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:40,010
link on the school site.

430
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,173
So if somebody could send that link around to us.

431
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:43,555
I'm not able to locate it.

432
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:43,995
I don't know.

433
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,517
Madam Mayor, I just sent it.

434
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:46,238
Thank you.

435
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:47,279
Okay.

436
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:49,522
We'll see you in a few minutes.

437
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:49,903
Thank you.
