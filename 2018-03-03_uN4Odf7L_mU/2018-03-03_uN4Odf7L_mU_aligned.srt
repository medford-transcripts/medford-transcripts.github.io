00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:25,462
It is December 1933, and America is in the middle of the Great Depression.

10
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:34,705
On the lower east side of New York, an orphanage has been the draft home of 11-year-old Annie for all but the first two months of her life.

11
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:34,925
Annie!

12
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,025
Annie!

13
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:47,888
Go back to sleep, Molly.

14
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:48,288
Shut up.

15
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,048
Now leave her alone.

16
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:54,127
Bonnie, sit down.

17
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,449
Oh my goodness, they're fighting again.

18
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:01,333
How are we ever going to get any sleep?

19
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:06,397
Everyone, be quiet.

20
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,358
It's all right, Molly.

21
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,019
Annie's here.

22
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,861
Annie, read me the note again, please.

23
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:15,764
Oh no, not the note again.

24
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,084
Please take care of our little doll.

25
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,246
Her name is Annie.

26
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:37,337
We have left half a silver locket around her neck so that when we come back for her, she will know that she's our baby.

27
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:41,801
Baby far away, oh baby.

28
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,971
made me in a house over by a hill.

29
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:55,415
She took my Indiana into the pale of hill.

30
00:04:55,435 --> 00:05:07,501
Back to the young, back to the smart, back to the cool and things like that and that and that.

31
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,342
Why shouldn't they be?

32
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,362
They'll all mistake what's given of me.

33
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:14,483
So maybe now it's time.

34
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,563
And maybe when I wake, they'll be there for me.

35
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,004
Baby, baby.

36
00:05:40,987 --> 00:06:04,950
♪ Maybe she's making a plot that looks ♪ ♪ Maybe there's a trick that's written on the line ♪ ♪ Don't really care as long as they're mine ♪ ♪ So maybe now it's red, the last one of its kind ♪

37
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:28,542
Oh my goodness, she's running away.

38
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:37,704
Shhh, Tessie, I have to see you going, you little brat.

Thank you very much.

187
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:04,518
Thank you very much.

188
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,019
Thank you very much.

189
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,880
Thank you very much.

190
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,621
Thank you very much.

191
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:08,241
Thank you very much.

192
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:09,202
Thank you very much.

193
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:09,642
Thank you very much.

194

Thank you very much.

195
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,684
Thank you very much.

196
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,424
Thank you very much.

197
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:13,045
Thank you very much.

198
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,325
Thank you very much.

199
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:14,826
Thank you very much.

200
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:15,506
Thank you very much.

201
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:15,987
Thank you very much.

202
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:16,427
Thank you very much.

We're off to you with admiration.

213

Come down to Herb and Mrs. Toot.

Come down here to Christmas then.

217
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:44,985
Be sure to bring your Mrs. Toot.

218
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:52,527
We ain't got any chicken for our stuffing.

219
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,308
Why don't we just stomp you?

220
00:17:54,448 --> 00:18:00,290
If you're ever in a mood for a party, we'll show you just the way.

221
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,751
You've already had you.

222
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:09,554
You're a friend, you've made us what we are, too.

223
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:41,897
Come on, move on, let's get out of here, run!

224
00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:05,628
Little girls, little girls, everywhere I turn I can see them.

225
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:12,131
Little girls, little girls, night and day I mean they can't bring them.

226
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:20,714
Look what a beautiful winter it is.

227
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,915
Come on, come on and drift with her.

228
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,857
Lucky me, lucky me.

229
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:29,101
Look at what a friend I've been to.

230
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,004
Someday I'll step on that crackle.

231
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:38,329
One night I'll scrape that curl.

232
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:54,074
You don't want to say no to anything that I know you can do to the little girl.

233
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:59,437
If that girl doesn't come back here real soon, I'll be in real trouble.

234
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,079
Annie's back!

235
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,602
Annie's back!

236
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:30,569
This better not happen again or I'll report you.

237
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:33,071
I'm here on behalf of all of the world.

238
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:36,593
All of the warlocks, the millionaires?

239
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,574
No, the billionaires.

240
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,675
Eight, nine,

241
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,029
Dad?

242
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:45,130
We have lots of little girls around that age.

243
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,610
And someone smart?

244
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,451
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

245
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,891
What about her?

246
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,211
Annie?

247
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,252
No, you can't have her.

248
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:59,132
I'm what you give up for having Dad.

249
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,773
Annie, get your coat.

250
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,573
Annie doesn't have a coat.

251
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:05,834
We'll have to get a nice new one.

252
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:08,334
These are my things.

253
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:28,306
There goes Annie, we'll miss you.

254
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:34,932
Annie and Grace arrive at Mr. Warbeck's mansion where all the servants are busy cleaning.

255
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:39,736
Annie is delighted to learn that as a guest she won't have to do any cleaning.

256
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,254
Good evening, miss.

257
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,015
Wow, what a place!

258
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:57,456
May I take your coat?

259
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:58,416
Will I, Captain Man?

260
00:21:59,557 --> 00:21:59,837
It's okay.

261
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:00,277
It's okay, Danny.

262
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:00,778
We'll give it back.

263
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,179
Okay, what would you want?

264
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,220
What do you want to do first?

265
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,702
Well, I'll start with the windows, and then get to the floor.

266
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:09,923
You don't have to do any work.

267
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:14,486
You can go on vacation.

268
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:21,051
In the field we'll lay out all your clothes.

269
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:21,251
Blue?

270
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:26,456
No, red I think.

271
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,979
We'll balance on my Mrs. Rear.

272
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,780
Gloves?

273
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:34,243
No, I won't let you.

274
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:36,305
Then come sit you in your bed.

275
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:36,765
Bill?

276
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,827
No, bag machine.

277
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:46,579
I think I'm gonna like it here.

278
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:48,520
The pool is to the left.

279
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,700
Inside the house?

280
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
Uh-huh.

281
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,522
The trash is put in the rear.

282
00:22:57,802 --> 00:22:59,722
I'm gonna pick up a racket.

283
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:01,603
The instructor's here at you.

284
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:10,134
I think I'm gonna like it here.

285
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,415
I used to grow in a tomb where I sit and read.

286
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:11,935
Get me that holy cow.

287
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:12,995
Could someone pinch me, please?

288
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:37,287
You've never had a little girl.

289
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:38,547
I'm very glad you're all here.

290
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:40,488
We hope you understand.

291
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,449
Your wishes are command.

292
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:44,210
I know what's gonna get here.

293
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:29,360
Hello, everyone.

294
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,527
Good to be home as this business trip was very demanding.

295
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:33,690
Dismissed.

296
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,220
Not you.

297
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:37,421
Not you?

298
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:38,241
Who is this?

299
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:39,902
This is the orphan you want.

300
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:41,623
I was expecting a boy.

301
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,764
Why, I've already purchased balls and a bat.

302
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,085
You just say what kind of orphan.

303
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,626
I'll throw them out.

304
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:49,027
Oh, well, we'll have to make the best of it.

305
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:50,508
What do you want to do?

306
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:51,349
Want to go to the movies?

307
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:54,610
I've never been to the movies before.

308
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:54,950
Oh, good.

309
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:55,491
Great.

310
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:56,111
You take her.

311
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,092
Thank you.

312
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:57,972
What's the matter?

313
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,553
I thought you were going to take me.

314
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:01,174
Oh, all right.

315
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:01,814
We'll all go together.

316
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:03,315
Drake, get our coats.

317
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:06,271
Shall I have a car paged for you?

318
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,012
No, we'll walk.

319
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,695
It's only 45 blocks to Times Square.

320
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:32,761
I'll be playing your Grace Brown Returns to the Orphanage.

321
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:37,045
Oh, it's you again.

322
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:40,408
What do you want?

323
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:44,071
Mr. Robux is a very famous man who would like to adopt her.

324
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:48,375
Would you excuse me for a minute?

325
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:48,455
Ah!

326
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:50,036
Anne is getting adopted by a millionaire!

327
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,828
Hi, gorgeous.

328
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:11,668
Rooster?

329
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,009
Who's that?

330
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,470
This is Lily St.

331
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:14,931
Regis.

332
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,272
Boy, isn't he daft to move to you?

333
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,053
Shut up, you dumb old cow.

334
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:22,075
Can you owe me 500 bucks?

335
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:26,578
Last time I owned you any money, I never started.

336
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:34,163
Well, I'll spring for some money this time, but never again.

337
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:43,259
We pass through the way of hate and monster.

338
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,922
Who's in, who's out, who's full of the mind?

339
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,325
Chasing in and out of places like no other.

340
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:48,447
You gotta get there.

341
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,731
before you die.

342
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:59,176
You don't get to ever play it from the floor, but I gently ace it a load of times.

343
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:01,719
Mother dear, oh, I know you're down there listening.

344
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,221
You've got a problem with me and I.

345
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,351
Is this real?

346
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:14,872
Is this real?

347
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:15,752
Where has winter been?

348
00:27:15,772 --> 00:27:16,713
Can you see the leaves?

349
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:17,113
Is this real?

350
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:17,873
How can this be?

351
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,373
I'm a proud black Korean champion.

352
00:27:57,204 --> 00:27:59,266
Andy, sit down.

353
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,747
I want to tell you something.

354
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,468
But first, you'd better sit down.

355
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,069
I can't sit here.

356
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,871
Well, maybe I had better sit down.

357
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,672
Here, I want to give you this.

358
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:08,593
It's a locket.

359
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:10,474
I always noticed that old one you wear.

360
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:15,098
No, the only thing I have to remember my parents had is this locket.

361
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:22,304
The only thing I want more than anything else in the whole world is to find my parents.

362
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:22,884
I promise.

363
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:36,783
I promise you, Amy, that we will do everything possible to find your parents.

364
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:42,067
If I should need the FBI Then I will have the FBI

365
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:58,082
With all the favors that I've done J.F.R.

366
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:16,577
Hoover owes me one And then the midnight oil gets burned Till not a stone is left unturned I will search everywhere And I'll find them, I swear Oh, you won't be an orphan for long

367
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,451
If I should need U.S.

368
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,213
Marines, then I could have U.S.

369
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:29,137
Marines, without the order of the Lord.

370
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:34,682
They'll be included in my throne, and other men would call it quits.

371
00:29:51,235 --> 00:30:04,488
Annie, do you have anything else that will help us find your parents?

372
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:06,069
Can you use my note too?

373
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:10,133
Okay Annie, go work on it.

374
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:37,217
A Rockefeller Center-on-the-radio program called the Oxygen Hour is found very daily.

375
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:49,231
Warbucks offers a reward for anyone who can prove that they are any parent.

376
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:12,600
Maybe far away, or maybe we're nearby.

377
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,360
Maybe.

378
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:25,395
Maybe in a house, or in my eyes.

379
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,757
She may be me, and I'll be her.

380
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:47,883
Vegetative, why shouldn't we be?

381
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:55,706
We're both the same, what's giving up me?

382
00:31:56,066 --> 00:32:05,630
So maybe now is time, and maybe when I leave,

383
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:32,303
Ladies and gentlemen, we have another special treat for you.

384
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:34,754
all of the reward bucks himself.

385
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:44,177
Yes, even I lost those two things.

386
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:56,501
Now I'd like to announce that I am offering a certified check for $50,000 to anyone who can prove they are any fair.

387
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,762
And now we present the Boiler Sisters.

388
00:32:58,802 --> 00:32:59,202

390
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:27,940
They're wearing army jeans and pillows.

391
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,900
It's what you wear for me each year.

392
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,920
And I promise you, don't laugh at me.

393
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:30,941
So sad and slow, she enters the wonderful world.

394

Guess what they're wearing on Main Street's Elm Hill Road.

396
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:26,520
It's what you wear every year.

397
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:34,604
And I promise you, so that matters no, matters no, matters no.

398
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:41,927
Long for a while, remember you're never fully dressed, through you may wear

00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:51,403
♪ You'll never believe it without a smile ♪ Wow, eating on the radio!

400
00:34:51,443 --> 00:35:11,557
I would just love to be on the radio!

401

What's so good about that?

402
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:22,569
Now, with our smiles, this bird here will sing.

403
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:27,695
Now, with our smiles, this bird here will sing.

404
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:45,205
Ladies and gentlemen, Ms.

405
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:51,651
Hannigan has a pair of collars at the orchard.

406
00:35:51,811 --> 00:36:00,538
Ralph and Shirley and Bunch, a couple from Canada, claim to be Annie's parents.

407
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,256
Who are you?

408
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,957
We're Ralph and Sheryl Mudge.

409
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:22,319
We understand you are our aunt.

410
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:23,420
Your aunt, Karen?

411
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:27,083
We have been barred and we must take her home with us.

412
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:28,784
We have cows, pigs, and goats.

413
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,461
and Roosters.

414
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:32,221
Roosters!

415
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:35,623
Okay, but it's got to be at a quest.

416
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:37,644
Hey, don't forget me.

417
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:43,126
You should have a Rooster out to give you any information.

418
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:52,710
Okay, okay, lady, but I don't know why you're being so tough.

419
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:58,393
You're simple, and I don't believe this is happening.

420
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,308
Now don't forget, he doesn't have the locket.

421
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:02,129
What locket?

422
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,409
They didn't mention anything about a locket or anything.

423
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:06,969
I didn't tell you.

424
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:12,770
When Edie left her padlock, they left her with a hat so she could lock it around her neck.

425
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,051
Edie snapped at both.

426
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:20,092
Okay, I know a guy who can make the other half of a cheap boat.

427
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,692
Okay guys, I'll leave this in your hands.

428
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:25,693
But what are we going to do with that little brat we get?

429
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:26,973
I'll handle that.

430
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:33,415
When you're chasing after good things, ask for a lullaby.

431
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,897
Keep the kids in a place like no other.

432
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,719
You've got to get there before you die.

433
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:58,150
You don't get there by playing how your rules work.

434
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,312
You're scared of the exits.

435
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,095
You're bold to die.

436
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,997
You want to be your own.

437
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:10,360
I know you can't be elicited.

438
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,282
You're gonna wobble if you see that my tears bleed.

439
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:13,643
It's free.

440
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:14,103
It's free.

441
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:15,304
It's free to live.

442
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:30,077
May the coming of days bring peace and strength, better and dearer.

443
00:38:46,862 --> 00:39:03,666
In Washington, D.C., at the White House, President Roosevelt and his cabinet reflect the national gloom as they listen to a radio broadcast against FDR.

444
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,966
Well, gentlemen, we have high time

445
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,719
and we are in a deep depression.

446
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:20,399
Maybe we can create some new jobs.

447
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:24,780
Yes, things are really tough and we have lots of work to do.

448
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:40,584
Mr. President and everyone, I would like you to meet my newest addition, Annie.

449
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:45,005
She's been outside while we have been doing business together.

450
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,531
She can stay in here.

451
00:39:52,412 --> 00:39:53,452
Can I say something?

452
00:39:53,932 --> 00:40:02,195
I know things are bad, but maybe... The sun will come out tomorrow.

453
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:05,296
Sit down, little girl.

454
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:44,062

456
00:40:53,936 --> 00:41:04,465
Tomorrow, you're always mine.

457
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,751
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya.

458
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:18,693
Tomorrow, you're always a day away.

459
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:35,138
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. President, but a telegram from New York has just arrived from Mr. Wood.

460
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,528
Come for me.

461
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:43,831
Hundreds of couples are here claiming to be Annie's parents.

462
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:46,072
You'll have to excuse us.

463
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:55,837
Annie, we'll have to get back to New York as soon as possible.

464
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:10,447
Okay.

465
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:52,854
Where is everyone?

466
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:56,796
I'm sorry, Annie.

467
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:01,378
No one knows about the locket.

468
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:06,961
None of them were really your parents.

469
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,542
Don't worry, Annie.

470
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:11,223
We'll keep trying.

471
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:14,344
But in the meantime, we'll look after you.

472
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:18,066
In fact, I would like to adopt you as my very own little girl.

473
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:45,845
Together in the blast Together forever We're time-alike They never can sever And I don't need sunshine now to turn my skies to blue I don't need anything from you You wrap me around

474
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,343
That cute little finger.

475
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:52,263
You played us a song.

476
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:55,166
You made me the singer.

477
00:43:55,326 --> 00:44:01,491
And once the bells went to you, always bubblegum.

478
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,563
I don't need anything but you.

479
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,464
Catacombs in the rain, dear, they won't be long.

480
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:14,368
Towers in the plain, dear, with you, I've got it all.

481
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:16,369
You're far from someone else.

482
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:28,397
I'm richer than goddess, but nothing on earth.

483
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:32,558
could ever define us.

484
00:44:32,698 --> 00:44:39,742
And if tomorrow I'm an apple seller too, I don't need anything.

485
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,423
I don't need anything.

486
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:44,085
I don't need anything but you.

487
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:11,733

497
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,181
They claim to be his parents.

498
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:01,182
Oh, my baby!

499
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:05,766
Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, do you have any proof that you are really in his parents?

500
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:08,628
Here, Mr. Wilberforce, is the birth certificate.

501
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:10,410
That's not enough.

502
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,733
Here, then, is the silver locket with the 3D of the orphanage.

503
00:47:15,534 --> 00:47:16,755
Oh, the silver locket?

504
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:17,896
Let me see it.

505
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,558
Oh, you really must be Annie's parents.

506
00:47:23,058 --> 00:47:27,622
Come back tomorrow as we are having a party for Annie here tonight.

507
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:30,124
Would you like to stay?

508
00:47:30,564 --> 00:47:43,074
No, we really must be going, but we'll be back to figure out tomorrow.

509
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,435
I know I've seen that place before.

510
00:47:44,455 --> 00:47:45,976
I think I saw them at the orphanage.

511
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:48,558
Mr. Wolbach, there's something phony about the lighting.

512
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:56,596
President Roosevelt, I have helped you out many times before.

513
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,344
Can you please do me a favor?

514
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:01,526
Get me a phone.

515
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:29,903
It's Christmas morning, 1933, in the Warbuck's Mansion.

516
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:41,101
Warbuck's police and FDR have been up all night in constant telephone contact with the FDR, and they now have unhappy news for Annie.

517
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:25,064
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill She's sitting playing piano

518
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:29,237
He didn't make a bill.

519
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:33,881
Betcha they're young, betcha they're smart.

520
00:49:33,981 --> 00:49:38,405
Bet they collect things like asteroids and ice.

521
00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:45,010
Betcha they're good, why shouldn't they be?

522
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:51,376
Their poor mistake was giving up me.

523
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:54,398
So maybe now is time.

524
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,260
When I wake, there'll be them calling me baby, baby.

525
00:50:31,012 --> 00:50:36,834
Annie, we have sad news.

526
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:44,556
We have found out that your mother and father have died many years ago.

527
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,437
Well, then who knew about the locket?

528
00:51:01,736 --> 00:51:03,337
Kids!

529
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:04,498
Annie!

530
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:14,464
Miss Hannigan, this is President Roosevelt.

531
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:22,889
Kids, we have presents for everyone!

532
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:23,469
Yay!

533
00:51:35,018 --> 00:51:36,119
Oh, my baby!

534
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:38,161
We've missed you so very much.

535
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,042
Hi, Mom.

536
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:39,823
Hi, Dad.

537
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:42,085
I suppose you would like the reward money?

538
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:48,131
We didn't know anything about the reward money, but that would be enough to bring up tomorrow evening.

539
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:51,675
Shall I make the check out to you?

540
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:52,095
Yeah.

541
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:53,817
Just sign it and we'll be on our way.

542
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,401
You guys are imposters.

543
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:08,526
You're under arrest for posing as Annie's parents.

544
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:19,815
I never liked you anyway, Annie, you little brat.

545
00:52:19,955 --> 00:52:25,239
From now on, no more money, yes?

546
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:29,452
Yay!

547
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:38,535
No more hard knock life.

548
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:38,755
Yay!

549
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:46,018
We'll all go to school.

550
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:46,178
Yay?

551
00:52:46,278 --> 00:52:50,719
Annie, what do you have a surprise for me?

552
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:51,139
A car.

553
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:27,609
We hope you enjoyed our performance of Annie.

554
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:46,204
Grade two and grade four.

555
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:49,346
Grade three, I promoted myself.

556
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:56,889
Grade two and grade three were very hot under some very warm conditions this week, and they were excellent.

557
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:00,370
We're about ready now to get everybody up for the applause.

558
00:54:08,674 --> 00:54:11,975
Our hobos, police, and laundry men,

559
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:41,075
Our servants, the Boylan sisters, our cabinet ministers, and President Roosevelt himself.

560
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:17,829
Lily, Brewster, and Grace.

561
00:55:31,727 --> 00:55:33,309
Our two Oliver Wolbachs.

562
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:48,274
Our Miss Hannigan's.

563
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,010
And our Annie's.

564
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,904
in our second grade chorus.

565
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:44,469
When it's not a birthday, that's great and lonely.

566
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:07,321
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya.

567
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:15,788
Tomorrow, you're always a day away.

568
00:57:15,868 --> 00:57:22,193
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya.

569
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:28,178
Tomorrow, you're always a day away.

570
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,144
We're gonna, like, give out flowers now to the, uh, mothers.

571
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:29,181
First, Mrs. Wallman.

572
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:29,782
Mrs. Swanson.

573
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,521
Mrs. Yeager.

574
00:59:00,031 --> 00:59:00,652
And Denise Dobson.

575
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:55,060
And the second grade class.

576
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:11,079
And thank you for coming.

577
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:30,449
Please join us for refreshments at the foyer.

578
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:39,176
Maybe in a house over by a hill, she'd sit and play in the air now, instead of paying the bill.

579
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:41,498
Back to day now, back to last night,

580
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:54,231
Back to their good, why shouldn't they be?

581
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:59,835
Their one mistake was givin' up me.

582
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:10,422
So maybe now it's time, for maybe when I wake, they'll be there callin' me baby.

583
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,620
Maybe that's what love looks.

584
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,981
Maybe they're strict and strict on time.

585
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:40,564
Don't really care as long as they're mine.

586
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:48,067
So maybe now he's friends, the last one of his kind.

587
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,828
Won't you please come and join them?
