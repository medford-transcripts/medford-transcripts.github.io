It is December 1933, and America is in the middle of the Great Depression. On the lower east side of New York, an orphanage has been the draft home of 11-year-old Annie for all but the first two months of her life. Annie! Annie! Go back to sleep, Molly. Shut up. Now leave her alone.

00:03:49,784 --> 00:04:16,885
Bonnie, sit down. Oh my goodness, they're fighting again. How are we ever going to get any sleep? Everyone, be quiet. It's all right, Molly. Annie's here. Annie, read me the note again, please. Oh no, not the note again.

10
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:43,362
Please take care of our little doll. Her name is Annie. We have left half a silver locket around her neck so that when we come back for her, she will know that she's our baby. Baby far away, oh baby.

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:30,078
I don't need anything but you. Catacombs in the rain, dear, they won't be long. Towers in the plain, dear, with you, I've got it all. You're far from someone else. I'm richer than goddess, but nothing on earth.

97
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:52,690
could ever define us. And if tomorrow I'm an apple seller too, I don't need anything. I don't need anything. I don't need anything but you.

98
00:45:07,912 --> 00:45:32,279

Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, do you see them? They claim to be his parents. Oh, my baby! Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, do you have any proof that you are really in his parents? Here, Mr. Wilberforce, is the birth certificate. That's not enough. Here, then, is the silver locket with the 3D of the orphanage. Oh, the silver locket? Let me see it.

103
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:48,798
Oh, you really must be Annie's parents. Come back tomorrow as we are having a party for Annie here tonight. Would you like to stay? No, we really must be going, but we'll be back to figure out tomorrow. I know I've seen that place before. I think I saw them at the orphanage. Mr. Wolbach, there's something phony about the lighting.

104
00:47:49,102 --> 00:48:01,606
President Roosevelt, I have helped you out many times before. Can you please do me a favor? Get me a phone.

105
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:41,802
It's Christmas morning, 1933, in the Warbuck's Mansion. Warbuck's police and FDR have been up all night in constant telephone contact with the FDR, and they now have unhappy news for Annie.

106
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:26,285
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill She's sitting playing piano

107
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:54,398
He didn't make a bill. Betcha they're young, betcha they're smart. Bet they collect things like asteroids and ice. Betcha they're good, why shouldn't they be? Their poor mistake was giving up me. So maybe now is time.

108
00:49:56,558 --> 00:50:08,152
When I wake, there'll be them calling me baby, baby.

109
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:47,757
Annie, we have sad news. We have found out that your mother and father have died many years ago. Well, then who knew about the locket?

110
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:24,410
Kids! Annie! Miss Hannigan, this is President Roosevelt. Kids, we have presents for everyone! Yay!

111
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:54,177
Oh, my baby! We've missed you so very much. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. I suppose you would like the reward money? We didn't know anything about the reward money, but that would be enough to bring up tomorrow evening. Shall I make the check out to you? Yeah. Just sign it and we'll be on our way.

112
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:25,379
You guys are imposters. You're under arrest for posing as Annie's parents. I never liked you anyway, Annie, you little brat. From now on, no more money, yes?

113
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:52,700
Yay! No more hard knock life. Yay! We'll all go to school. Yay? Annie, what do you have a surprise for me? A car.

114
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:46,784
We hope you enjoyed our performance of Annie. Grade two and grade four.

115
00:53:47,105 --> 00:54:12,215
Grade three, I promoted myself. Grade two and grade three were very hot under some very warm conditions this week, and they were excellent. We're about ready now to get everybody up for the applause. Our hobos, police, and laundry men,

116
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:41,577
Our servants, the Boylan sisters, our cabinet ministers, and President Roosevelt himself.

117
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:33,569
Lily, Brewster, and Grace. Our two Oliver Wolbachs.

118
00:55:47,153 --> 00:56:03,050
Our Miss Hannigan's. And our Annie's.

119
00:56:14,828 --> 00:56:17,630
in our second grade chorus.

120
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:54,316
When it's not a birthday, that's great and lonely.

121
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:28,859
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya. Tomorrow, you're always a day away. Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya. Tomorrow, you're always a day away.

122
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:30,082
We're gonna, like, give out flowers now to the, uh, mothers. First, Mrs. Wallman. Mrs. Swanson.

123
00:58:44,780 --> 00:59:01,132
Mrs. Yeager. And Denise Dobson.

124
00:59:52,297 --> 01:00:12,361
And the second grade class. And thank you for coming.

125
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:49,925
Please join us for refreshments at the foyer. Maybe in a house over by a hill, she'd sit and play in the air now, instead of paying the bill. Back to day now, back to last night,

126
01:00:50,228 --> 01:01:17,127
Back to their good, why shouldn't they be? Their one mistake was givin' up me. So maybe now it's time, for maybe when I wake, they'll be there callin' me baby.

127
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:51,468
Maybe that's what love looks. Maybe they're strict and strict on time. Don't really care as long as they're mine. So maybe now he's friends, the last one of his kind. Won't you please come and join them?
