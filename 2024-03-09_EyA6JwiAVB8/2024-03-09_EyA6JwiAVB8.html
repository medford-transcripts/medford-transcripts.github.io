    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=342.452s">Good</a>  evening, friends and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=344.955s">My</a>  name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=351.402s">Welcome</a>  to another live edition of First Friday's Words and Music, or as we call it when we're not on the first Friday, Flex Friday's Words and Music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=363.894s">We're</a>  happy to be following up a great Black History Month program with another special offering in celebration of women's history across the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=374.517s">Thanks</a>  to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are ready to roll again at 111 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=384.64s">As</a>  ever, I want to remind you that COVID is still a thing, and we're still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=393.087s">So</a>  masking is welcomed, but not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=396.31s">We're</a>  just happy to be sponsoring live programming here at WMCC and glad to see our neighbors, our friends and supporters coming through the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=405.759s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=408.513s">Thanks</a>  also to Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media channels nine for Comcast and 47 for Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=420.446s">If</a>  you're out there watching on your electronic devices, your 60 inch screens, whatever it might be, welcome to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=431.127s">So</a>  in my travels as a poet and as an ambassador for the arts, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=446.639s">Words</a>  and music has given me that opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=452.743s">Tonight</a>  is no exception, so I hope you're ready for something really special. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=458.147s">Our</a>  guest for this portion of the evening's program is my friend and a woman who can truly be considered a history maker. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=466.546s">Let</a>  me tell you a bit about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=469.144s">Dr.</a>  Sheila E. Nutt, two Ts, is a Newton resident and a former director of educational outreach programs for Harvard Medical School's Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=483.348s">My</a>  wife, Teresa, worked with her for a number of years, and we met through that relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=489.509s">Our</a>  paths crossed on a regular basis as I volunteered annually for a community-based student engagement event called Reflection in Action, a program that examined health disparities in the inner city and brought together students for greater agency and understanding in combating these inequities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=512.248s">That</a>  program, in and of itself, could certainly be considered history-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=517.531s">And</a>  yet, Dr. Sheila, as she has been known affectionately by closest and dearest, made history long before her tenure at Harvard, a tenure which she retired from several years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=530.478s">So</a>  in 1970, Sheila Nutt became one of the first African-American flight attendants working for Pan American World Airways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=542.067s">Over</a>  50 years have passed since Sheila helped make that history. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=548.192s">She</a>  was part of the first wave of African-American women hired as stewardesses, as they were called back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=557.074s">A</a>  half century ago, flight crews were mainly white, as were the passengers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=563.54s">After</a>  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, airlines had to start hiring people of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=571.327s">In</a>  1969, when Dr. Sheila was 20 years old and living in Philadelphia, she heard Pan Am was hiring and wanted in. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=580.775s">Let's</a>  explore that history with Sheila, but make sure your tray tables are locked and your seats are in the upright position. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=587.561s">Oh,</a>  and there might be some turbulence ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=591.761s">So</a>  as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a piece of verse that I shared with Dr. Sheila several years ago when she was doing some work on her program involving her colleagues and her history with PNM. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=612.045s">And</a>  that piece of poetry is called Song of the Blackbirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=622.782s">We</a>  are called the Blackbirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=625.083s">It</a>  has a ring that speaks to our natural woman thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=629.646s">Pin</a>  M said yes and got the best as chocolate doves embraced the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=636.209s">Not</a>  willowy blondes or buxom brunettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=639.911s">We</a>  Blackbirds flew beyond regrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=642.532s">We</a>  filled those uniforms just as well and answered that lofty airborne bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=648.356s">To</a>  serve with dignity and distinction, service like this is close to extinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=655.52s">35,000</a>  feet in the air, we were a flight crew beyond compare, telling the nations we weren't just white. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=662.164s">Through</a>  work and worth, we all took flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=665.606s">Ebony,</a>  tan, and caramel sweet, lovely sisters. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=670.149s">whole</a>  and complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=671.87s">Though</a>  attitude might be detected, we made our flyers feel safe and respected, rising above the scorn and disdain, striving to make our excellence plain. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=682.414s">Only</a>  the well-to-do flew with us, and rich folks really make a fuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=687.336s">We</a>  had to be humble right from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=689.257s">We</a>  had to be pretty, resourceful, and smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=691.759s">Like</a>  nurses, we treated our patients well, even the ones that gave us hell. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=697.283s">The</a>  smallest kindnesses we would make, like mixing a traveler's cold milkshake or fluffing the pillow of a boar whose ignorance we must endure. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=706.809s">Yet</a>  class and dignity ruled the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=709.251s">That</a>  is the enduring Blackbird way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=712.333s">Traveling</a>  the globe on speeding jets, circling the world as good as it gets, exploring exotic ports of call, winter and spring, summer and fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=723.142s">Aboard</a>  that luxury 747, just a whisper away from heaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=728.847s">We</a>  show white folks a grace unknown in all the flights they'd ever flown. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=732.95s">Pan</a>  Am said, yes, let's give them wings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=736.573s">We'll</a>  see just what their color brings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=739.915s">Just</a>  call us Blackbirds and hear the ring that speaks to a sister's natural swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=746.78s">Yes,</a>  call us Blackbirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=748.762s">It</a>  has that ring. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=750.163s">It</a>  speaks to our natural woman thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=754.746s">Give</a>  her a hand! <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=756.087s">Oh</a>  my gosh! <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=757.348s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=758.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=761.149s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=761.87s">I</a>  just want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=763.111s">Dive</a>  in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=764.052s">The</a>  Blackbirds, a group that I founded in 1918, we had a gathering of Blackbirds at Harvard Medical School. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=778.705s">And</a>  I called upon my wordsmith friend, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=785.251s">Mr.</a>  Terry to bring a little class, a little more class to the event and see if he could create a poem for us and this is what he came up with and I think it's fabulous and I think he deserves another round of applause.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=806.164s">All</a>  right, so let's dive right into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=809.445s">Dr.</a>  Shill, you've done a number of interviews with the news media, including WBUR and CNN, among others. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=817.609s">I'm</a>  always locked in on your pursuit of the opportunity to work with Pan Am as a 20-year-old college graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=825.051s">So</a>  can you talk about your initial interview with Pan Am?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=830.279s">Well,</a>  let's go back just a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=834.121s">I</a>  graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls in 1966. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=839.044s">You</a>  can do the math, okay, and figure out how old I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=843.286s">It</a>  was the only exam school for girls in Philadelphia at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=850.063s">There</a>  were very few of us women of color or young girls of color at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=855.487s">And</a>  we were all programmed to go to college, post high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=860.611s">However,</a>  when we were encouraged or when we had the interviews and the conversations with our guidance Councilors, many of us were told, oh, you're going to make a fabulous <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=875.203s">dental</a>  hygienists. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=876.385s">You're</a>  going to make a fabulous beauty parlor somebody or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=881.834s">And</a>  so when we went home to our parents and said, you know, this is what they're guiding us towards, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=890.527s">Our</a>  parents were like, oh, no, that's not how we roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=895.59s">Some</a>  of us were third generation college graduates who had been to HBCUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=903.034s">They</a>  were professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=904.936s">And</a>  it was like, oh, no, no, that's not how we roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=907.737s">However,</a>  I always wanted to be an actress. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=914.391s">In</a>  66, I wanted to be a ballerina. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=918.692s">And</a>  I was told that there was no future for a black ballerina. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=923.253s">That</a>  was just the beginning of the dance companies like Alvin Ailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=928.474s">And</a>  so I believed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=931.514s">And</a>  I said, well, I'm going to be an actress and a model. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=934.975s">How</a>  do I do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=936.715s">So</a>  I entered the Miss America contest in Philadelphia. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=942.49s">In</a>  1968, I was the only black to enter the contest, and that particular contest was the first step towards getting to the main Miss America contest that takes place in September in Atlantic City, New Jersey. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=963.019s">I</a>  prepared, I was excited, and I was thinking, oh boy, if I win, I'm gonna get discovered, and I will go to Hollywood, and oh, I was just, I had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=976.344s">So,</a>  the evening came, I was prepared, and I was one of the few participants standing as they were calling who was the winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=990.482s">So</a>  they did third runner-up, second runner-up, and I'm still standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=995.164s">Okay,</a>  there's a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=997.385s">And</a>  then they came to first runner-up, and that was my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1001.167s">I</a>  was a little pissed, but you know, I'm black. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1006.189s">I'm</a>  happy for first runner-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1008.73s">And</a>  then they announced the queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1011.471s">And</a>  so we all took photographs, and we were happy and bubbly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1017.214s">So</a>  when we're leaving the venue, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1020.68s">One</a>  of the judges came to my parents and me and asked if they could talk to my mother in private. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1027.243s">They</a>  pulled her over to the side and they said, we were unanimous in our choice of the queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1039.507s">We</a>  really wanted Sheila to win, but we weren't ready for a black queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1053.484s">Let</a>  that sink in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1056.927s">They</a>  weren't ready for a black queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1060.69s">Not</a>  because my talent wasn't good enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1065.534s">Not</a>  because I didn't answer the questions professionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1071.659s">But</a>  because of the color of my skin that God had given me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1078.964s">So</a>  I was a little annoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1080.345s">I</a>  was a little angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1083.639s">And</a>  what really was happening here was if anything had happened to the queen, I would become queen by default.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1096.227s">Anyway.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1107.543s">So</a>  I get, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1112.364s">I</a>  was happy to be first runner up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1115.585s">So</a>  it just so happened that the person who was Miss Congeniality, she said, Sheila, I know you want to be discovered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1125.227s">She</a>  said, the airlines are hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1127.667s">Maybe</a>  you'll get discovered on an airplane. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1129.988s">I</a>  said, okay, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1131.668s">So</a>  my friend Sandy and I were, you know, this is the 60s. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1136.249s">This</a>  is Vietnam War, this is Roe versus Wade, this is burn your bra, this is, you know, Kent State. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1144.012s">This</a>  is tumultuous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1146.593s">Contraceptives.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1147.854s">I</a>  mean, you know, so we were really active, for lack of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1153.936s">So</a>  Sandy and I looked in the <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1158.687s">Sunday</a>  newspaper that's where you know, that's the equivalent of Craigslist So you look in the Sunday paper in the one at section and so we looked under airlines and the only airlines we saw was Pan American World Airways <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1176.423s">So</a>  Sandy and I said, well, let's go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1178.345s">We</a>  called up for an interview date. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1182.309s">And</a>  the lady said, before we can give you an interview date, you have to pass certain requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1189.416s">You</a>  had to be a certain height, a certain weight, no eyeglasses, no braces, no acne. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1195.542s">I</a>  mean, it was just a bunch of no's. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1197.945s">However,</a>  you had to be college educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1200.708s">You</a>  had to have a second language. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1202.69s">You</a>  had to be at least 21, not married, no kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1207.315s">Oh,</a>  it's on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1209.077s">So</a>  we said, okay, we're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1211.839s">We</a>  got an interview date. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1213.882s">And</a>  the two of us went down to a local hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1217.851s">And</a>  when we entered the reception area, it was filled with the most beautiful women that you could ever see. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1229.801s">Sandy</a>  and I were the only women that looked like us in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1235.629s">Neither</a>  of us knew about Pan Am because Pan American at the time was strictly international. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1242.255s">African</a>  Americans, people of color, were going from Detroit to L.A., L.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1249.18s">to</a>  Miami, but we weren't going from New York to Paris. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1254.585s">We</a>  just weren't, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1256.907s">So</a>  as I sat there waiting for my interview, I read the brochure. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1266.118s">I</a>  looked at the brochure and I said, Paris? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1270.0s">Istanbul?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1271.701s">Around</a>  the world? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1274.203s">Oh</a>  my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1278.485s">I</a>  wanted that job more than I wanted to become Miss America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1282.208s">As</a>  quiet as it's kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1284.289s">So</a>  I sat there and I want to make this very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1290.813s">I</a>  sat there and I visualized myself on that airplane <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1298.744s">I</a>  wanted that job badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1301.086s">So</a>  I was called into the interview room, and I was told to have a seat, and we had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1309.974s">And</a>  the question of everybody was, why do you want to be a flight attendant? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1315.699s">We</a>  were stewardesses at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1317.34s">Why</a>  do you want to be a stewardess? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1319.622s">And</a>  of course, the answer was, I love people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1327.845s">So</a>  I love people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1329.566s">And</a>  then I was asked some questions in my language, which was Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1335.969s">I</a>  had taken four years of Spanish at high school and a year of Italian in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1340.591s">So</a>  I was fairly competent in Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1344.353s">I</a>  had a great accent, but I didn't know anything about subjunctive. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1348.975s">I</a>  didn't know anything about conditional, but I can work present and past tense, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1354.657s">And</a>  that's exactly what I did then, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1358.498s">I</a>  turned the interview around to present and past tense. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1364.68s">With</a>  my accent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1366.341s">And</a>  then he said, walk across the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1371.468s">I</a>  knew how to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1373.911s">So</a>  I walked across the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1376.034s">And</a>  then he said, well, thank you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1379.318s">Nutt.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1381.621s">We</a>  will get in touch with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1383.924s">He</a>  said, if you're selected to go to the next level, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1388.689s">you'll</a>  get a telegram, and telegram is 1960 text message, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1396.752s">And</a>  so he walked me to the door and he says, and the next time you go for an interview, make sure you're not chewing gum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1407.878s">What</a>  had happened when I was nervous, I put a small piece of gum into my mouth to freshen my breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1414.965s">You</a>  don't want to go into an interview with funky breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1417.507s">So</a>  I forgot to take it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1420.97s">And</a>  I could just imagine I must have been sitting there <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1425.669s">You</a>  know, nervous as a cow, chewing on my cud. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1429.511s">But</a>  anyway, to make a long story short, I got the telegram, and I was told I passed that, and I had to take a medical exam and an eye exam.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1442.597s">Okay,</a>  so I think you teased it a little bit, but I want to hone in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1448.2s">What</a>  was the attraction for you in trying to become a stewardess?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1452.921s">I</a>  wanted to get discovered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1455.202s">I</a>  wanted to get discovered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1456.823s">And</a>  the beauty here is that I wanted to be an actress. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1463.507s">I</a>  wanted to be a model. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1467.509s">And</a>  back in the day, in the 60s, becoming a model and an actress required for <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1477.805s">young</a>  girls to make certain choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1482.189s">And</a>  so I believe God did not allow me to become a model or an actress when I was a 20-something because he had a different plan for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1502.045s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1504.801s">His</a>  plan for me was to retire from Harvard Medical School and not Hollywood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1515.391s">He</a>  told me, Sheila, you will be a fabulous actress and a model, but you've got to wait 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1523.839s">And</a>  I say wait 50 years because I have two Wayfair commercials. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1532.106s">I</a>  have done commercials for stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1536.427s">I</a>  have done commercials for Star Market. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1540.269s">And</a>  so now I can go for an interview or for a work that I <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1550.436s">It's</a>  strictly my credentials.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1554.678s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1555.678s">Look</a>  at this face. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1557.499s">Look</a>  at this face. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1558.559s">How</a>  could she not be successful? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1560.9s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1562.44s">So</a>  training classes that prepared you to get on that plane, what were they like?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1570.226s">Oh,</a>  well, like I said, Pan Am was strictly international. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1575.868s">And</a>  at the time, Pan American World Airways passengers were diplomats, heads of state, heads of major corporations and organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1588.733s">So</a>  we were trained to be hostesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1591.874s">We</a>  were trained to be hospitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1594.635s">We</a>  were trained in emergency to keep our passengers safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1600.077s">We</a>  were encouraged to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1603.101s">We</a>  were encouraged to be able to carry on a conversation with heads of state, with diplomats, with international people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1612.594s">We</a>  were required to take language <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1617.861s">to</a>  learn as many languages as possible so that we could speak to our passengers in whatever language they spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1628.629s">I</a>  was eventually qualified in Spanish and Swahili. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1634.353s">because</a>  I wanted to travel to Africa. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1637.794s">I</a>  wanted to travel to Kenya and Tanzania. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1640.694s">So</a>  I learned how to speak Swahili. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1643.415s">Pan</a>  American at the time was very slow during the winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1649.416s">So</a>  they would encourage us to take unpaid leaves of absence and travel around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1657.678s">We</a>  could travel for free to Fiji. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1661.599s">to</a>  London. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1662.92s">And</a>  I was really concerned because my husband, who is, I can't tell where he's from, but anyway, when we were married, I said, well, let's go to London, or no, let's go to Rome for dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1679.312s">Oh,</a>  Sheila, I'm scared to fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1681.854s">If</a>  I go anywhere, I've got to stay for a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1685.828s">I</a>  said, the beauty of being a stewardess is to be able to travel at the drop of a hat, go for dinner, stay overnight, and come back home. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1695.898s">So</a>  he really wasn't able to take advantage of the travel benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1700.963s">But</a>  yes, we were trained to be hostesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1704.527s">A</a>  friend of mine was on an airplane <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1709.472s">domestic</a>  flight and he was sitting in first class and he said the stewardess, the flight attendant, came to him and said, oh, would you like red wine or white wine? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1722.662s">And</a>  he said, well, what kind of wine is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1727.726s">She</a>  didn't even know the label of the wine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1732.199s">We</a>  were sommeliers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1734.76s">We</a>  knew where the wine came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1737.541s">We</a>  knew what it was paired with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1740.883s">We</a>  cooked food on the airplane. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1744.944s">We</a>  served caviar. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1755.421s">Flying</a>  first class in Pan Am was like traveling on a first-class five-star restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1762.385s">Actually,</a>  Maxim's, the restaurant, was our caterer in first class.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1769.864s">Wow,</a>  wow.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1771.165s">So</a>  when did you start flying? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1773.886s">And</a>  what were those early flights like for you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1775.987s">So</a>  I was hired in 1969, but I had to finish school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1784.011s">And</a>  so when I did finish that May, they didn't have a training class. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1790.114s">So</a>  they said, we are bringing the 747. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1795.137s">And</a>  we will need to train people starting in January because the 747 was going to be part of the Pan Am fleet in 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1806.763s">So</a>  I started training school in January 12, 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1811.226s">I</a>  was the only African American in my class. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1815.088s">And</a>  there were some women in the class who had never seen an African American in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1823.272s">And</a>  so what they knew about African Americans was what they saw in the news media, what they read in Life magazine, there was no People magazine then, or what they were told by family and friends, and it wasn't always true.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1840.404s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1841.425s">Okay,</a>  so it kind of dovetails into my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1845.488s">Did</a>  you experience racism, and how did it come to you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1851.394s">Racism.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1852.835s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1853.855s">So</a>  in training school, everybody was nice because you wanted to keep your job, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1861.598s">And</a>  stewardesses were supposed to be nice people, hospitable and very nice, compassionate, you know, getting along with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1874.023s">So</a>  in training school, it wasn't a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1876.504s">Everybody</a>  was nice, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1879.145s">And</a>  Pan American encouraged their employees from stewardesses to people who took care of the airplane, who brought the food on the airplane. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1889.888s">They</a>  were encouraged to embrace and respect diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1896.35s">I'm</a>  very proud to be part of Pan American because that was the beginning of my <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1903.052s">introduction</a>  to the value and importance and what diversity does for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1913.076s">So</a>  at the end of training school, my training class was assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1920.419s">So</a>  since the two women who I had roomed with during training school were based in Miami, we said, why don't we continue and get an apartment together? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1933.191s">That</a>  sounded nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1934.592s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1936.313s">So</a>  the three of us looked in the Sunday newspaper under apartments, and we found a list of apartments that we were going to check out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1947.918s">The</a>  first apartment we went to, the landlord said, I don't rent to Puerto Ricans. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1959.264s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1960.824s">I</a>  ain't Puerto Rican. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1963.799s">We</a>  said, OK, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1966.521s">We</a>  went to the next place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1970.444s">That</a>  landlord said, you want me to put a Negro in my apartment? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1979.781s">I</a>  said, come on, let's go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1982.503s">So</a>  the third place we went to, the lady was very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1988.287s">She</a>  says, oh, I'm so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1991.21s">We</a>  just rented that apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1994.612s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=1996.293s">So</a>  one of my roommates, I won't mention her name because I've done it before and I made the wrong, I said the wrong name. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2003.639s">One</a>  of my roommates looked at me and said, Sheila, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2007.276s">we</a>  would have an apartment if it wasn't for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2012.059s">And</a>  I thought, and I'm going to live with her? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2016.862s">Anyway,</a>  so we didn't have an apartment, but we did have time still in the hotel where we were staying. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2025.528s">So</a>  one day, I was at the airport, and I saw a woman in a Pan Am uniform <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2031.132s">with</a>  an afro out to here and I ran over to her and I said, where do you live? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2039.139s">And</a>  so she told me, and it happened to be an apartment complex where a lot of airline people were living. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2046.84s">And</a>  so we, the three of us, were able to get an apartment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2051.661s">And</a>  I want, no, I'm not gonna say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2053.462s">Anyway,</a>  so we got an apartment, and this woman who said we would have an apartment if it wasn't for you, didn't pass the training period.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2068.604s">Comma</a>  is a... Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2072.217s">Comma.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2073.06s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2073.782s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2074.464s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2074.906s">So...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2077.273s">What</a>  privileges do you feel you gained from your experiences as a stewardess with PNAM?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2084.794s">Privilege.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2087.775s">I</a>  had the privilege of traveling the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2093.436s">I</a>  had the privilege of seeing countries that I had only read about in history books. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2101.578s">And</a>  I must admit, Terry, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2104.718s">It</a>  did make me wish that I'd paid more attention in school to some of the world history courses that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2113.224s">But</a>  yes, the privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2116.767s">I</a>  went to Egypt in 1972. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2120.85s">I</a>  took a leave of absence from Pan Am, and I traveled around the continent of Africa looking for my roots. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2131.777s">I</a>  remember with Pan American, I could travel first class for $25.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2137.001s">Oh</a>  my gosh.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2138.262s">And</a>  so that was only part of Africa. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2140.544s">The</a>  rest of Africa and Europe that would get me to these different places was Alitalia Airline, and I had to pay $125 to travel around the Alitalia network. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2155.234s">So</a>  I remember going to Athens and there was I was from Athens I was gonna go on to Egypt and Ethiopia and I met another stewardess from Air Canada I think and she says oh I <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2170.464s">why</a>  don't you join me and we're driving to Rome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2175.186s">I</a>  said, no, no, no, no, I'm going to Egypt. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2178.168s">Oh,</a>  no, I don't think you should do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2180.288s">I</a>  said, look, I've always wanted to see the pyramids. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2184.17s">I</a>  have always wanted to see the Nile. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2187.792s">I'm</a>  going to Egypt. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2189.072s">So</a>  I went to Egypt, and I had a lovely time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2192.154s">I</a>  must admit, I was terribly disappointed in the Nile. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2197.596s">I</a>  was expecting to see little baby boys in little baskets, and that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2202.94s">It</a>  looked like the, it looked like the Charles is quite a kid, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2208.623s">But</a>  the pyramids, it was fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2212.165s">I</a>  was 20-something at the time with a short afro and hipsters and, you know, short <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2220.77s">Tops</a>  were in vogue, and that's what I was wearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2224.812s">I</a>  was not educated, not respectful of the culture where women are supposed to be covered, but it was hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2236.159s">And</a>  I felt I was, it was okay to dress the way I wanted to, but it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2243.464s">Because</a>  there was an elderly gentleman in the place where I had breakfast who said, oh, Sheila, you catch cold, you should, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2253.331s">cover</a>  yourself here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2254.892s">And</a>  he gave me some fabric. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2256.993s">And</a>  I was smart enough to take the hint. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2261.014s">But</a>  at that time in 1972, Egyptian women were not traveling by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2268.618s">So</a>  I was an anomaly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2270.698s">And</a>  plus, Egypt and America weren't friends at that time either. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2274.82s">So</a>  I was an anomaly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2276.881s">in</a>  Egypt at the time, and so people stared at me, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2281.905s">However,</a>  when I went to Ethiopia, I blended in, and I fell in love with Ethiopia, so much so that I decided I was gonna come back and get an education as a teacher, find an Ethiopian husband, and come back to Ethiopia and open a school where I wanted to live.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2303.857s">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2304.697s">Took</a>  me 13 years to find that Ethiopian man, and I found him right over in Mattapan. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2314.401s">We</a>  spent 10 years raising our children in Ethiopia, and we've been together 39 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2320.844s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2326.184s">And</a>  the daughters are beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2329.287s">They're</a>  just like their mama.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2331.109s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2331.81s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2332.811s">OK,</a>  so fast forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2336.454s">You</a>  finished up with Pan Am when? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2338.236s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2341.319s">And</a>  did you go directly to Harvard from Pan Am?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2346.304s">So</a>  when I left Pan Am, I had finished my doctorate in education at Boston University and I did my dissertation on stress and flight attendants. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2360.276s">I</a>  started a business called Flight Attendant Network where I <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2366.301s">taught</a>  people how to get hired with the airlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2370.044s">I</a>  provided a stress management program for stewardesses or flight attendants. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2377.229s">And</a>  then if they weren't happy, I provided workshops on outplacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2384.313s">So</a>  if you weren't happy as a stewardess, let's find another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2389.137s">Because</a>  I do believe <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2391.158s">in</a>  work-life balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2393.36s">And</a>  so many people stay at a job, and there were stewardesses who stayed at the job for the paycheck and for the travel benefits, and they were miserable, and they made their passengers miserable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2406.892s">Okay,</a>  and so my theory was you don't have to be miserable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2411.475s">There's</a>  another job for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2413.116s">There's</a>  another place where you can find joy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2416.698s">When</a>  you travel now, look at the faces of those flight attendants who are serving you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2422.321s">See</a>  if there's some joy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2423.962s">You</a>  know, I just think people should find joy in their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2429.025s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2431.98s">Yeah,</a>  I left Pan Am and I worked with a non-profit organization in Boston that resettled Ethiopian refugees and refugees from around the world because this was the height of the famine in Ethiopia. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2446.384s">And</a>  this was when there was fighting throughout Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2453.886s">So</a>  we were doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2456.247s">Then</a>  I worked at Emanuel College as the Director of Multicultural Affairs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2463.052s">And</a>  while at Emanuel, I was curious about how refugee women were adjusting to America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2475.061s">Many</a>  of these refugee women had walked from Ethiopia to Sudan. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2482.086s">Many</a>  of them from other parts of Africa had walked from their country to refugee camps. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2489.11s">And</a>  I thought, I got students over here that can't walk from, you know, Mattapan to Dudley Station, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2499.277s">And</a>  many of these women had been raped. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2502.972s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2504.173s">They</a>  landed in their refugee camps pregnant and they didn't know who the father of that child was. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2511.136s">They</a>  finally got to America and this was very different for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2516.519s">And</a>  so when I asked these women, why aren't you involved in negative dysfunctional behavior? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2525.864s">And</a>  to the person, their answer was, I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2532.256s">my</a>  religion. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2537.181s">I</a>  would disrespect my parents if I took drugs, if I became an alcoholic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2545.569s">I</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2546.61s">So</a>  I began to look at what is the role of religion in maintaining culture and maintaining <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2558.058s">wholeness.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2559.279s">And</a>  so then I pursued a master's in theological studies from Harvard Divinity School, where I looked at the role of women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo religion, Christianity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2576.166s">And</a>  if I may just inform our listeners, Ethiopia has been practicing Christianity since 325 AD. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2588.161s">And</a>  the first person that the Apostle Philip baptized <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2597.489s">was</a>  an Ethiopian eunuch when Philip was on his way to Pentecost. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2602.21s">Ethiopia</a>  is mentioned over 38 times in the Bible. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2605.951s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2606.911s">So</a>  I was curious about this religion, and so that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2610.231s">I</a>  looked at the Ethiopian church at Harvard and the role of women. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2617.013s">And</a>  fortunately, I was able to go back to Ethiopia <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2623.535s">once</a>  the communist government had been overthrown, and we were able to raise our children there, and the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the late Abuna Paulos, may his soul rest in peace, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2638.897s">had</a>  been here in Boston area as a refugee and finished his master's and a PhD here in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2650.884s">And</a>  I'm not sure, I think one was at Yale and another one was at Princeton. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2655.606s">And</a>  he wanted to bring the Ethiopian church, the Ethiopian culture into the, he wanted to move them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2665.271s">So</a>  he said, Sheila, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2667.754s">I</a>  would like for you to teach at the school where we train our priests. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2675.818s">So</a>  I was very excited because I'm basically an educator and I have this background in religion and African-American studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2686.063s">My</a>  first degree was in African-American studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2689.285s">So</a>  I taught at the school for one semester because the <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2697.129s">bishops</a>  and the other priests said it was blasphemy for a female to teach priests, potential priests. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2710.674s">So</a>  that was my experience there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2713.075s">But</a>  once I left Pan Am, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2716.936s">I</a>  pursued the education in higher ed and then we went to Ethiopia where I taught at the Greek school there and I provided training for students who were looking for colleges in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2733.271s">I</a>  did SAT training. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2735.012s">I</a>  also worked in the, at the, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2739.276s">United</a>  Nations Economic Commission for Africa, where I taught report writing skills, as well as how to communicate within the workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2751.021s">And</a>  that was another opportunity to really develop my skill set and expertise in, what, diversity, diverse cultures, because the UN has employees from practically every country <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2766.827s">in</a>  the world and they speak just about every language. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2771.05s">So</a>  how do you make a team out of so much diversity? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2775.693s">Well,</a>  that was what we did at Pan Am. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2778.335s">Pan</a>  Am had women and men from every country that they flew to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2785.86s">And</a>  the purpose of that was so that the passengers who were going to Paris <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2791.343s">there</a>  would be a woman on the airplane from France who could tell these passengers what to see, what to do, who could speak the language, and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2801.729s">If</a>  there was somebody leaving France, coming to America, and there had limited English, there was somebody on the airplane from France who could adjust or help them in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2814.377s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2816.215s">So</a>  I want to try and bring, because we're getting close to our time, I want to ask a couple more questions, kind of bring this full circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2825.297s">It's</a>  International Women's History Day today.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2829.058s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2830.418s">And</a>  obviously you are an international trailblazer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2833.959s">I</a>  want to ask you what that means to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2838.38s">What</a>  it means to me <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2842.108s">is</a>  the fact that women are awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2852.036s">And</a>  I'm going to quote a famous comedian who said, he was, I'm paraphrasing now, and he said, I'm afraid of any animal <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2873.044s">any</a>  animal that can carry another animal in their body, that can give birth, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2886.731s">So</a>  that is one aspect of our awesomeness. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2891.653s">But</a>  internationally, the comments are made that if you can train a woman, if you can educate a woman, if you can educate a mother, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2901.823s">You're</a>  educating a community.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2903.785s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2904.745s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2905.466s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2906.547s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2907.808s">So</a>  no offense, brother, to you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2909.509s">I'm</a>  not mad at you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2911.41s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2912.191s">No</a>  haters. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2914.072s">But</a>  we are just bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2915.233s">So</a>  can I get a hand for the women?</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2920.718s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2921.478s">So</a>  that's a good segue into this other question I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2926.542s">Talk</a>  a little bit about your Blackbirds group.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2929.204s">Oh,</a>  thank you, thank you, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2931.245s">So,</a>  like I said, when I got started in training class in 1970, there were very few of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2940.828s">And</a>  the numbers increased a little bit because of the act, the Civil Rights Act of 1965. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2950.511s">So,</a>  what I'm trying to do is to create a community <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2959.938s">of</a>  women of color who began flying with Pan American in the 60s and 70s up until the time that Pan American went bankrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2975.041s">And</a>  I think that was 91. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2976.842s">And</a>  there were a lot of components that contributed to Pan American's demise. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2984.083s">And</a>  I won't go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2985.284s">You</a>  can Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2987.685s">So</a>  what we're trying to do is create this cohort of women, and I have named them Pan Am Blackbirds because we are women of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=2998.79s">And</a>  so what we're trying to do now, and Brother Terry was part of our first gathering at Harvard Medical School in September of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3010.234s">I'm</a>  trying to tell the stories of these women because we were trailblazers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3019.059s">We</a>  were trailblazers because we were pretty, but we were smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3026.662s">And</a>  I want the stories of how we were hired, but the beauty of the Blackbirds is what did we do after Pan American? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3039.247s">We</a>  have educators, we have lawyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3043.948s">Two</a>  of my Blackbirds, one was nominated by President Bill Clinton, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3052.674s">and</a>  confirmed by the Senate to be the executive director of the African Development Bank in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa, with the title of ambassador. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3064.481s">Another</a>  blackbird was <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3069.147s">nominated</a>  and confirmed by the Senate under Joseph Biden to be the executive director of the African Development Bank at Côte d'Ivoire. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3079.712s">So</a>  I've got two of my Blackbirds who are ambassadors. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3084.915s">One</a>  of my Blackbirds retired from an international pharmaceutical company. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3090.899s">I've</a>  got nurses, physicians, I've got entrepreneurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3095.381s">I</a>  want the world <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3098.632s">to</a>  hear how we were hired as young women, and we're all over 70, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3108.358s">And</a>  we are having a reunion in September of 2024, and I am in the process of trying to create a documentary, write a book, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3120.626s">book</a>  about us, and I'm hoping to launch a podcast to tell the stories of these women, to let young people know that racism, discrimination existed 50 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3139.142s">And</a>  unfortunately, it still exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3141.824s">But</a>  we cannot allow it to create our narrative.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3147.029s">That's</a>  right, that's right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3149.042s">How</a>  did we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3151.804s">We</a>  need to let young people know how we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3155.266s">And</a>  how did we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3157.868s">We</a>  did it because we knew who we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3161.451s">Who</a>  are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3162.632s">We're</a>  not just pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3164.993s">We</a>  were created by an awesome God. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3168.156s">And</a>  if somebody isn't ready for our color, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3171.84s">That's</a>  their problem, not ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3174.381s">We</a>  have a divine purpose.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3176.422s">There</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3177.642s">And</a>  we, my black birds, got in sync with that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3183.125s">And</a>  we went on to be who we were meant to be post-Pan Am.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3187.407s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3188.147s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3188.727s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3190.788s">So</a>  I want to give you the last word. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3192.209s">Do</a>  you have any parting thoughts?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3197.97s">Well,</a>  I'm retired, so I do a lot of thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3205.094s">But</a>  my parting thought is one of the reasons that I want to tell our stories, one of the reasons I'm grateful to be here with each of you tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3223.095s">is</a>  because I embrace an African proverb. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3228.896s">To</a>  paraphrase it, it says, until the lion can tell his story, the hunter will always tell them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3246.499s">The</a>  hunter is glorified. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3248.841s">You</a>  see? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3250.262s">So,</a>  I want our stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3252.403s">Stories</a>  are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3255.865s">Our</a>  personal narrative is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3258.687s">Because</a>  each of us has something valuable to add to the tapestry of this life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3269.455s">Each</a>  of us is valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3271.116s">Each</a>  of you is valued.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3274.853s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3275.576s">I</a>  love it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3276.619s">So</a>  in closing, I want everybody to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3281.266s">of</a>  a word because in my programming I always had my students do something called high five because my students were traditionally students from underserved communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3293.771s">And</a>  so I had them practice reinforcing the positiveness about themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3302.534s">So</a>  they always had to do a high five. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3305.696s">And</a>  what's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3307.476s">Five</a>  different <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3310.08s">adjectives</a>  about yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3313.703s">And</a>  they must begin with I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3317.146s">Not</a>  I'm. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3321.089s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3322.29s">Bold.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3323.211s">I</a>  am confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3325.112s">I</a>  am capable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3327.534s">These</a>  are qualities that are going to help you to be successful in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3332.018s">One</a>  student said, oh, that's cheesy, Dr. Sheila. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3336.394s">But</a>  at the end of the program, he said, ooh, that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3340.397s">And</a>  it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3342.038s">So</a>  that's in closing, Mr. Terry.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3344.92s">It's</a>  amazing, because this conversation could go on literally for hours and hours and hours, because <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3352.686s">This</a>  woman has, I think I have stories, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3356.547s">But</a>  this woman has stories on top of stories on top of stories and we could literally do this for an hour more and still only scratch the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3366.691s">But</a>  I just, I wanna thank you because you have blessed my folk. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3372.473s">You're</a>  so engaging, your story is so amazing and <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3377.154s">We're</a>  looking forward to the podcast, the documentary, the book, and whatever else you want to do to tell the story of those wonderful Blackbirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3386.93s">So</a>  give it up for Sheila E. Nutt.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3395.029s">I</a>  also want to say that I'm working with a young communications graduate at LaSalle University in Newton, and she's trying to get me to do some TikTok. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3412.037s">And</a>  so I'm thinking that I may have a TikTok handle called notes from the nuthouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3423.211s">So</a>  look out for that one as well.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3425.173s">Now</a>  you be careful with that TikTok cause they a whole lot of mess on TikTok. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3429.839s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3430.239s">Okay,</a>  folks, so we're going to take a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3433.14s">We're</a>  going to reset this area so that we can get ready for our musical performance for the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3440.262s">I'll</a>  be back with some announcements. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3442.262s">There</a>  are some refreshments in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3444.763s">Janelle</a>  Coleman has made some delicious little niblets, so you can go back there, and before they're all gone, you can go grab yourself something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3452.805s">We</a>  have some water. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3453.645s">We</a>  have some other snacks back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3455.385s">And</a>  we'll be back in just a few minutes with part two <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3458.887s">of</a>  First Fridays, Flex Fridays, words, and music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3727.145s">Okay,</a>  folks, if you can take your seats, we're going to get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3732.186s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3762.697s">Should</a>  I see everybody back there biting on Janelle's food? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3766.179s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3767.44s">That's</a>  how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3781.047s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3782.728s">So</a>  we're ready to get started again. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3786.112s">Now,</a>  I don't ordinarily do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3789.413s">I</a>  usually do one piece of poetry at the beginning and then we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3794.694s">But</a>  I think in this particular instance, I'm going to do one more piece because, well, you'll understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3805.137s">This</a>  piece is called Brown Girl at the Cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3810.424s">For</a>  a moment, I blinked at what I was seeing, this chocolate hint of a Renaissance being. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3818.379s">My</a>  ears abruptly filled with sound that made my senses rise spellbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3823.442s">Was</a>  it a wistful wail or a spectral moan? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3826.023s">Was</a>  it borrowed or was it her own? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3828.863s">As</a>  she brought her bow across the strings, it made me reflect on a thousand things of how our people persevered, a race at once reviled and revered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3840.426s">As</a>  her fingers danced, so flowing in light, it made me recall the joy of our flight across the land to freedom's beacon, to the flame of liberty we'd been seeking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3851.465s">The</a>  voicings of that hourglass frame remove the fear, the hurt, and shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3857.613s">It</a>  led us away from racial scorn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3859.875s">It</a>  led us away from hate forsworn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3862.779s">It</a>  led us away from love forlorn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3865.122s">It</a>  led us to places where grace is born. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3870.697s">The</a>  soul at peace is how it settles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3873.379s">No</a>  thorns, no briars, no stinging nettles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3875.901s">Was</a>  it a siren song in the dead of night or a distant horizon beckoning bright? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3881.384s">As</a>  she brought her bow across those strings, the spirit moves and her cello sings. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3889.036s">I</a>  watched a little girl watch in wonder and knew in my heart the spell she was under. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3895.542s">I</a>  thought I would weep at her earnest glance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3898.905s">The</a>  instrument's melody made her dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3901.767s">New</a>  confidence born in this tiny frame whose life will never be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3907.072s">She</a>  saw a brown girl like herself take a symphony down from the shelf. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3912.716s">Where</a>  limitation is so often placed, she witnessed the captor's lie erased. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3918.901s">She</a>  saw that cellist pluck those strings and imagined herself as a thousand things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3926.086s">The</a>  confidence born in this tiny frame whose life will never be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3935.492s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3937.365s">Tonight</a>  we feature a well-established and highly professional performer that has gained a huge following and has also made some important history in Massachusetts and New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3948.156s">It</a>  gives me great pleasure to introduce a symphonic sensation by the name of Mashunda Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3960.294s">She</a>  is a composer, a conductor, and a highly skilled teacher with an amazing repertoire and a broad musical vocabulary as you will soon see and hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3971.567s">Originally</a>  hailing from Tennessee, Mashunda's enchantment with music began in the sixth grade when she picked up the cello <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3980.279s">Initially</a>  sparked by a teenage crush, her passion quickly evolved into a genuine love for the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3987.749s">Earning</a>  her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville marked the inception of her musical odyssey. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=3995.66s">Embarking</a>  first on a teaching career, she later obtained a master's degree in orchestral conducting with a focus on music education at the University of Southern Maine, receiving mentorship from distinguished conductors like James Fellenbaum, Victor Yampolsky, Robert Lehman, Adrian Ganam, and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4016.013s">With</a>  serious musical credits in tow, her symphonic journey ultimately led her to the Boston area, where she established herself on the North Shore while maintaining connections in Maine and New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4028.502s">Mashunda</a>  co-founded the groundbreaking No Name Orchestra of Boston in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4035.146s">This</a>  innovative ensemble challenges norms by bringing soloists and orchestra members together for performances without rehearsals, fostering spontaneous and captivating musical experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4047.931s">Now</a>  in its eighth year, the No Name Orchestra continues to captivate audiences across the Boston metro area with its unique approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4059.648s">It's</a>  important work that she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4062.27s">She</a>  is now the conductor of the Lowell Philharmonic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4068.194s">And</a>  she is the first woman of color ever to be so named by that splendid orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4076.419s">She</a>  is teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4078.4s">She</a>  has her own private music studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4081.682s">She</a>  is also teaching in the public school system, doing a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4087.526s">to</a>  educate children in music and also to give them the confidence to be able to play as she plays and she plays. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4098.295s">I'm</a>  going to get out the way and the next thing you hear will be the lustrous Mashunda Smith.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4110.966s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4114.109s">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4115.31s">I'm</a>  going to start with one piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4119.127s">This</a>  is called Folk Suite for Solo Cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4124.232s">It's</a>  by another cellist named Daniel Delaney. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4129.016s">And</a>  I like this because since I'm from Tennessee, there's a lot of folk music, bluegrass and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4135.081s">So</a>  this, I found this some years ago and it kind of struck me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4139.385s">So</a>  I'm gonna start with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4140.947s">This</a>  is the prelude to his suite. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4329.315s">Well,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4330.295s">That</a>  was a wonderful introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4334.616s">Yes,</a>  Marshaunda Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4336.796s">I</a>  like to do these. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4337.796s">I</a>  just want to tell you a story of how I got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4344.938s">Whenever</a>  I meet someone, I'm like, oh, you're so fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4348.578s">How</a>  did you get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4350.219s">Like,</a>  what is your story? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4352.819s">How</a>  many times have somebody actually said, how did you get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4357.22s">And</a>  genuinely, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4358.877s">want</a>  to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4361.478s">I</a>  find it so fascinating to just listen to somebody's stories and hopefully you learn something about yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4375.505s">You</a>  learn something about the world that you didn't know before. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4381.587s">Some</a>  lessons learned and just <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4386.517s">Listen,</a>  just be in their presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4389.818s">Let</a>  them tell their story, because odds are no one's asked them, like, how did you get here at this moment in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4399.26s">We're</a>  intersecting right here at this moment, at this time, and this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4403.721s">How</a>  did you get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4405.081s">What</a>  brought you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4406.462s">So</a>  I'm gonna start from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4409.229s">I</a>  was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4412.67s">I'm</a>  from Chattanooga, Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4414.971s">You'll</a>  probably hear my accent come in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4419.733s">I've</a>  been told when I get upset, it really comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4424.435s">I</a>  do know that it comes out when I'm articulating for my students, especially if I'm giving them the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4432.539s">I'm</a>  speaking very clearly, darling. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4439.252s">I</a>  went to a school called Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, and it was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4447.298s">It</a>  was about 53% white, 46% black, and it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4462.432s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4463.692s">All</a>  friends were all friends with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4466.533s">And</a>  we got different perspectives from people who lived on Signal Mountain, people who lived on Lookout Mountain, people who lived in the projects, people who just lived in suburbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4477.495s">It</a>  was actually, I found it fascinating just to hear their stories, how they get to school, what they do after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4488.017s">Yeah,</a>  but sometimes there's a little jealousy going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4491.72s">Why</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4492.642s">Some</a>  kids are doing some things that you think are cool and you can't do it or you don't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4498.535s">But</a>  my school was the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4502.17s">time</a>  that I really saw different people and actually enjoyed their lives, enjoyed their stories, the difference of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4514.295s">I</a>  wasn't jealous by it, but it was fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4517.616s">Like,</a>  oh, we can coexist in this same world and have totally different walks of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4526.539s">I</a>  find that very fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4530.001s">So</a>  I'm gonna play another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4533.258s">And</a>  this one is from the same folk suite, Daniel Delaney. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4541.542s">And</a>  this is his lullaby. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4543.442s">Pardon.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4744.048s">So</a>  I graduated from Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4747.43s">It</a>  was a class of 97, so we knew everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4750.911s">And</a>  I went to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4756.114s">Go</a>  Vols. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4759.095s">And</a>  I went there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4760.576s">Well,</a>  actually, first I took one year at the University of Chattanooga. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4765.518s">And</a>  then I went to the University of Knoxville, and I went there on a full scholarship, which was quite nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4775.603s">in</a>  music, but that wasn't the original plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4781.026s">I</a>  actually liked math and science, but no university was really giving out a scholarship for math and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4792.466s">I</a>  got one easily for music, easily for music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4796.911s">While</a>  I was in high school, I kept getting these high marks in music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4800.656s">And</a>  I went to Allstate and AllEast, and it was fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4804.881s">It</a>  was really fun doing all this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4807.103s">And</a>  during these Allstate things, they checked you on <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4812.159s">Can</a>  they play a scale? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4813.38s">Can</a>  they play the prepared piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4815.021s">Can</a>  they sight read? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4816.923s">And</a>  for those who don't know, sight reading is they put a piece of music in front of you and you play it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4823.067s">How</a>  perfect can you be at just you're seeing it for the first time? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4827.611s">And</a>  I was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4828.811s">I</a>  was really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4832.154s">It</a>  was due to my math. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4835.658s">It</a>  was due to my math, because I knew how to divide and do all the things that music was asking me to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4845.463s">And</a>  so I loved math, but I got a full scholarship, so that kind of made my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4855.547s">One</a>  of the things back in high school that I think I knew that I was going to go into music, my best friend Lauren and I, we were doing some musical thing in the state for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4872.034s">I</a>  can't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4872.575s">They</a>  start to blur together. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4874.215s">And</a>  we were in middle Tennessee at, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4879.062s">a</a>  really cute college that looks like Europe, old Europe in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4884.471s">And</a>  we were leaving, and I have to put my jello down for this, because this is like interactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4895.811s">So</a>  we had just finished Allstate Orchestra, like a few weeks prior, and we played Dvorak Symphony No. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4904.578s">8</a>  or 7, one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4907.1s">And</a>  we had prepared it and we had played it and we were just like, yes! <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4911.323s">And</a>  she's a violinist, a black violinist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4913.624s">And</a>  so we're just like, this is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4915.344s">And</a>  her dad, Mr. Goss, her dad is driving us from these college visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4921.726s">And</a>  it was raining, and we were in his van. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4925.166s">And</a>  Dvorak came on the radio. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4927.767s">And</a>  she started singing her violin part, and I'm singing the cello part. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4932.088s">And</a>  we got to this tumultuous part in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4934.669s">It's</a>  like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4937.289s">She's</a>  singing it, and I know Mr. Goss was just like, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4942.15s">well,</a>  what are you gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4943.371s">These</a>  two girls are just rocking out to this classical music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4947.513s">And</a>  so it's raining, he's trying to focus on her, the two screaming girls are ready to scream at this classical music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4954.938s">And</a>  then all of a sudden, it got to this, the climax of this movement, and at the same time it got to the climax, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4966.081s">It</a>  stopped raining, and the sun just shone right there in front of us as we were driving on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4974.184s">And</a>  we stopped, and we're like, did that just happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4977.905s">And</a>  Mr. Goss was like, yeah, that did just happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4980.646s">It</a>  did just happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4981.527s">I</a>  was like, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4983.479s">What</a>  are the odds? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4985.0s">What</a>  are the odds that that happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4986.942s">That</a>  was one of the moments that I thought, I like this feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=4991.707s">I</a>  don't know if I brought that on or Lauren brought that on, but this feeling of having fun in the music and feeling good about it, and then having someone next to you just nerding out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5006.02s">You're</a>  just nerding out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5006.901s">It</a>  was so much fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5008.806s">And</a>  then a couple of months later, we went to Hunter Museum in Chattanooga, was hosting the Chattanooga String Quartet from the Chattanooga Symphony. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5021.197s">And</a>  they were playing Schubert's The Trout. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5026.661s">And</a>  at that time, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5029.033s">The</a>  viola, which is, the violas get so much bad rap in the orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5034.7s">They're</a>  like the middle stepchild, and they get so much bad rap. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5039.245s">But</a>  so we sat right there in front, and of course, you know, two little black girls like sitting right there in front, and everybody's like, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5048.674s">okay</a>  we're like hi we sat there right there in front we were ready we've been hearing all about the Schubert trial just like okay what is this we get in free let's go Lauren we went set right there in the front and the viola line we were so impressed by the viola we're like violas have things <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5071.863s">They</a>  can play things too? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5074.645s">We</a>  were so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5076.826s">And</a>  so any student right now, or even in my orchestras, they know that I call the viola section the cream of an orchestra, of the string section. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5087.693s">Because</a>  without the cream in an Oreo, there's just two cookies. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5091.395s">You</a>  have the cello and you have the violin. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5093.677s">That's</a>  just two cookies. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5094.838s">But</a>  the cream, that bridge is the middle part. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5099.471s">I</a>  love the viola sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5100.993s">And</a>  so just that violist playing the quartet, the trout, and just hearing them just go at it, and we're like, whoa, it changed my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5112.143s">And</a>  I have so many memories and moments where somebody has done something poignant, somebody has said something poignant, where I'm like, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5122.62s">Thank</a>  you for that change of perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5126.462s">Thank</a>  you for that knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5127.963s">Thank</a>  you for opening up a door that I didn't even know was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5135.066s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5135.567s">I</a>  love learning about anything, especially things that make people happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5149.193s">What</a>  makes me happy? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5151.174s">My</a>  bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5154.301s">As</a>  Terry said, I am a conductor of the Loyal Field Harmonic. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5160.085s">And</a>  I actually created my own orchestra before I became conductor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5165.649s">I</a>  was going out on all these auditions to, you know, they're looking for a new conductor, looking for a new conductor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5171.673s">And</a>  I always came up number two, runner up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5176.036s">So</a>  I'm like, you want something different, but that's not what you're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5184.602s">You're</a>  getting the same thing, but 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5187.823s">So</a>  I'm like, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5189.764s">I</a>  have a network of musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5193.125s">Let</a>  me just create my own table and orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5196.366s">So</a>  I created the Cherry Hill Chamber Orchestra, and I run it the way I want to run it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5201.148s">I</a>  run it in a wholesome way, as in, leave your egos at the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5207.33s">There</a>  are no divas. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5209.61s">We're</a>  gonna play this for us, and then translate it to the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5214.764s">Let's</a>  first and foremost have fun with this music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5218.646s">I'm</a>  a conductor, but I'm not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5221.648s">I</a>  will make a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5224.25s">And</a>  I will own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5226.511s">I</a>  will own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5227.432s">Because</a>  I'm still learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5228.673s">I</a>  will never cease to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5231.214s">And</a>  my bliss is actually getting hit with all the music, with all the sounds, any of the sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5238.139s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5241.311s">People</a>  who know me, they know that I dance on the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5249.295s">My</a>  husband here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5251.056s">I</a>  dance on the podium because the music moves me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5254.417s">If</a>  music moves you, move. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5259.56s">And</a>  so I invite anyone at my concerts to not only <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5266.997s">clap</a>  in between movements, because you're just like, I need to emote what I just heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5273.944s">I've</a>  gone to symphony orchestra concerts before, and the orchestra has played a poignant piece, and I'm just like, I need to talk to somebody about this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5284.595s">Like,</a>  this is awesome, but everybody's like, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5297.873s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5299.094s">My</a>  concerts, I actually invite the audience to clap, to sigh, to close your eyes, to emote. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5308.722s">In</a>  between movements, to ask me a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5313.086s">I</a>  go out to the audience and I ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5316.529s">What</a>  did you hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5318.21s">How</a>  did that make you feel? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5322.312s">Then</a>  I turn to the orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5323.933s">Hey,</a>  can you play that thing that you did? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5327.036s">Now</a>  play it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5328.657s">And</a>  just have an interactive experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5331.279s">It's</a>  more entertaining that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5333.721s">Instead</a>  of just, you pay your ticket, sit, listen, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5337.884s">Like,</a>  no, that's boring to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5340.666s">So</a>  I like to do things a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5346.556s">Yes,</a>  Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, all the great things, but I also like working with living composers because I can talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5355.721s">I</a>  can talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5357.522s">And</a>  one of my favorite living composers, he lives in Danvers, his name is Charles Turner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5368.433s">Charles</a>  Turner, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5370.354s">And</a>  during COVID, when we were all in our house, twiddling our thumbs, there was this thing going on online, started here in Boston, actually, by a Boston symphony player. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5384.801s">It</a>  was called these musical minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5388.162s">So</a>  instrumentalists reached out to composers and said, can you compose a one minute piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5395.973s">And</a>  they would record it, put it online, and it was fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5399.755s">People</a>  were working, people were video, it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5402.617s">So</a>  I asked Charles Turner, because I love his music, I asked him, hey, can you, this is what's happening, can you create something for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5411.281s">And</a>  he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5411.722s">So</a>  I'm gonna play a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5414.983s">This</a>  one was the first thing that he created. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5417.065s">It</a>  was called The Minute Tango, aka The Lady Walks Away. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5546.966s">So</a>  in college, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Dr. Wesley Baldwin, he was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5555.652s">I</a>  loved him. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5557.874s">My</a>  first cello teacher, bless his heart, he, a developing body in high school, and he said, I don't know what to do with your body as it's developing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5572.784s">I'm</a>  like, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5577.075s">What's</a>  wrong with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5579.915s">He</a>  was good, but I was like, why are you telling me this? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5584.118s">But</a>  then I got to Dr. Baldwin, and his hands are huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5591.123s">His</a>  hand span is really big. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5593.966s">And</a>  he was like, he said, Marshanda, you have to do it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5596.608s">He</a>  speaks like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5598.209s">Marshanda,</a>  it's this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5599.69s">And</a>  I'm like, Dr. Baldwin, your hand is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5602.692s">I</a>  cannot stretch this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5604.594s">My</a>  body cannot do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5611.777s">Oh,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5613.562s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5615.929s">Let's</a>  try something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5620.888s">That's</a>  what I wanna hear from a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5623.61s">I</a>  don't want to hear, or no student should hear, your body is stopping you from doing what you would like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5633.177s">I</a>  want a teacher who's gonna say, I see and hear you, let's figure something else out so you can get to where you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5646.241s">I</a>  love him. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5648.342s">He's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5650.463s">And</a>  he was so inspirational that there was one time he was doing a recital. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5655.825s">I</a>  was so inspired. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5656.906s">I</a>  had to leave his recital, during his recital, to go practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5661.128s">It</a>  was so inspirational. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5663.269s">And</a>  teachers liked that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5664.69s">When</a>  I told him, he was like, why did you leave, Marsha? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5666.31s">And</a>  I was like, I was so inspired. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5668.851s">Like,</a>  I had to practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5669.892s">He</a>  was like, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5672.453s">Okay,</a>  I'll give you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5676.655s">He</a>  continues to be inspirational. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5678.196s">He</a>  just published a book of African, Latin, people of color collection of living composers and recently deceased composers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5693.862s">He</a>  just published it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5696.603s">He's</a>  not a person of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5699.525s">He's</a>  not a person of color, and yet he's like, there's so much out there that has been hidden, and it's wonderful, and I'm glad that he's an advocate to getting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5722.36s">When</a>  I was in college and going around town, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5728.001s">People</a>  would say, oh, you have such life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5730.962s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5731.543s">And</a>  I'm like, oh, I'm a musician. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5732.703s">They</a>  were like, oh, you sing gospel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5740.247s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5742.608s">Oh,</a>  jazz. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5748.61s">Your</a>  ignorance is showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5752.572s">No,</a>  I play the cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5754.013s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5756.704s">You</a>  know what a violin is? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5758.585s">Yeah,</a>  okay, it's big. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5766.549s">I</a>  even had one time someone tell me that I was too articulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5777.514s">Yeah,</a>  I was too articulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5783.457s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5786.291s">I'm</a>  too articulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5788.733s">My</a>  grandma was a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5794.037s">I</a>  love stories and I listen to how people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5800.942s">Aren't</a>  I clear? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5803.003s">Shouldn't</a>  everybody be clear if they're trying to communicate? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5807.847s">What</a>  does that mean, I'm too articulate? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5811.409s">That's</a>  their problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5814.255s">They</a>  haven't trained their ears to hear the articulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5817.696s">That's</a>  on you, babe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5821.218s">I</a>  left Knoxville and came to Maine because I started conducting in Knoxville, and I wanted to find a teacher that didn't have a big ego, because I didn't have time for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5839.389s">I</a>  really wanted to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5841.51s">And</a>  so I sent out an email to a lot of professors and universities, and I asked them one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5849.476s">When</a>  you are preparing a piece, do you prepare it according to the composer's wishes, dead composer's wishes, to the best of your ability, given that we have different instruments today, or do you do what you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5866.127s">So</a>  many conductors said, oh, they're dead, I do what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5871.109s">But</a>  my teacher up in Maine, Dr. Robert Lehman, he said, given today's period instruments, I will program things because I respect the composer and what he or she was trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5881.273s">I</a>  try to adhere to their wishes, adding my own little flair, and also taking into consideration today's modern instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5890.357s">I'm</a>  like, oh yes, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5892.298s">So</a>  you're bringing respect to the artist, the original artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5897.18s">I</a>  really dug that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5899.704s">And</a>  so I started working with him up in Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5901.705s">Maine</a>  is, when I went to Maine the first time, it was dark at four o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5910.387s">Now</a>  Chattanooga and Knoxville, we're on the same time zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5913.428s">And</a>  so I got here, I'm like, what is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5917.63s">And</a>  it was wet and muddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5921.391s">And</a>  so people in Maine was like, yeah, this is mud season. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5928.22s">And</a>  they're like, yeah, we're so far east on the eastern time zone that we should be in the other time zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5934.545s">I'm</a>  like, oh, okay, that's weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5937.327s">But</a>  I started, studied with Dr. Lehman in Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5941.911s">Got</a>  everything that I needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5944.253s">Everything</a>  that I needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5948.476s">But</a>  while I was up there, I was the conductor of a local youth orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5958.035s">And</a>  I loved it so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5963.378s">But</a>  things change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5965.019s">People</a>  evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5968.94s">People's</a>  egos get in the way and are threatened. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5976.184s">When</a>  that happens, I noticed that I started, it was a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5984.248s">Apparently</a>  I was intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5987.719s">just</a>  being, I was just intimidating, asking questions was intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=5993.082s">So</a>  I'm like, OK, all right, well, bye, Felicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6000.046s">You</a>  do you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6001.687s">I'm</a>  going to go over here and just continue to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6007.551s">I</a>  always try to learn from my experiences, whether they're good or bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6011.473s">I</a>  think it's a great thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6017.057s">Another</a>  piece that I want to play for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6027.407s">This</a>  composer lives in Gloucester. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6030.933s">Tom</a>  Fabonio, his wife, Mary Jane, is a cellist and she plays in my orchestra whenever I ask her. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6039.835s">And</a>  he's pretty popular in the UK, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6045.777s">But</a>  he creates and writes these pieces that I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6049.458s">like</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6050.159s">This</a>  one is called The First of Winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6052.803s">It's</a>  actually dedicated to a friend of ours, Judy, I just saw her today, and her husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6061.556s">So</a>  this is The First of Winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6243.228s">My</a>  first winter here in New England, very different from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6248.793s">I</a>  was sitting in the North Shore Philharmonic Orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6251.955s">This</a>  was 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6257.58s">And</a>  I had no clue that you all have no humidity during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6263.145s">No</a>  humidity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6264.506s">So</a>  I wasn't aware that <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6268.709s">It's</a>  going to do things to my cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6270.91s">I'm</a>  sitting in orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6271.95s">Doo,</a>  doo, doo, doo, doo. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6274.071s">I'm</a>  listening to the conductor talk about other things, because I'm a good student. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6278.772s">Because</a>  what he's saying over there across the orchestra may apply to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6284.113s">So</a>  I'm listening and being like, OK, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6286.954s">I'm</a>  like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6288.494s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, OK, yeah, we have that later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6291.155s">OK,</a>  and then just kind of look down at my cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6294.881s">And</a>  this neck right here was detached from the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6301.429s">It</a>  was like a person walking around with a broken neck. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6307.075s">And</a>  so I'm sitting there in orchestra, I'm going, oh! <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6312.205s">And</a>  it hadn't snapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6314.147s">It</a>  just had kind of came apart because it was just dry, dry, dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6318.692s">The</a>  wood was just dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6320.274s">However,</a>  I didn't notice it because the strings were still intact. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6323.758s">I</a>  was playing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6324.799s">I</a>  mean, this is a lot of pounds per square inch these strings are holding, but I stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6330.946s">I</a>  couldn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6332.387s">I</a>  was traumatized. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6333.787s">I've</a>  never seen that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6335.808s">And</a>  then they're like, you don't do a humidifier? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6339.349s">I'm</a>  like, what is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6340.289s">I</a>  come from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6341.569s">I</a>  live in the Smoky Mountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6343.61s">It's</a>  humidity everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6345.25s">They're</a>  like, yeah, Marshaunda, it's dry here. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6348.991s">And</a>  I'm like, what is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6352.814s">And</a>  that was a quick, hard lesson to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6357.997s">Thankfully,</a>  I actually got this cello up here in the Boston area from Rooning and Sons in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6365.42s">And</a>  they shipped it down to Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6366.761s">That</a>  was before I knew I was going to come up here to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6370.102s">So</a>  I was just like, fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6372.643s">And</a>  so they fixed my cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6374.964s">And</a>  then life went on and played and kept playing here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6381.92s">always</a>  trying to find my bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6387.804s">So</a>  I was trying to find my bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6391.006s">There</a>  was one time where I was actually homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6395.768s">I</a>  was actually homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6397.75s">I</a>  lived on people's couches. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6399.791s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6403.34s">Worked</a>  and drove to Maine for three days to Rockport, Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6409.404s">I</a>  drove there on Sunday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6414.928s">Stayed</a>  to Tuesday, came back down, stayed with some friends in Somerville for two days, some friends in Medford for two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6424.894s">One</a>  person in somewhere, Arlington, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6428.997s">And</a>  then rinse and repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6431.278s">My</a>  goal was to just keep working to pay off my car so I can continue to do music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6438.04s">I</a>  was having lessons on the side whenever I can, really just hustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6445.981s">Teachers</a>  don't make anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6448.262s">Teachers</a>  don't make anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6451.922s">And</a>  there was one time where I was tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6456.603s">I</a>  had gotten my degree and I'm like, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6460.057s">At</a>  this moment, I was house cleaning in the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6463.678s">I</a>  made bank, house cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6466.599s">That</a>  was very lucrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6468.9s">But</a>  that's not what I wanted to do, even though I could have kept going and actually bought a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6477.442s">I</a>  was like, this is not what I want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6481.083s">I</a>  want to wake up every morning and be like, I'm going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6485.184s">feed</a>  my soul somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6487.605s">So</a>  I decided to go back down to Tennessee because the cost of living is much lower, much lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6496.187s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6498.048s">And</a>  so at that time, I was also on the board of the North Shore Philharmonic and one of the board members, I told the board members, I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna go back to Tennessee and I'm just, I'm tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6511.211s">I</a>  don't wanna do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6514.432s">And</a>  one of the board members said, well, Marshanda, I have a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6518.154s">I'm</a>  like, good for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6520.296s">He's</a>  like, well, it's my mom's house. <a

href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6531.542s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6533.343s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6535.436s">um</a>  where's your where's

strangers, I can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6577.36s">He</a>  was like, no, you don't have to pay, just pay for your utilities, just be in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6586.814s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6589.108s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6590.709s">So</a>  blessings come in all different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6595.79s">I</a>  stayed there for about four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6598.831s">I</a>  paid off two student loans. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6600.832s">I</a>  was not going to let that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6604.333s">I</a>  took advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6606.894s">I</a>  took care of bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6609.015s">I</a>  put my car back in working order. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6612.116s">I</a>  did some more networking, got some more education. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6615.517s">I</a>  fully took advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6618.458s">because</a>  not too many people have that gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6623.499s">Oh</a>  yeah, at that time, thank you, I started No Name Orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6628.16s">So</a>  I had the mental capacity and mental space to start things and actually start my path of finding my bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6636.862s">And</a>  I started Waldorf at the same time that I moved into that house in Waldorf School. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6646.3s">was</a>  very close to my school, Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, where they just said, Marshaunda, we just want you to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6662.467s">You</a>  want me to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6663.628s">They're</a>  like, yeah, the kids need to see different people just be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6672.322s">Oh,</a>  and for the first time in my life, I felt, wow, this is an organization that was not created for someone who looked like me, but they're saying, just exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6689.787s">I</a>  felt so great to be amongst people that are just like, come as you are, like wholly come as you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6701.969s">And</a>  let's collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6703.37s">Bring</a>  your skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6704.79s">What</a>  can you teach my kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6706.53s">What</a>  can I learn from you? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6707.651s">And</a>  I'm like, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6709.351s">We</a>  could collaborate? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6710.151s">I</a>  can learn from you? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6710.911s">You</a>  can learn from me? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6712.011s">And</a>  there's like no ego in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6714.392s">Like</a>  if I ask you a question, I'm not challenging you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6717.313s">I</a>  honestly want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6720.691s">They're</a>  like, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6722.751s">I</a>  loved it, I loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6724.432s">I</a>  went on and got actually a certificate in Waldorf Music Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6729.115s">I'm</a>  now teaching Waldorf teachers in a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6732.397s">I'm</a>  going down to Virginia to actually, to look at some other teachers and evaluate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6740.301s">So</a>  I'm in the Waldorf movement because they are the first organization that just allowed me to be as a black girl. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6751.307s">And</a>  I loved it, and that allowed me to flourish and find my bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6756.15s">I</a>  did no name, went on so many auditions, meeting people, and life is fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6764.934s">Life</a>  is fun when you meet these people, when you actually sit down and have these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6770.197s">How</a>  did you get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6771.237s">What</a>  do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6772.258s">Why</a>  did you choose that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6773.979s">And</a>  not be offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6777.446s">when</a>  somebody asks you that, because it could be somebody just like me who just actually is interested in people in the world and your walk of life, and they actually want to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6790.432s">We</a>  always say, oh, you should learn from our mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6793.613s">Oh,</a>  I'm taking that to heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6796.535s">What</a>  wisdom can you impart on me? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6799.876s">And</a>  thank you for your gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6802.918s">It's</a>  fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6807.185s">It's</a>  fun, I try to eliminate as much drama as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6810.849s">God,</a>  I don't have time for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6812.971s">Nobody</a>  got time for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6814.652s">And</a>  I definitely do hold my boundaries because there's only one life to live and I'm loving all the beautiful things that come at me and all the beautiful people that I learn from, all the new doors in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6832.469s">in</a>  my head that are opened because I ask people questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6837.333s">And</a>  so when it comes to pieces that I'm playing, I love to ask the composers, why did you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6847.722s">Not</a>  as, you know, why'd you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6852.005s">But</a>  just like, what's going through your mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6855.811s">My</a>  professor, Dr. Baldwin, when I was back in undergraduate school, he was, I was studying the Brahms cello sonata in E minor, and he asked me, he was like, Marshana, do you know what this is about? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6866.176s">I'm</a>  like, no, I'm just playing the notes, because you told me to, you're my teacher, I'm just gonna do that, you know, I'm a good student. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6871.698s">He</a>  was like, you should look up what's going on with this, and I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6876.8s">And</a>  he wrote this cello sonata after the passing of his mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6882.163s">And</a>  I was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6883.939s">That</a>  makes sense now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6886.461s">Oh,</a>  and after realizing that, I played it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6894.549s">Because</a>  I played it with a heavy heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6897.992s">I</a>  played it as condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6902.136s">And</a>  it changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6905.162s">how</a>  I look at music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6907.363s">It's</a>  more than notes on a pape. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6910.704s">Same</a>  way I treat people, like, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6913.885s">Like,</a>  how did you get to be who you are, what you are today? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6917.626s">What's</a>  the inner meaning of the soul of this piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6921.488s">What's</a>  the joy of this piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6923.508s">And</a>  even if I come to a piece that doesn't have a history, <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6930.467s">I</a>  have a vivid imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6932.048s">Well,</a>  what is it telling me? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6933.489s">What</a>  am I imagining? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6935.25s">Because</a>  I want to tell this story to the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6938.552s">And</a>  if the audience sees that this is a sad part or a happy part, I need to relay that as a performer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6945.117s">I</a>  want to bring them into the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6947.779s">And</a>  when I'm talking to people, I want to come into you so I can figure out what makes you move? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6956.705s">As</a>  a human being, we all move differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6959.086s">What</a>  makes you move? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6961.807s">So</a>  I'm looking at the time and it is nine o'clock so we're right at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6965.949s">I</a>  know it's more talking than playing but I'm gonna play one more thing and I invite everybody to sit down and have coffee with your neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6981.433s">When's</a>  the last time you actually sat down with your neighbor and just had coffee? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6991.11s">just</a>  talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6993.652s">What</a>  were you doing in 1980? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6997.194s">What</a>  was that year like for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=6998.395s">And</a>  just have a conversation and just listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7002.438s">It's</a>  fascinating, people's journeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7005.68s">At</a>  least I find it fascinating. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7008.061s">Like</a>  I said at the beginning, I learned so much about myself and the world around me and pieces of the world that I may not touch, but I learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7025.983s">I'm</a>  going to do, see I already did the tango, ah. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7036.411s">This</a>  is another Charles Turner special. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7038.893s">It's</a>  from his minute pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7041.034s">This</a>  is A Minute of Crazy Love.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7051.758s">Love</a>  makes me light as air. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7073.963s">I</a>  jump up and down, but I don't come down.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7105.224s">Climbing</a>  hills is easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7132.208s">Love</a>  makes me sing opera. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7170.832s">Love</a>  is like swimming down a waterfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7179.778s">Or</a>  up a waterfall.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7201.317s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, brown girl at the cello, Marshaunda Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7205.359s">Thank</a>  you so much, Marshaunda. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7206.76s">That</a>  was just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7208.361s">I</a>  think we learned so much in such a brief period of time about your motivations, about what makes you tick when you're maybe standing with your baton in front of your orchestra or when you're sitting down as a player in an orchestra with your cello. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7227.25s">whose</a>  neck is no longer broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7229.051s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7232.714s">So</a>  just have a few things to share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7240.686s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen of the West Medford Senior Club, we'll be hosting an afternoon tea and fundraiser on March 16th from 2 to 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7253.033s">Join</a>  them or us for tea and fun and entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7257.736s">Tickets</a>  are only $20 and you will really, really enjoy yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7262.639s">It's</a>  something that they do every year and it's always a really, really good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7267.861s">So</a>  avail yourself of the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7271.583s">I</a>  know that usually Florence has tickets, Rachel has tickets, maybe Shirley has tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7276.565s">There's</a>  tickets in the building, so if you're interested, you can definitely go. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7281.467s">We've</a>  been hosting, through Medford Connects, a black health series, and we had our first event on February 21st, cardiovascular health. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7291.911s">The</a>  second event is on March 27th, and it's Alzheimer's in the black community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7297.993s">So</a>  that full spectrum, you know, from mild dementia all the way through full-blown Alzheimer's will be talked about and discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7307.339s">You'll</a>  be able to get questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7309.94s">So</a>  I think it would be a good opportunity for folks to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7313.462s">And</a>  that will be here at the community center March 27th from 5 to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7321.107s">So</a>  if you're interested in the community center and what makes us tick and how we keep ticking, you can certainly go online to wmcc.us or you can call us at 781-483-3042 for more information or <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7340.074s">This</a>  is important, to become a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7342.657s">And</a>  elders, if you're interested, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship, that cup of coffee and conversation that you were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7357.114s">They've</a>  gotten extremely good at it, as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7360.337s">So</a>  we serve lunch at 12 noon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7363.058s">And</a>  please join us in April, toward the end of April, and we'll be posting more information about this for our upcoming community legislative forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7375.782s">We</a>  do it every year, and nobody does it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7380.563s">Your</a>  tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7385.326s">Partner</a>  with us in carrying this mission forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7388.027s">Please</a>  consider making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/EyA6JwiAVB8&t=7394.35s">On</a>  behalf of Lisa Crossman, our board of directors, I want to thank so much Dr. Sheila E.
