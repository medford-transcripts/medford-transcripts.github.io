1
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I need my glasses, I'll be right back.

2
00:03:59,648 --> 00:03:59,728
do

3
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,214
the guitar.

4
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

5
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:50,862
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

6
00:05:51,402 --> 00:06:01,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another live edition of First Friday's Words and Music, or as we call it when we're not on the first Friday, Flex Friday's Words and Music.

7
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:13,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to be following up a great Black History Month program with another special offering in celebration of women's history across the United States.

8
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:23,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are ready to roll again at 111 Arlington Street.

9
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:32,987
[SPEAKER_01]: As ever, I want to remind you that COVID is still a thing, and we're still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

10
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So masking is welcomed, but not required.

11
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:45,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just happy to be sponsoring live programming here at WMCC and glad to see our neighbors, our friends and supporters coming through the doors.

12
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for being here.

13
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:59,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks also to Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media channels nine for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

14
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:09,756
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're out there watching on your electronic devices, your 60 inch screens, whatever it might be, welcome to the show.

15
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:26,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my travels as a poet and as an ambassador for the arts, I've been privileged to encounter some tremendous teachers, leaders, and history makers across a wide panorama of human endeavor.

16
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Words and music has given me that opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention.

17
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight is no exception, so I hope you're ready for something really special.

18
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:46,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest for this portion of the evening's program is my friend and a woman who can truly be considered a history maker.

19
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you a bit about her.

20
00:07:49,144 --> 00:08:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Sheila E. Nutt, two Ts, is a Newton resident and a former director of educational outreach programs for Harvard Medical School's Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Partnership.

21
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:08,769
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife, Teresa, worked with her for a number of years, and we met through that relationship.

22
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:31,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Our paths crossed on a regular basis as I volunteered annually for a community-based student engagement event called Reflection in Action, a program that examined health disparities in the inner city and brought together students for greater agency and understanding in combating these inequities.

23
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:37,051
[SPEAKER_01]: That program, in and of itself, could certainly be considered history-making.

24
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:49,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, Dr. Sheila, as she has been known affectionately by closest and dearest, made history long before her tenure at Harvard, a tenure which she retired from several years ago.

25
00:08:50,478 --> 00:09:01,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1970, Sheila Nutt became one of the first African-American flight attendants working for Pan American World Airways.

26
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:07,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 50 years have passed since Sheila helped make that history.

27
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:15,997
[SPEAKER_01]: She was part of the first wave of African-American women hired as stewardesses, as they were called back then.

28
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:22,899
[SPEAKER_01]: A half century ago, flight crews were mainly white, as were the passengers.

29
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,305
[SPEAKER_01]: After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, airlines had to start hiring people of color.

30
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:39,274
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1969, when Dr. Sheila was 20 years old and living in Philadelphia, she heard Pan Am was hiring and wanted in.

31
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:47,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's explore that history with Sheila, but make sure your tray tables are locked and your seats are in the upright position.

32
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:50,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and there might be some turbulence ahead.

33
00:09:51,761 --> 00:10:11,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a piece of verse that I shared with Dr. Sheila several years ago when she was doing some work on her program involving her colleagues and her history with PNM.

34
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:16,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And that piece of poetry is called Song of the Blackbirds.

35
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,643
[SPEAKER_01]: We are called the Blackbirds.

36
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a ring that speaks to our natural woman thing.

37
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:35,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Pin M said yes and got the best as chocolate doves embraced the test.

38
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Not willowy blondes or buxom brunettes.

39
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We Blackbirds flew beyond regrets.

40
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:47,815
[SPEAKER_01]: We filled those uniforms just as well and answered that lofty airborne bell.

41
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:55,500
[SPEAKER_01]: To serve with dignity and distinction, service like this is close to extinction.

42
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,584
[SPEAKER_01]: 35,000 feet in the air, we were a flight crew beyond compare, telling the nations we weren't just white.

43
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Through work and worth, we all took flight.

44
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:09,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Ebony, tan, and caramel sweet, lovely sisters.

45
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:11,270
[SPEAKER_01]: whole and complete.

46
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:21,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Though attitude might be detected, we made our flyers feel safe and respected, rising above the scorn and disdain, striving to make our excellence plain.

47
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:26,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the well-to-do flew with us, and rich folks really make a fuss.

48
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,217
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to be humble right from the start.

49
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to be pretty, resourceful, and smart.

50
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nurses, we treated our patients well, even the ones that gave us hell.

51
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:46,229
[SPEAKER_01]: The smallest kindnesses we would make, like mixing a traveler's cold milkshake or fluffing the pillow of a boar whose ignorance we must endure.

52
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet class and dignity ruled the day.

53
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the enduring Blackbird way.

54
00:11:52,333 --> 00:12:02,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Traveling the globe on speeding jets, circling the world as good as it gets, exploring exotic ports of call, winter and spring, summer and fall.

55
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:08,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Aboard that luxury 747, just a whisper away from heaven.

56
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:12,810
[SPEAKER_01]: We show white folks a grace unknown in all the flights they'd ever flown.

57
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Pan Am said, yes, let's give them wings.

58
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,275
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see just what their color brings.

59
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:26,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Just call us Blackbirds and hear the ring that speaks to a sister's natural swing.

60
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, call us Blackbirds.

61
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:29,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that ring.

62
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It speaks to our natural woman thing.

63
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:34,726
Woo!

64
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:35,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Give her a hand!

65
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh!

66
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:37,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

67
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:38,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

68
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:41,409
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

69
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say something.

70
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:43,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Dive in.

71
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blackbirds, a group that I founded in 1918, we had a gathering of Blackbirds at Harvard Medical School.

72
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:03,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I called upon my wordsmith friend,

73
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:21,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Terry to bring a little class, a little more class to the event and see if he could create a poem for us and this is what he came up with and I think it's fabulous and I think he deserves another round of applause.

74
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:28,925
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's dive right into this.

75
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:37,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Shill, you've done a number of interviews with the news media, including WBUR and CNN, among others.

76
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:44,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always locked in on your pursuit of the opportunity to work with Pan Am as a 20-year-old college graduate.

77
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about your initial interview with Pan Am?

78
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go back just a little bit.

79
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:58,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls in 1966.

80
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the math, okay, and figure out how old I am.

81
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:09,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the only exam school for girls in Philadelphia at the time.

82
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:14,927
[SPEAKER_03]: There were very few of us women of color or young girls of color at that time.

83
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were all programmed to go to college, post high school.

84
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:33,602
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when we were encouraged or when we had the interviews and the conversations with our guidance counselors, many of us were told, oh, you're going to make a fabulous

85
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:36,305
[SPEAKER_03]: dental hygienists.

86
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:41,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to make a fabulous beauty parlor somebody or another.

87
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:49,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we went home to our parents and said, you know, this is what they're guiding us towards,

88
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:54,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Our parents were like, oh, no, that's not how we roll.

89
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us were third generation college graduates who had been to HBCUs.

90
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,555
[SPEAKER_03]: They were professionals.

91
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, oh, no, no, that's not how we roll.

92
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I always wanted to be an actress.

93
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: In 66, I wanted to be a ballerina.

94
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:22,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was told that there was no future for a black ballerina.

95
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:27,874
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just the beginning of the dance companies like Alvin Ailey.

96
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I believed that.

97
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, I'm going to be an actress and a model.

98
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,015
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I do that?

99
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So I entered the Miss America contest in Philadelphia.

100
00:15:42,490 --> 00:16:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1968, I was the only black to enter the contest, and that particular contest was the first step towards getting to the main Miss America contest that takes place in September in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

101
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I prepared, I was excited, and I was thinking, oh boy, if I win, I'm gonna get discovered, and I will go to Hollywood, and oh, I was just, I had it.

102
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:28,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the evening came, I was prepared, and I was one of the few participants standing as they were calling who was the winner.

103
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:34,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did third runner-up, second runner-up, and I'm still standing.

104
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's a chance.

105
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:41,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they came to first runner-up, and that was my name.

106
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:46,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little pissed, but you know, I'm black.

107
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy for first runner-up.

108
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they announced the queen.

109
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:55,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we all took photographs, and we were happy and bubbly.

110
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're leaving the venue,

111
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,122
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the judges came to my parents and me and asked if they could talk to my mother in private.

112
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:18,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They pulled her over to the side and they said, we were unanimous in our choice of the queen.

113
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:26,650
[SPEAKER_03]: We really wanted Sheila to win, but we weren't ready for a black queen.

114
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that sink in a minute.

115
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,189
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't ready for a black queen.

116
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because my talent wasn't good enough.

117
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:49,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because I didn't answer the questions professionally.

118
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of the color of my skin that God had given me.

119
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was a little annoyed.

120
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little angry.

121
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:16,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And what really was happening here was if anything had happened to the queen, I would become queen by default.

122
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:20,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

123
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:30,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get, no.

124
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:34,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I was happy to be first runner up.

125
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:44,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just so happened that the person who was Miss Congeniality, she said, Sheila, I know you want to be discovered.

126
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,247
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, the airlines are hiring.

127
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll get discovered on an airplane.

128
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:51,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, okay, fine.

129
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend Sandy and I were, you know, this is the 60s.

130
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:03,892
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Vietnam War, this is Roe versus Wade, this is burn your bra, this is, you know, Kent State.

131
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,173
[SPEAKER_03]: This is tumultuous times.

132
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:07,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Contraceptives.

133
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, so we were really active, for lack of a better word.

134
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:17,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sandy and I looked in the

135
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:35,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday newspaper that's where you know, that's the equivalent of Craigslist So you look in the Sunday paper in the one at section and so we looked under airlines and the only airlines we saw was Pan American World Airways

136
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sandy and I said, well, let's go for it.

137
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We called up for an interview date.

138
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:48,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lady said, before we can give you an interview date, you have to pass certain requirements.

139
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:54,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to be a certain height, a certain weight, no eyeglasses, no braces, no acne.

140
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was just a bunch of no's.

141
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:00,227
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you had to be college educated.

142
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to have a second language.

143
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to be at least 21, not married, no kids.

144
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:08,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's on and on.

145
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So we said, okay, we're fine.

146
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,041
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an interview date.

147
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And the two of us went down to a local hotel.

148
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we entered the reception area, it was filled with the most beautiful women that you could ever see.

149
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:33,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Sandy and I were the only women that looked like us in the room.

150
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:41,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither of us knew about Pan Am because Pan American at the time was strictly international.

151
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:49,080
[SPEAKER_03]: African Americans, people of color, were going from Detroit to L.A., L.A.

152
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,904
[SPEAKER_03]: to Miami, but we weren't going from New York to Paris.

153
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,246
[SPEAKER_03]: We just weren't, okay?

154
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:04,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I sat there waiting for my interview, I read the brochure.

155
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at the brochure and I said, Paris?

156
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Istanbul?

157
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:12,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Around the world?

158
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:14,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

159
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted that job more than I wanted to become Miss America.

160
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: As quiet as it's kept.

161
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sat there and I want to make this very clear.

162
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:35,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat there and I visualized myself on that airplane

163
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted that job badly.

164
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:49,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was called into the interview room, and I was told to have a seat, and we had a conversation.

165
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:55,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question of everybody was, why do you want to be a flight attendant?

166
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We were stewardesses at the time.

167
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you want to be a stewardess?

168
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the answer was, I love people.

169
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love people.

170
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was asked some questions in my language, which was Spanish.

171
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I had taken four years of Spanish at high school and a year of Italian in college.

172
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was fairly competent in Spanish.

173
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:28,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great accent, but I didn't know anything about subjunctive.

174
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:34,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know anything about conditional, but I can work present and past tense, okay?

175
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:38,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly what I did then, okay?

176
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:42,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned the interview around to present and past tense.

177
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,521
[SPEAKER_03]: With my accent.

178
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:49,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he said, walk across the room.

179
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:52,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew how to walk.

180
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So I walked across the room.

181
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:59,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he said, well, thank you very much, Ms.

182
00:22:59,318 --> 00:22:59,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutt.

183
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get in touch with you.

184
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,108
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, if you're selected to go to the next level,

185
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:16,072
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll get a telegram, and telegram is 1960 text message, okay?

186
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:25,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he walked me to the door and he says, and the next time you go for an interview, make sure you're not chewing gum.

187
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:34,925
[SPEAKER_03]: What had happened when I was nervous, I put a small piece of gum into my mouth to freshen my breath.

188
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go into an interview with funky breath.

189
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:40,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So I forgot to take it out.

190
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could just imagine I must have been sitting there

191
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:48,570
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nervous as a cow, chewing on my cud.

192
00:23:49,511 --> 00:24:01,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, to make a long story short, I got the telegram, and I was told I passed that, and I had to take a medical exam and an eye exam.

193
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:07,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I think you teased it a little bit, but I want to hone in on it.

194
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,961
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the attraction for you in trying to become a stewardess?

195
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get discovered.

196
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get discovered.

197
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:22,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beauty here is that I wanted to be an actress.

198
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to be a model.

199
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:36,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And back in the day, in the 60s, becoming a model and an actress required for

200
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:40,787
[SPEAKER_03]: young girls to make certain choices.

201
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:59,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I believe God did not allow me to become a model or an actress when I was a 20-something because he had a different plan for me.

202
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:02,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And so

203
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:13,730
[SPEAKER_03]: His plan for me was to retire from Harvard Medical School and not Hollywood.

204
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me, Sheila, you will be a fabulous actress and a model, but you've got to wait 50 years.

205
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say wait 50 years because I have two Wayfair commercials.

206
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:34,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done commercials for stop and shop.

207
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:39,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done commercials for Star Market.

208
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:49,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I can go for an interview or for a work that I

209
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:53,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strictly my credentials.

210
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

211
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this face.

212
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:58,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this face.

213
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,340
[SPEAKER_01]: How could she not be successful?

214
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

215
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So training classes that prepared you to get on that plane, what were they like?

216
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:15,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, like I said, Pan Am was strictly international.

217
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:28,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, Pan American World Airways passengers were diplomats, heads of state, heads of major corporations and organizations.

218
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were trained to be hostesses.

219
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:34,095
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trained to be hospitable.

220
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trained in emergency to keep our passengers safe.

221
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: We were encouraged to read.

222
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We were encouraged to be able to carry on a conversation with heads of state, with diplomats, with international people.

223
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:56,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We were required to take language

224
00:26:57,861 --> 00:27:07,648
[SPEAKER_03]: to learn as many languages as possible so that we could speak to our passengers in whatever language they spoke.

225
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I was eventually qualified in Spanish and Swahili.

226
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:17,274
[SPEAKER_03]: because I wanted to travel to Africa.

227
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:20,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to travel to Kenya and Tanzania.

228
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So I learned how to speak Swahili.

229
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:29,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Pan American at the time was very slow during the winter months.

230
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:37,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would encourage us to take unpaid leaves of absence and travel around the world.

231
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:40,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We could travel for free to Fiji.

232
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,180
[SPEAKER_03]: to London.

233
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:58,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really concerned because my husband, who is, I can't tell where he's from, but anyway, when we were married, I said, well, let's go to London, or no, let's go to Rome for dinner.

234
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:01,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sheila, I'm scared to fly.

235
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:04,816
[SPEAKER_03]: If I go anywhere, I've got to stay for a few days.

236
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:15,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, the beauty of being a stewardess is to be able to travel at the drop of a hat, go for dinner, stay overnight, and come back home.

237
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:20,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So he really wasn't able to take advantage of the travel benefits.

238
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:24,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, we were trained to be hostesses.

239
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:27,510
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine was on an airplane

240
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:42,101
[SPEAKER_03]: domestic flight and he was sitting in first class and he said the stewardess, the flight attendant, came to him and said, oh, would you like red wine or white wine?

241
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:47,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, well, what kind of wine is it?

242
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,648
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't even know the label of the wine.

243
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: We were sommeliers.

244
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,121
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew where the wine came from.

245
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew what it was paired with.

246
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We cooked food on the airplane.

247
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:05,485
[SPEAKER_03]: We served caviar.

248
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:22,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Flying first class in Pan Am was like traveling on a first-class five-star restaurant.

249
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:28,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Maxim's, the restaurant, was our caterer in first class.

250
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:30,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, wow.

251
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:33,146
[SPEAKER_01]: So when did you start flying?

252
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were those early flights like for you?

253
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:43,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was hired in 1969, but I had to finish school.

254
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:50,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I did finish that May, they didn't have a training class.

255
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said, we are bringing the 747.

256
00:29:55,137 --> 00:30:05,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will need to train people starting in January because the 747 was going to be part of the Pan Am fleet in 1970.

257
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started training school in January 12, 1970.

258
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only African American in my class.

259
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were some women in the class who had never seen an African American in person.

260
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:38,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what they knew about African Americans was what they saw in the news media, what they read in Life magazine, there was no People magazine then, or what they were told by family and friends, and it wasn't always true.

261
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:40,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

262
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it kind of dovetails into my next question.

263
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:49,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you experience racism, and how did it come to you?

264
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:52,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Racism.

265
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:53,255
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

266
00:30:53,855 --> 00:31:01,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So in training school, everybody was nice because you wanted to keep your job, OK?

267
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:13,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And stewardesses were supposed to be nice people, hospitable and very nice, compassionate, you know, getting along with people.

268
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So in training school, it wasn't a problem.

269
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:18,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was nice, OK?

270
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pan American encouraged their employees from stewardesses to people who took care of the airplane, who brought the food on the airplane.

271
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:35,710
[SPEAKER_03]: They were encouraged to embrace and respect diversity.

272
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very proud to be part of Pan American because that was the beginning of my

273
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:51,655
[SPEAKER_03]: introduction to the value and importance and what diversity does for everybody.

274
00:31:53,076 --> 00:32:00,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of training school, my training class was assigned.

275
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:11,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So since the two women who I had roomed with during training school were based in Miami, we said, why don't we continue and get an apartment together?

276
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:14,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounded nice.

277
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:14,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

278
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:26,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So the three of us looked in the Sunday newspaper under apartments, and we found a list of apartments that we were going to check out.

279
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:35,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The first apartment we went to, the landlord said, I don't rent to Puerto Ricans.

280
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:39,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

281
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:41,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't Puerto Rican.

282
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,661
[SPEAKER_03]: We said, OK, cool.

283
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,882
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the next place.

284
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That landlord said, you want me to put a Negro in my apartment?

285
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:00,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, come on, let's go.

286
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:08,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So the third place we went to, the lady was very nice.

287
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: She says, oh, I'm so sorry.

288
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,391
[SPEAKER_03]: We just rented that apartment.

289
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:15,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

290
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:22,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of my roommates, I won't mention her name because I've done it before and I made the wrong, I said the wrong name.

291
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:25,880
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my roommates looked at me and said, Sheila,

292
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:29,618
[SPEAKER_03]: we would have an apartment if it wasn't for you.

293
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, and I'm going to live with her?

294
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:44,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we didn't have an apartment, but we did have time still in the hotel where we were staying.

295
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:50,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So one day, I was at the airport, and I saw a woman in a Pan Am uniform

296
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:57,717
[SPEAKER_03]: with an afro out to here and I ran over to her and I said, where do you live?

297
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:06,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she told me, and it happened to be an apartment complex where a lot of airline people were living.

298
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we, the three of us, were able to get an apartment there.

299
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want, no, I'm not gonna say that.

300
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:26,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we got an apartment, and this woman who said we would have an apartment if it wasn't for you, didn't pass the training period.

301
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:31,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Comma is a... Yes.

302
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:32,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Comma.

303
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

304
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

305
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:34,785
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

306
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,046
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

307
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: What privileges do you feel you gained from your experiences as a stewardess with PNAM?

308
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:45,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Privilege.

309
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:52,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the privilege of traveling the world.

310
00:34:53,436 --> 00:35:00,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the privilege of seeing countries that I had only read about in history books.

311
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:03,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And I must admit, Terry,

312
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It did make me wish that I'd paid more attention in school to some of the world history courses that I had.

313
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the privilege.

314
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Egypt in 1972.

315
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:28,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a leave of absence from Pan Am, and I traveled around the continent of Africa looking for my roots.

316
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:36,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember with Pan American, I could travel first class for $25.

317
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.

318
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was only part of Africa.

319
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:49,350
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of Africa and Europe that would get me to these different places was Alitalia Airline, and I had to pay $125 to travel around the Alitalia network.

320
00:35:55,234 --> 00:36:10,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So I remember going to Athens and there was I was from Athens I was gonna go on to Egypt and Ethiopia and I met another stewardess from Air Canada I think and she says oh I

321
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:15,146
[SPEAKER_03]: why don't you join me and we're driving to Rome.

322
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, no, no, no, no, I'm going to Egypt.

323
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:20,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I don't think you should do that.

324
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, look, I've always wanted to see the pyramids.

325
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I have always wanted to see the Nile.

326
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:28,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Egypt.

327
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:31,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to Egypt, and I had a lovely time.

328
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:36,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I must admit, I was terribly disappointed in the Nile.

329
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:42,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I was expecting to see little baby boys in little baskets, and that didn't happen.

330
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like the, it looked like the Charles is quite a kid, okay?

331
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But the pyramids, it was fabulous.

332
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 20-something at the time with a short afro and hipsters and, you know, short

333
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:04,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Tops were in vogue, and that's what I was wearing.

334
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:14,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not educated, not respectful of the culture where women are supposed to be covered, but it was hot.

335
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:22,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt I was, it was okay to dress the way I wanted to, but it wasn't.

336
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:32,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was an elderly gentleman in the place where I had breakfast who said, oh, Sheila, you catch cold, you should,

337
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,872
[SPEAKER_03]: cover yourself here.

338
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:36,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me some fabric.

339
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was smart enough to take the hint.

340
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:48,578
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that time in 1972, Egyptian women were not traveling by themselves.

341
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:50,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was an anomaly.

342
00:37:50,698 --> 00:37:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus, Egypt and America weren't friends at that time either.

343
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was an anomaly.

344
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:01,205
[SPEAKER_03]: in Egypt at the time, and so people stared at me, okay?

345
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:22,342
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when I went to Ethiopia, I blended in, and I fell in love with Ethiopia, so much so that I decided I was gonna come back and get an education as a teacher, find an Ethiopian husband, and come back to Ethiopia and open a school where I wanted to live.

346
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:24,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

347
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:31,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Took me 13 years to find that Ethiopian man, and I found him right over in Mattapan.

348
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent 10 years raising our children in Ethiopia, and we've been together 39 years.

349
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:48,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And the daughters are beautiful.

351
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:50,328
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like their mama.

352
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

353
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

354
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,753
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so fast forward.

355
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:58,196
[SPEAKER_01]: You finished up with Pan Am when?

356
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:58,196
86.

357
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,959
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

358
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:05,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you go directly to Harvard from Pan Am?

359
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I left Pan Am, I had finished my doctorate in education at Boston University and I did my dissertation on stress and flight attendants.

360
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:25,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I started a business called Flight Attendant Network where I

361
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:29,063
[SPEAKER_03]: taught people how to get hired with the airlines.

362
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:36,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I provided a stress management program for stewardesses or flight attendants.

363
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if they weren't happy, I provided workshops on outplacement.

364
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:48,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you weren't happy as a stewardess, let's find another job.

365
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I do believe

366
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,940
[SPEAKER_03]: in work-life balance.

367
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:06,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people stay at a job, and there were stewardesses who stayed at the job for the paycheck and for the travel benefits, and they were miserable, and they made their passengers miserable.

368
00:40:06,892 --> 00:40:11,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so my theory was you don't have to be miserable.

369
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,016
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another job for you.

370
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another place where you can find joy.

371
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:21,621
[SPEAKER_03]: When you travel now, look at the faces of those flight attendants who are serving you.

372
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,942
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's some joy.

373
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:29,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just think people should find joy in their jobs.

374
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:30,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.

375
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:46,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I left Pan Am and I worked with a non-profit organization in Boston that resettled Ethiopian refugees and refugees from around the world because this was the height of the famine in Ethiopia.

376
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:53,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was when there was fighting throughout Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, et cetera.

377
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were doing that.

378
00:40:56,247 --> 00:41:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I worked at Emanuel College as the Director of Multicultural Affairs there.

379
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:13,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And while at Emanuel, I was curious about how refugee women were adjusting to America.

380
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of these refugee women had walked from Ethiopia to Sudan.

381
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them from other parts of Africa had walked from their country to refugee camps.

382
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, I got students over here that can't walk from, you know, Mattapan to Dudley Station, okay?

383
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of these women had been raped.

384
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:43,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

385
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:50,516
[SPEAKER_03]: They landed in their refugee camps pregnant and they didn't know who the father of that child was.

386
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:55,459
[SPEAKER_03]: They finally got to America and this was very different for them.

387
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:04,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I asked these women, why aren't you involved in negative dysfunctional behavior?

388
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:10,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the person, their answer was, I can't.

389
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,157
[SPEAKER_03]: my religion.

390
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:24,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I would disrespect my parents if I took drugs, if I became an alcoholic.

391
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:26,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

392
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So I began to look at what is the role of religion in maintaining culture and maintaining

393
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:38,738
[SPEAKER_03]: wholeness.

394
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:55,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then I pursued a master's in theological studies from Harvard Divinity School, where I looked at the role of women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo religion, Christianity.

395
00:42:56,166 --> 00:43:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I may just inform our listeners, Ethiopia has been practicing Christianity since 325 AD.

396
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first person that the Apostle Philip baptized

397
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:21,570
[SPEAKER_03]: was an Ethiopian eunuch when Philip was on his way to Pentecost.

398
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethiopia is mentioned over 38 times in the Bible.

399
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:26,351
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

400
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:30,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was curious about this religion, and so that's what I did.

401
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:36,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at the Ethiopian church at Harvard and the role of women.

402
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:42,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And fortunately, I was able to go back to Ethiopia

403
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: once the communist government had been overthrown, and we were able to raise our children there, and the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the late Abuna Paulos, may his soul rest in peace,

404
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: had been here in Boston area as a refugee and finished his master's and a PhD here in America.

405
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure, I think one was at Yale and another one was at Princeton.

406
00:44:15,606 --> 00:44:25,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted to bring the Ethiopian church, the Ethiopian culture into the, he wanted to move them forward.

407
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, Sheila,

408
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:35,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like for you to teach at the school where we train our priests.

409
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:45,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very excited because I'm basically an educator and I have this background in religion and African-American studies.

410
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: My first degree was in African-American studies.

411
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So I taught at the school for one semester because the

412
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:10,254
[SPEAKER_03]: bishops and the other priests said it was blasphemy for a female to teach priests, potential priests.

413
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my experience there.

414
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But once I left Pan Am,

415
00:45:16,936 --> 00:45:33,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I pursued the education in higher ed and then we went to Ethiopia where I taught at the Greek school there and I provided training for students who were looking for colleges in America.

416
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I did SAT training.

417
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I also worked in the, at the,

418
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:50,521
[SPEAKER_03]: United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, where I taught report writing skills, as well as how to communicate within the workforce.

419
00:45:51,021 --> 00:46:05,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was another opportunity to really develop my skill set and expertise in, what, diversity, diverse cultures, because the UN has employees from practically every country

420
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world and they speak just about every language.

421
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you make a team out of so much diversity?

422
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was what we did at Pan Am.

423
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:24,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Pan Am had women and men from every country that they flew to.

424
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And the purpose of that was so that the passengers who were going to Paris

425
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:41,629
[SPEAKER_03]: there would be a woman on the airplane from France who could tell these passengers what to see, what to do, who could speak the language, and vice versa.

426
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:54,357
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was somebody leaving France, coming to America, and there had limited English, there was somebody on the airplane from France who could adjust or help them in some way.

427
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

428
00:46:56,215 --> 00:47:04,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to try and bring, because we're getting close to our time, I want to ask a couple more questions, kind of bring this full circle.

429
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:09,018
[SPEAKER_01]: It's International Women's History Day today.

430
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

431
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:13,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you are an international trailblazer.

432
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you what that means to you.

433
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: What it means to me

434
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:26,572
[SPEAKER_03]: is the fact that women are awesome.

435
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:46,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to quote a famous comedian who said, he was, I'm paraphrasing now, and he said, I'm afraid of any animal

436
00:47:53,044 --> 00:48:05,550
[SPEAKER_03]: any animal that can carry another animal in their body, that can give birth, okay?

437
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:11,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one aspect of our awesomeness.

438
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But internationally, the comments are made that if you can train a woman, if you can educate a woman, if you can educate a mother,

439
00:48:21,823 --> 00:48:23,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You're educating a community.

440
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:24,265
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

441
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:25,166
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

442
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:26,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

443
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:27,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

444
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:29,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So no offense, brother, to you.

445
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:30,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you.

446
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:31,851
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

447
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:32,952
[SPEAKER_03]: No haters.

448
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:35,013
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are just bad.

449
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I get a hand for the women?

450
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:41,178
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

451
00:48:41,478 --> 00:48:46,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good segue into this other question I have.

452
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit about your Blackbirds group.

453
00:48:49,204 --> 00:48:50,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

454
00:48:51,245 --> 00:49:00,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like I said, when I got started in training class in 1970, there were very few of us.

455
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:09,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And the numbers increased a little bit because of the act, the Civil Rights Act of 1965.

456
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:18,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what I'm trying to do is to create a community

457
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:34,681
[SPEAKER_03]: of women of color who began flying with Pan American in the 60s and 70s up until the time that Pan American went bankrupt.

458
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:35,922
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was 91.

459
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:44,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were a lot of components that contributed to Pan American's demise.

460
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't go into that.

461
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,424
[SPEAKER_03]: You can Google.

462
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:57,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're trying to do is create this cohort of women, and I have named them Pan Am Blackbirds because we are women of color.

463
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:07,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're trying to do now, and Brother Terry was part of our first gathering at Harvard Medical School in September of 2018.

464
00:50:10,234 --> 00:50:18,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to tell the stories of these women because we were trailblazers.

465
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:24,882
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trailblazers because we were pretty, but we were smart.

466
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want the stories of how we were hired, but the beauty of the Blackbirds is what did we do after Pan American?

467
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:42,848
[SPEAKER_03]: We have educators, we have lawyers.

468
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:51,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of my Blackbirds, one was nominated by President Bill Clinton,

469
00:50:52,674 --> 00:51:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: and confirmed by the Senate to be the executive director of the African Development Bank in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa, with the title of ambassador.

470
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Another blackbird was

471
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: nominated and confirmed by the Senate under Joseph Biden to be the executive director of the African Development Bank at Côte d'Ivoire.

472
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got two of my Blackbirds who are ambassadors.

473
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:30,138
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my Blackbirds retired from an international pharmaceutical company.

474
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:34,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got nurses, physicians, I've got entrepreneurs.

475
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the world

476
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:47,758
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear how we were hired as young women, and we're all over 70, okay?

477
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:59,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are having a reunion in September of 2024, and I am in the process of trying to create a documentary, write a book,

478
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:18,021
[SPEAKER_03]: book about us, and I'm hoping to launch a podcast to tell the stories of these women, to let young people know that racism, discrimination existed 50 years ago.

479
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, it still exists.

480
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:26,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But we cannot allow it to create our narrative.

481
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:28,150
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, that's right.

482
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,303
[SPEAKER_03]: How did we do it?

483
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:34,806
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to let young people know how we did it.

484
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did we do it?

485
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:40,650
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it because we knew who we were.

486
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are we?

487
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just pretty.

488
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:47,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We were created by an awesome God.

489
00:52:48,156 --> 00:52:50,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody isn't ready for our color,

490
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their problem, not ours.

491
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a divine purpose.

492
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:56,962
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.

493
00:52:57,642 --> 00:53:01,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, my black birds, got in sync with that purpose.

494
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:07,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went on to be who we were meant to be post-Pan Am.

495
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:07,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

496
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:08,607
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

497
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,167
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

498
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you the last word.

499
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:15,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any parting thoughts?

500
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm retired, so I do a lot of thinking.

501
00:53:25,094 --> 00:53:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But my parting thought is one of the reasons that I want to tell our stories, one of the reasons I'm grateful to be here with each of you tonight

502
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:47,916
[SPEAKER_03]: is because I embrace an African proverb.

503
00:53:48,896 --> 00:54:00,979
[SPEAKER_03]: To paraphrase it, it says, until the lion can tell his story, the hunter will always tell them first.

504
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:08,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The hunter is glorified.

505
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:09,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You see?

506
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:12,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I want our stories.

507
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:14,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories are important.

508
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Our personal narrative is important.

509
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:28,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Because each of us has something valuable to add to the tapestry of this life.

510
00:54:29,455 --> 00:54:30,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of us is valued.

511
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of you is valued.

512
00:54:34,853 --> 00:54:35,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

513
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:36,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

514
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So in closing, I want everybody to think.

515
00:54:41,266 --> 00:54:52,891
[SPEAKER_03]: of a word because in my programming I always had my students do something called high five because my students were traditionally students from underserved communities.

516
00:54:53,771 --> 00:55:01,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had them practice reinforcing the positiveness about themselves.

517
00:55:02,534 --> 00:55:04,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So they always had to do a high five.

518
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:06,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's that?

519
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:08,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Five different

520
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,062
[SPEAKER_03]: adjectives about yourself.

521
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:17,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And they must begin with I am.

522
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:21,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Not I'm.

523
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:21,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

524
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Bold.

525
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I am confident.

526
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:26,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I am capable.

527
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:31,517
[SPEAKER_03]: These are qualities that are going to help you to be successful in life.

528
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: One student said, oh, that's cheesy, Dr. Sheila.

529
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:39,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the program, he said, ooh, that makes sense.

530
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:41,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does.

531
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's in closing, Mr. Terry.

532
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, because this conversation could go on literally for hours and hours and hours, because

533
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:56,147
[SPEAKER_01]: This woman has, I think I have stories, I really do.

534
00:55:56,547 --> 00:56:06,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But this woman has stories on top of stories on top of stories and we could literally do this for an hour more and still only scratch the surface.

535
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:10,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just, I wanna thank you because you have blessed my folk.

536
00:56:12,473 --> 00:56:16,654
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so engaging, your story is so amazing and

537
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:26,890
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to the podcast, the documentary, the book, and whatever else you want to do to tell the story of those wonderful Blackbirds.

538
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So give it up for Sheila E. Nutt.

539
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to say that I'm working with a young communications graduate at LaSalle University in Newton, and she's trying to get me to do some TikTok.

540
00:56:52,037 --> 00:57:00,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm thinking that I may have a TikTok handle called notes from the nuthouse.

541
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So look out for that one as well.

542
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:08,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you be careful with that TikTok cause they a whole lot of mess on TikTok.

543
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:10,119
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

544
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, folks, so we're going to take a few minutes.

545
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:19,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to reset this area so that we can get ready for our musical performance for the evening.

546
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:21,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back with some announcements.

547
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:24,062
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some refreshments in the back.

548
00:57:24,763 --> 00:57:32,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Janelle Coleman has made some delicious little niblets, so you can go back there, and before they're all gone, you can go grab yourself something.

549
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:33,585
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some water.

550
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:35,085
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some other snacks back there.

551
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:38,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be back in just a few minutes with part two

552
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:42,046
[SPEAKER_01]: of First Fridays, Flex Fridays, words, and music.

553
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:12,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, folks, if you can take your seats, we're going to get started.

554
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:28,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

555
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:45,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I see everybody back there biting on Janelle's food?

556
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:46,579
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

557
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,240
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it works.

558
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:01,547
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

559
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're ready to get started again.

560
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:08,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't ordinarily do this.

561
01:03:09,413 --> 01:03:13,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do one piece of poetry at the beginning and then we go.

562
01:03:14,694 --> 01:03:23,517
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in this particular instance, I'm going to do one more piece because, well, you'll understand.

563
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:27,718
[SPEAKER_01]: This piece is called Brown Girl at the Cello.

564
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:37,517
[SPEAKER_01]: For a moment, I blinked at what I was seeing, this chocolate hint of a Renaissance being.

565
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:42,607
[SPEAKER_01]: My ears abruptly filled with sound that made my senses rise spellbound.

566
01:03:43,442 --> 01:03:45,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a wistful wail or a spectral moan?

567
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it borrowed or was it her own?

568
01:03:48,863 --> 01:03:59,526
[SPEAKER_01]: As she brought her bow across the strings, it made me reflect on a thousand things of how our people persevered, a race at once reviled and revered.

569
01:04:00,426 --> 01:04:09,908
[SPEAKER_01]: As her fingers danced, so flowing in light, it made me recall the joy of our flight across the land to freedom's beacon, to the flame of liberty we'd been seeking.

570
01:04:11,465 --> 01:04:17,592
[SPEAKER_01]: The voicings of that hourglass frame remove the fear, the hurt, and shame.

571
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:19,815
[SPEAKER_01]: It led us away from racial scorn.

572
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It led us away from hate forsworn.

573
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It led us away from love forlorn.

574
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:28,325
[SPEAKER_01]: It led us to places where grace is born.

575
01:04:30,697 --> 01:04:32,899
[SPEAKER_01]: The soul at peace is how it settles.

576
01:04:33,379 --> 01:04:35,841
[SPEAKER_01]: No thorns, no briars, no stinging nettles.

577
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:40,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a siren song in the dead of night or a distant horizon beckoning bright?

578
01:04:41,384 --> 01:04:47,729
[SPEAKER_01]: As she brought her bow across those strings, the spirit moves and her cello sings.

579
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:55,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a little girl watch in wonder and knew in my heart the spell she was under.

580
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:58,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I would weep at her earnest glance.

581
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:01,347
[SPEAKER_01]: The instrument's melody made her dance.

582
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:06,251
[SPEAKER_01]: New confidence born in this tiny frame whose life will never be the same.

583
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:12,156
[SPEAKER_01]: She saw a brown girl like herself take a symphony down from the shelf.

584
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:18,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Where limitation is so often placed, she witnessed the captor's lie erased.

585
01:05:18,901 --> 01:05:25,445
[SPEAKER_01]: She saw that cellist pluck those strings and imagined herself as a thousand things.

586
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:31,870
[SPEAKER_01]: The confidence born in this tiny frame whose life will never be the same.

587
01:05:35,492 --> 01:05:35,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

588
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:48,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight we feature a well-established and highly professional performer that has gained a huge following and has also made some important history in Massachusetts and New England.

589
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me great pleasure to introduce a symphonic sensation by the name of Mashunda Smith.

590
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:11,106
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a composer, a conductor, and a highly skilled teacher with an amazing repertoire and a broad musical vocabulary as you will soon see and hear.

591
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:19,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally hailing from Tennessee, Mashunda's enchantment with music began in the sixth grade when she picked up the cello

592
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially sparked by a teenage crush, her passion quickly evolved into a genuine love for the instrument.

593
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:35,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Earning her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville marked the inception of her musical odyssey.

594
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:55,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Embarking first on a teaching career, she later obtained a master's degree in orchestral conducting with a focus on music education at the University of Southern Maine, receiving mentorship from distinguished conductors like James Fellenbaum, Victor Yampolsky, Robert Lehman, Adrian Ganam, and others.

595
01:06:56,013 --> 01:07:07,761
[SPEAKER_01]: With serious musical credits in tow, her symphonic journey ultimately led her to the Boston area, where she established herself on the North Shore while maintaining connections in Maine and New Hampshire.

596
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:13,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Mashunda co-founded the groundbreaking No Name Orchestra of Boston in 2018.

597
01:07:15,146 --> 01:07:27,371
[SPEAKER_01]: This innovative ensemble challenges norms by bringing soloists and orchestra members together for performances without rehearsals, fostering spontaneous and captivating musical experiences.

598
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:36,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in its eighth year, the No Name Orchestra continues to captivate audiences across the Boston metro area with its unique approach.

599
01:07:39,648 --> 01:07:41,729
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important work that she's doing.

600
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:46,012
[SPEAKER_01]: She is now the conductor of the Lowell Philharmonic.

601
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:55,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And she is the first woman of color ever to be so named by that splendid orchestra.

602
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:57,660
[SPEAKER_01]: She is teaching.

603
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,702
[SPEAKER_01]: She has her own private music studio.

604
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:07,106
[SPEAKER_01]: She is also teaching in the public school system, doing a number of different things.

605
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:18,215
[SPEAKER_01]: to educate children in music and also to give them the confidence to be able to play as she plays and she plays.

606
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:24,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get out the way and the next thing you hear will be the lustrous Mashunda Smith.

607
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:31,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

608
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:34,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

609
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start with one piece.

610
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:43,711
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called Folk Suite for Solo Cello.

611
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:47,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by another cellist named Daniel Delaney.

612
01:08:49,016 --> 01:08:55,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like this because since I'm from Tennessee, there's a lot of folk music, bluegrass and everything.

613
01:08:55,081 --> 01:08:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, I found this some years ago and it kind of struck me.

614
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna start with that.

615
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:03,429
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the prelude to his suite.

616
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:10,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good evening.

617
01:12:10,295 --> 01:12:13,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a wonderful introduction.

618
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Marshaunda Smith.

619
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do these.

620
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:22,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell you a story of how I got here.

621
01:12:24,938 --> 01:12:28,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I meet someone, I'm like, oh, you're so fascinating.

622
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get here?

623
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:31,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is your story?

624
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:36,200
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times have somebody actually said, how did you get here?

625
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And genuinely,

626
01:12:38,877 --> 01:12:39,477
[SPEAKER_02]: want to know.

627
01:12:41,478 --> 01:12:53,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it so fascinating to just listen to somebody's stories and hopefully you learn something about yourself.

628
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:59,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn something about the world that you didn't know before.

629
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:04,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Some lessons learned and just

630
01:13:06,517 --> 01:13:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, just be in their presence.

631
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:19,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them tell their story, because odds are no one's asked them, like, how did you get here at this moment in time?

632
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We're intersecting right here at this moment, at this time, and this day.

633
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:24,681
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get here?

634
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:25,762
[SPEAKER_02]: What brought you here?

635
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:27,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna start from the beginning.

636
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born.

637
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

638
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:39,273
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll probably hear my accent come in and out.

639
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:42,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been told when I get upset, it really comes out.

640
01:13:44,435 --> 01:13:51,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that it comes out when I'm articulating for my students, especially if I'm giving them the eye.

641
01:13:52,539 --> 01:13:55,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking very clearly, darling.

642
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:07,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a school called Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, and it was wonderful.

643
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:09,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 53% white, 46% black, and it was great.

644
01:14:22,432 --> 01:14:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wonderful.

645
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: All friends were all friends with everybody.

646
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:36,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got different perspectives from people who lived on Signal Mountain, people who lived on Lookout Mountain, people who lived in the projects, people who just lived in suburbs.

647
01:14:37,495 --> 01:14:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually, I found it fascinating just to hear their stories, how they get to school, what they do after school.

648
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but sometimes there's a little jealousy going on.

649
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

650
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:56,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Some kids are doing some things that you think are cool and you can't do it or you don't do it.

651
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:00,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But my school was the first.

652
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:14,255
[SPEAKER_02]: time that I really saw different people and actually enjoyed their lives, enjoyed their stories, the difference of it.

653
01:15:14,295 --> 01:15:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't jealous by it, but it was fascinating.

654
01:15:17,616 --> 01:15:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, we can coexist in this same world and have totally different walks of life.

655
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that very fascinating.

656
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:30,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna play another thing.

657
01:15:33,258 --> 01:15:40,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is from the same folk suite, Daniel Delaney.

658
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is his lullaby.

659
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:43,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon.

660
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:38,411
you

661
01:19:04,048 --> 01:19:07,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So I graduated from Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences.

662
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a class of 97, so we knew everybody.

663
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:16,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

664
01:19:16,114 --> 01:19:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Vols.

665
01:19:19,095 --> 01:19:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went there.

666
01:19:20,576 --> 01:19:24,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, first I took one year at the University of Chattanooga.

667
01:19:25,518 --> 01:19:32,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to the University of Knoxville, and I went there on a full scholarship, which was quite nice.

668
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:39,125
[SPEAKER_02]: in music, but that wasn't the original plan.

669
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:51,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually liked math and science, but no university was really giving out a scholarship for math and science.

670
01:19:52,466 --> 01:19:56,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one easily for music, easily for music.

671
01:19:56,911 --> 01:20:00,556
[SPEAKER_02]: While I was in high school, I kept getting these high marks in music.

672
01:20:00,656 --> 01:20:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to Allstate and AllEast, and it was fun.

673
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun doing all this stuff.

674
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:11,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And during these Allstate things, they checked you on

675
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they play a scale?

676
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they play the prepared piece?

677
01:20:15,021 --> 01:20:16,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they sight read?

678
01:20:16,923 --> 01:20:22,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who don't know, sight reading is they put a piece of music in front of you and you play it.

679
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:26,670
[SPEAKER_02]: How perfect can you be at just you're seeing it for the first time?

680
01:20:27,611 --> 01:20:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was good.

681
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really good.

682
01:20:32,154 --> 01:20:33,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It was due to my math.

683
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:44,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It was due to my math, because I knew how to divide and do all the things that music was asking me to do.

684
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:50,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I loved math, but I got a full scholarship, so that kind of made my decision.

685
01:20:55,547 --> 01:21:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things back in high school that I think I knew that I was going to go into music, my best friend Lauren and I, we were doing some musical thing in the state for kids.

686
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:12,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

687
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They start to blur together.

688
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were in middle Tennessee at,

689
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:23,369
[SPEAKER_02]: a really cute college that looks like Europe, old Europe in a way.

690
01:21:24,471 --> 01:21:30,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were leaving, and I have to put my jello down for this, because this is like interactive.

691
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:44,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had just finished Allstate Orchestra, like a few weeks prior, and we played Dvorak Symphony No.

692
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:46,479
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 or 7, one of those.

693
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had prepared it and we had played it and we were just like, yes!

694
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's a violinist, a black violinist.

695
01:21:53,624 --> 01:21:55,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're just like, this is wonderful.

696
01:21:55,344 --> 01:22:01,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And her dad, Mr. Goss, her dad is driving us from these college visits.

697
01:22:01,726 --> 01:22:04,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was raining, and we were in his van.

698
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dvorak came on the radio.

699
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:11,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And she started singing her violin part, and I'm singing the cello part.

700
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:14,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to this tumultuous part in it.

701
01:22:14,669 --> 01:22:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

702
01:22:17,289 --> 01:22:19,610
[SPEAKER_02]: She's singing it, and I know Mr. Goss was just like,

703
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:23,311
[SPEAKER_02]: well, what are you gonna do?

704
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: These two girls are just rocking out to this classical music.

705
01:22:27,513 --> 01:22:34,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's raining, he's trying to focus on her, the two screaming girls are ready to scream at this classical music.

706
01:22:34,938 --> 01:22:44,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, it got to this, the climax of this movement, and at the same time it got to the climax,

707
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:53,164
[SPEAKER_02]: It stopped raining, and the sun just shone right there in front of us as we were driving on the road.

708
01:22:54,184 --> 01:22:57,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And we stopped, and we're like, did that just happen?

709
01:22:57,905 --> 01:22:59,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Goss was like, yeah, that did just happen.

710
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:01,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It did just happen.

711
01:23:01,527 --> 01:23:01,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?

712
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,440
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the odds?

713
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the odds that that happened?

714
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:10,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the moments that I thought, I like this feeling.

715
01:23:11,707 --> 01:23:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I brought that on or Lauren brought that on, but this feeling of having fun in the music and feeling good about it, and then having someone next to you just nerding out.

716
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:26,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just nerding out.

717
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:27,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so much fun.

718
01:23:28,806 --> 01:23:39,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple of months later, we went to Hunter Museum in Chattanooga, was hosting the Chattanooga String Quartet from the Chattanooga Symphony.

719
01:23:41,197 --> 01:23:44,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were playing Schubert's The Trout.

720
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time,

721
01:23:49,033 --> 01:23:54,259
[SPEAKER_02]: The viola, which is, the violas get so much bad rap in the orchestra.

722
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,765
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like the middle stepchild, and they get so much bad rap.

723
01:23:59,245 --> 01:24:07,115
[SPEAKER_02]: But so we sat right there in front, and of course, you know, two little black girls like sitting right there in front, and everybody's like, oh.

724
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:30,407
[SPEAKER_02]: okay we're like hi we sat there right there in front we were ready we've been hearing all about the Schubert trial just like okay what is this we get in free let's go Lauren we went set right there in the front and the viola line we were so impressed by the viola we're like violas have things

725
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:33,924
[SPEAKER_02]: They can play things too?

726
01:24:34,645 --> 01:24:36,246
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so impressed.

727
01:24:36,826 --> 01:24:47,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And so any student right now, or even in my orchestras, they know that I call the viola section the cream of an orchestra, of the string section.

728
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:51,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Because without the cream in an Oreo, there's just two cookies.

729
01:24:51,395 --> 01:24:53,637
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the cello and you have the violin.

730
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:54,577
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just two cookies.

731
01:24:54,838 --> 01:24:58,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cream, that bridge is the middle part.

732
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:00,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the viola sound.

733
01:25:00,993 --> 01:25:10,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just that violist playing the quartet, the trout, and just hearing them just go at it, and we're like, whoa, it changed my mind.

734
01:25:12,143 --> 01:25:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have so many memories and moments where somebody has done something poignant, somebody has said something poignant, where I'm like, wow.

735
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that change of perspective.

736
01:25:26,462 --> 01:25:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that knowledge.

737
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:33,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for opening up a door that I didn't even know was closed.

738
01:25:35,066 --> 01:25:35,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

739
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:46,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I love learning about anything, especially things that make people happy.

740
01:25:49,193 --> 01:25:50,274
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes me happy?

741
01:25:51,174 --> 01:25:51,735
[SPEAKER_02]: My bliss.

742
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:59,084
[SPEAKER_02]: As Terry said, I am a conductor of the Loyal Field Harmonic.

743
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:05,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually created my own orchestra before I became conductor.

744
01:26:05,649 --> 01:26:11,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going out on all these auditions to, you know, they're looking for a new conductor, looking for a new conductor.

745
01:26:11,673 --> 01:26:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always came up number two, runner up.

746
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:21,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, you want something different, but that's not what you're getting.

747
01:26:24,602 --> 01:26:26,703
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting the same thing, but 2.0.

748
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:28,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, you know what?

749
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:31,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a network of musicians.

750
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just create my own table and orchestra.

751
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So I created the Cherry Hill Chamber Orchestra, and I run it the way I want to run it.

752
01:26:41,148 --> 01:26:45,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I run it in a wholesome way, as in, leave your egos at the door.

753
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:48,210
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no divas.

754
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna play this for us, and then translate it to the audience.

755
01:26:54,764 --> 01:26:57,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's first and foremost have fun with this music.

756
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a conductor, but I'm not perfect.

757
01:27:01,648 --> 01:27:02,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make a mistake.

758
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:04,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will own it.

759
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I will own it.

760
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:08,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm still learning.

761
01:27:08,673 --> 01:27:09,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never cease to learn.

762
01:27:11,214 --> 01:27:18,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And my bliss is actually getting hit with all the music, with all the sounds, any of the sounds.

763
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:18,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

764
01:27:21,311 --> 01:27:25,893
[SPEAKER_02]: People who know me, they know that I dance on the podium.

765
01:27:29,295 --> 01:27:29,935
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband here.

766
01:27:31,056 --> 01:27:34,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I dance on the podium because the music moves me.

767
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:39,180
[SPEAKER_02]: If music moves you, move.

768
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:45,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I invite anyone at my concerts to not only

769
01:27:46,997 --> 01:27:53,884
[SPEAKER_02]: clap in between movements, because you're just like, I need to emote what I just heard.

770
01:27:53,944 --> 01:28:03,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone to symphony orchestra concerts before, and the orchestra has played a poignant piece, and I'm just like, I need to talk to somebody about this right now.

771
01:28:04,595 --> 01:28:08,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is awesome, but everybody's like,

772
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

773
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:27,061
[SPEAKER_02]: My concerts, I actually invite the audience to clap, to sigh, to close your eyes, to emote.

774
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:31,204
[SPEAKER_02]: In between movements, to ask me a question.

775
01:28:33,086 --> 01:28:35,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I go out to the audience and I ask a question.

776
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:37,289
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you hear?

777
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that make you feel?

778
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I turn to the orchestra.

779
01:28:43,933 --> 01:28:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, can you play that thing that you did?

780
01:28:47,036 --> 01:28:48,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Now play it this way.

781
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And just have an interactive experience.

782
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:52,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more entertaining that way.

783
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:57,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of just, you pay your ticket, sit, listen, leave.

784
01:28:57,884 --> 01:28:59,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, that's boring to me.

785
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to do things a little different.

786
01:29:06,556 --> 01:29:14,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, all the great things, but I also like working with living composers because I can talk to them.

787
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:16,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I can talk to them.

788
01:29:17,522 --> 01:29:24,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my favorite living composers, he lives in Danvers, his name is Charles Turner.

789
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:29,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Charles Turner, yes.

790
01:29:30,354 --> 01:29:44,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And during COVID, when we were all in our house, twiddling our thumbs, there was this thing going on online, started here in Boston, actually, by a Boston symphony player.

791
01:29:44,801 --> 01:29:46,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called these musical minutes.

792
01:29:48,162 --> 01:29:54,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So instrumentalists reached out to composers and said, can you compose a one minute piece?

793
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:59,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would record it, put it online, and it was fascinating.

794
01:29:59,755 --> 01:30:02,557
[SPEAKER_02]: People were working, people were video, it was great.

795
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:10,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked Charles Turner, because I love his music, I asked him, hey, can you, this is what's happening, can you create something for me?

796
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:11,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did.

797
01:30:11,722 --> 01:30:14,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna play a couple of things.

798
01:30:14,983 --> 01:30:17,025
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was the first thing that he created.

799
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:22,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called The Minute Tango, aka The Lady Walks Away.

800
01:31:07,404 --> 01:31:07,965
do do

801
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,541
do do

802
01:32:26,966 --> 01:32:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So in college, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Dr. Wesley Baldwin, he was wonderful.

803
01:32:35,652 --> 01:32:36,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved him.

804
01:32:37,874 --> 01:32:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: My first cello teacher, bless his heart, he, a developing body in high school, and he said, I don't know what to do with your body as it's developing.

805
01:32:52,784 --> 01:32:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like,

806
01:32:57,075 --> 01:32:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with that?

807
01:32:59,915 --> 01:33:03,117
[SPEAKER_02]: He was good, but I was like, why are you telling me this?

808
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:10,643
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I got to Dr. Baldwin, and his hands are huge.

809
01:33:11,123 --> 01:33:13,445
[SPEAKER_02]: His hand span is really big.

810
01:33:13,966 --> 01:33:16,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, he said, Marshanda, you have to do it this way.

811
01:33:16,608 --> 01:33:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: He speaks like this.

812
01:33:18,209 --> 01:33:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Marshanda, it's this way.

813
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:22,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Dr. Baldwin, your hand is huge.

814
01:33:22,692 --> 01:33:24,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot stretch this way.

815
01:33:24,594 --> 01:33:26,975
[SPEAKER_02]: My body cannot do this.

816
01:33:31,777 --> 01:33:33,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're right.

817
01:33:33,562 --> 01:33:34,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

818
01:33:35,929 --> 01:33:36,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try something else.

819
01:33:40,888 --> 01:33:42,589
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I wanna hear from a teacher.

820
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:53,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear, or no student should hear, your body is stopping you from doing what you would like to do.

821
01:33:53,177 --> 01:34:04,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a teacher who's gonna say, I see and hear you, let's figure something else out so you can get to where you want to go.

822
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:06,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him.

823
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:09,362
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.

824
01:34:10,463 --> 01:34:15,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was so inspirational that there was one time he was doing a recital.

825
01:34:15,825 --> 01:34:16,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so inspired.

826
01:34:16,906 --> 01:34:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to leave his recital, during his recital, to go practice.

827
01:34:21,128 --> 01:34:22,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so inspirational.

828
01:34:23,269 --> 01:34:24,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And teachers liked that.

829
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: When I told him, he was like, why did you leave, Marsha?

830
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I was so inspired.

831
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I had to practice.

832
01:34:29,892 --> 01:34:31,253
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, OK.

833
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:35,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll give you that.

834
01:34:36,655 --> 01:34:38,156
[SPEAKER_02]: He continues to be inspirational.

835
01:34:38,196 --> 01:34:53,842
[SPEAKER_02]: He just published a book of African, Latin, people of color collection of living composers and recently deceased composers.

836
01:34:53,862 --> 01:34:54,963
[SPEAKER_02]: He just published it.

837
01:34:56,603 --> 01:34:57,724
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not a person of color.

838
01:34:59,525 --> 01:35:19,018
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not a person of color, and yet he's like, there's so much out there that has been hidden, and it's wonderful, and I'm glad that he's an advocate to getting it out there.

839
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in college and going around town,

840
01:35:28,001 --> 01:35:30,402
[SPEAKER_02]: People would say, oh, you have such life.

841
01:35:30,962 --> 01:35:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

842
01:35:31,543 --> 01:35:32,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, I'm a musician.

843
01:35:32,703 --> 01:35:35,204
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, you sing gospel.

844
01:35:40,247 --> 01:35:40,427
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

845
01:35:42,608 --> 01:35:44,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jazz.

846
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Your ignorance is showing.

847
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:53,592
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I play the cello.

848
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:54,533
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

849
01:35:56,704 --> 01:35:57,945
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what a violin is?

850
01:35:58,585 --> 01:36:00,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, it's big.

851
01:36:06,549 --> 01:36:15,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I even had one time someone tell me that I was too articulate.

852
01:36:17,514 --> 01:36:20,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was too articulate.

853
01:36:23,457 --> 01:36:24,157
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

854
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too articulate.

855
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandma was a teacher.

856
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I love stories and I listen to how people speak.

857
01:36:40,942 --> 01:36:41,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't I clear?

858
01:36:43,003 --> 01:36:47,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't everybody be clear if they're trying to communicate?

859
01:36:47,847 --> 01:36:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean, I'm too articulate?

860
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:52,090
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their problem.

861
01:36:54,255 --> 01:36:57,236
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't trained their ears to hear the articulation.

862
01:36:57,696 --> 01:36:58,617
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on you, babe.

863
01:37:01,218 --> 01:37:18,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I left Knoxville and came to Maine because I started conducting in Knoxville, and I wanted to find a teacher that didn't have a big ego, because I didn't have time for that.

864
01:37:19,389 --> 01:37:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to learn.

865
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:28,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I sent out an email to a lot of professors and universities, and I asked them one question.

866
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:44,526
[SPEAKER_02]: When you are preparing a piece, do you prepare it according to the composer's wishes, dead composer's wishes, to the best of your ability, given that we have different instruments today, or do you do what you want?

867
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:49,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So many conductors said, oh, they're dead, I do what I want.

868
01:37:51,109 --> 01:38:01,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But my teacher up in Maine, Dr. Robert Lehman, he said, given today's period instruments, I will program things because I respect the composer and what he or she was trying to do.

869
01:38:01,273 --> 01:38:10,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to adhere to their wishes, adding my own little flair, and also taking into consideration today's modern instruments.

870
01:38:10,357 --> 01:38:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh yes, okay.

871
01:38:12,298 --> 01:38:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're bringing respect to the artist, the original artist.

872
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I really dug that.

873
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:21,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started working with him up in Maine.

874
01:38:21,705 --> 01:38:28,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Maine is, when I went to Maine the first time, it was dark at four o'clock.

875
01:38:30,387 --> 01:38:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Chattanooga and Knoxville, we're on the same time zone.

876
01:38:33,428 --> 01:38:36,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got here, I'm like, what is going on?

877
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:40,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was wet and muddy.

878
01:38:41,391 --> 01:38:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people in Maine was like, yeah, this is mud season.

879
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:54,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, we're so far east on the eastern time zone that we should be in the other time zone.

880
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:56,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, okay, that's weird.

881
01:38:57,327 --> 01:39:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But I started, studied with Dr. Lehman in Maine.

882
01:39:01,911 --> 01:39:02,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Got everything that I needed.

883
01:39:04,253 --> 01:39:05,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that I needed.

884
01:39:08,476 --> 01:39:16,603
[SPEAKER_02]: But while I was up there, I was the conductor of a local youth orchestra.

885
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved it so much.

886
01:39:23,378 --> 01:39:24,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But things change.

887
01:39:25,019 --> 01:39:25,919
[SPEAKER_02]: People evolve.

888
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:31,882
[SPEAKER_02]: People's egos get in the way and are threatened.

889
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:43,688
[SPEAKER_02]: When that happens, I noticed that I started, it was a pattern.

890
01:39:44,248 --> 01:39:45,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I was intimidating.

891
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:52,322
[SPEAKER_02]: just being, I was just intimidating, asking questions was intimidating.

892
01:39:53,082 --> 01:39:57,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, OK, all right, well, bye, Felicia.

893
01:40:00,046 --> 01:40:00,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You do you.

894
01:40:01,687 --> 01:40:04,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go over here and just continue to be.

895
01:40:07,551 --> 01:40:11,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I always try to learn from my experiences, whether they're good or bad.

896
01:40:11,473 --> 01:40:13,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great thing to do.

897
01:40:17,057 --> 01:40:18,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Another piece that I want to play for you.

898
01:40:27,407 --> 01:40:29,149
[SPEAKER_02]: This composer lives in Gloucester.

899
01:40:30,933 --> 01:40:38,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Fabonio, his wife, Mary Jane, is a cellist and she plays in my orchestra whenever I ask her.

900
01:40:39,835 --> 01:40:44,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's pretty popular in the UK, yeah.

901
01:40:45,777 --> 01:40:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: But he creates and writes these pieces that I love.

902
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:50,119
[SPEAKER_02]: like as well.

903
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is called The First of Winter.

904
01:40:52,803 --> 01:41:00,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually dedicated to a friend of ours, Judy, I just saw her today, and her husband.

905
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is The First of Winter.

906
01:44:03,228 --> 01:44:07,552
[SPEAKER_02]: My first winter here in New England, very different from Tennessee.

907
01:44:08,793 --> 01:44:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting in the North Shore Philharmonic Orchestra.

908
01:44:11,955 --> 01:44:14,938
[SPEAKER_02]: This was 2007.

909
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:22,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no clue that you all have no humidity during the winter.

910
01:44:23,145 --> 01:44:23,906
[SPEAKER_02]: No humidity.

911
01:44:24,506 --> 01:44:27,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't aware that

912
01:44:28,709 --> 01:44:30,470
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to do things to my cello.

913
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:31,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting in orchestra.

914
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:33,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

915
01:44:34,071 --> 01:44:37,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm listening to the conductor talk about other things, because I'm a good student.

916
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what he's saying over there across the orchestra may apply to me.

917
01:44:44,113 --> 01:44:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm listening and being like, OK, all right.

918
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

919
01:44:48,494 --> 01:44:50,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, OK, yeah, we have that later on.

920
01:44:51,155 --> 01:44:54,176
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and then just kind of look down at my cello.

921
01:44:54,881 --> 01:44:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And this neck right here was detached from the body.

922
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:06,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a person walking around with a broken neck.

923
01:45:07,075 --> 01:45:09,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm sitting there in orchestra, I'm going, oh!

924
01:45:12,205 --> 01:45:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hadn't snapped.

925
01:45:14,147 --> 01:45:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It just had kind of came apart because it was just dry, dry, dry.

926
01:45:18,692 --> 01:45:19,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The wood was just dry.

927
01:45:20,274 --> 01:45:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I didn't notice it because the strings were still intact.

928
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:24,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing on it.

929
01:45:24,799 --> 01:45:30,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a lot of pounds per square inch these strings are holding, but I stopped.

930
01:45:30,946 --> 01:45:31,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't,

931
01:45:32,387 --> 01:45:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I was traumatized.

932
01:45:33,787 --> 01:45:35,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen that before.

933
01:45:35,808 --> 01:45:39,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, you don't do a humidifier?

934
01:45:39,349 --> 01:45:40,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what is that?

935
01:45:40,289 --> 01:45:41,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from Tennessee.

936
01:45:41,569 --> 01:45:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the Smoky Mountains.

937
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:45,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's humidity everywhere.

938
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:48,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, Marshaunda, it's dry here.

939
01:45:48,991 --> 01:45:50,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what is that?

940
01:45:52,814 --> 01:45:57,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a quick, hard lesson to learn.

941
01:45:57,997 --> 01:46:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, I actually got this cello up here in the Boston area from Rooning and Sons in Boston.

942
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And they shipped it down to Tennessee.

943
01:46:06,761 --> 01:46:10,082
[SPEAKER_02]: That was before I knew I was going to come up here to Boston.

944
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:11,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just like, fix it.

945
01:46:12,643 --> 01:46:13,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they fixed my cello.

946
01:46:14,964 --> 01:46:19,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And then life went on and played and kept playing here and there.

947
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,743
[SPEAKER_02]: always trying to find my bliss.

948
01:46:27,804 --> 01:46:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was trying to find my bliss.

949
01:46:31,006 --> 01:46:33,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one time where I was actually homeless.

950
01:46:35,768 --> 01:46:36,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually homeless.

951
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived on people's couches.

952
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:39,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I

953
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:49,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Worked and drove to Maine for three days to Rockport, Maine.

954
01:46:49,404 --> 01:46:53,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove there on Sunday nights.

955
01:46:54,928 --> 01:47:02,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Stayed to Tuesday, came back down, stayed with some friends in Somerville for two days, some friends in Medford for two days.

956
01:47:04,894 --> 01:47:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: One person in somewhere, Arlington, I think.

957
01:47:08,997 --> 01:47:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And then rinse and repeat.

958
01:47:11,278 --> 01:47:18,019
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal was to just keep working to pay off my car so I can continue to do music.

959
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:24,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having lessons on the side whenever I can, really just hustling.

960
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:26,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers don't make anything.

961
01:47:28,262 --> 01:47:29,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers don't make anything.

962
01:47:31,922 --> 01:47:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was one time where I was tired.

963
01:47:36,603 --> 01:47:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gotten my degree and I'm like,

964
01:47:40,057 --> 01:47:43,658
[SPEAKER_02]: At this moment, I was house cleaning in the Boston area.

965
01:47:43,678 --> 01:47:46,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I made bank, house cleaning.

966
01:47:46,599 --> 01:47:48,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very lucrative.

967
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:57,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not what I wanted to do, even though I could have kept going and actually bought a house.

968
01:47:57,442 --> 01:48:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is not what I want to do.

969
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:04,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to wake up every morning and be like, I'm going to.

970
01:48:05,184 --> 01:48:06,464
[SPEAKER_02]: feed my soul somehow.

971
01:48:07,605 --> 01:48:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to go back down to Tennessee because the cost of living is much lower, much lower.

972
01:48:16,187 --> 01:48:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

973
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:30,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at that time, I was also on the board of the North Shore Philharmonic and one of the board members, I told the board members, I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna go back to Tennessee and I'm just, I'm tired.

974
01:48:31,211 --> 01:48:32,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna do this.

975
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the board members said, well, Marshanda, I have a house.

976
01:48:38,154 --> 01:48:40,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, good for you.

977
01:48:40,296 --> 01:48:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, well, it's my mom's house.

978
01:48:45,398 --> 01:48:45,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for her.

979
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's empty, Marshanda.

980
01:48:51,542 --> 01:48:51,902
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

981
01:48:53,343 --> 01:48:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

982
01:48:55,436 --> 01:49:12,420
[SPEAKER_02]: um where's your where's your mom oh she's in the nursing home she has low-grade dementia she's about probably about five six years to live i'm like okay he's like well we kind of need someone in the house for insurance purposes it's it's i'm like where is the house he said hamilton winom and i'm like

983
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, he was like, oh yeah, it's a four bedroom, two car garage, large backyard, front yard, it's this and this and this and this, and I'm like, ah, I can't afford that.

984
01:49:31,457 --> 01:49:36,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying $800 for a room with strangers, I can't do that.

985
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:44,503
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, no, you don't have to pay, just pay for your utilities, just be in the house.

986
01:49:46,814 --> 01:49:47,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

987
01:49:49,108 --> 01:49:49,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

988
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So blessings come in all different ways.

989
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:58,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I stayed there for about four or five years.

990
01:49:58,831 --> 01:50:00,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid off two student loans.

991
01:50:00,832 --> 01:50:04,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not going to let that.

992
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:06,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I took advantage of that.

993
01:50:06,894 --> 01:50:08,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I took care of bills.

994
01:50:09,015 --> 01:50:11,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I put my car back in working order.

995
01:50:12,116 --> 01:50:15,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some more networking, got some more education.

996
01:50:15,517 --> 01:50:17,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully took advantage of that.

997
01:50:18,458 --> 01:50:21,539
[SPEAKER_02]: because not too many people have that gift.

998
01:50:23,499 --> 01:50:27,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, at that time, thank you, I started No Name Orchestra.

999
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the mental capacity and mental space to start things and actually start my path of finding my bliss.

1000
01:50:36,862 --> 01:50:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started Waldorf at the same time that I moved into that house in Waldorf School.

1001
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:59,246
[SPEAKER_02]: was very close to my school, Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, where they just said, Marshaunda, we just want you to be.

1002
01:51:02,467 --> 01:51:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to be?

1003
01:51:03,628 --> 01:51:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, the kids need to see different people just be.

1004
01:51:12,322 --> 01:51:28,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and for the first time in my life, I felt, wow, this is an organization that was not created for someone who looked like me, but they're saying, just exist.

1005
01:51:29,787 --> 01:51:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt so great to be amongst people that are just like, come as you are, like wholly come as you are.

1006
01:51:41,969 --> 01:51:43,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's collaborate.

1007
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring your skills.

1008
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:46,390
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you teach my kids?

1009
01:51:46,530 --> 01:51:47,631
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I learn from you?

1010
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:48,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, really?

1011
01:51:49,351 --> 01:51:50,091
[SPEAKER_02]: We could collaborate?

1012
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:50,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I can learn from you?

1013
01:51:50,911 --> 01:51:51,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn from me?

1014
01:51:52,011 --> 01:51:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's like no ego in it.

1015
01:51:54,392 --> 01:51:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I ask you a question, I'm not challenging you.

1016
01:51:57,313 --> 01:51:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly want to know.

1017
01:52:00,691 --> 01:52:01,180
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah.

1018
01:52:02,751 --> 01:52:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it, I loved it.

1019
01:52:04,432 --> 01:52:08,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on and got actually a certificate in Waldorf Music Education.

1020
01:52:09,115 --> 01:52:12,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now teaching Waldorf teachers in a couple of weeks.

1021
01:52:12,397 --> 01:52:20,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going down to Virginia to actually, to look at some other teachers and evaluate them.

1022
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:29,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in the Waldorf movement because they are the first organization that just allowed me to be as a black girl.

1023
01:52:31,307 --> 01:52:35,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved it, and that allowed me to flourish and find my bliss.

1024
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:43,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I did no name, went on so many auditions, meeting people, and life is fun.

1025
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:50,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is fun when you meet these people, when you actually sit down and have these conversations.

1026
01:52:50,197 --> 01:52:51,037
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get here?

1027
01:52:51,237 --> 01:52:52,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

1028
01:52:52,258 --> 01:52:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you choose that?

1029
01:52:53,979 --> 01:52:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And not be offended.

1030
01:52:57,446 --> 01:53:09,432
[SPEAKER_02]: when somebody asks you that, because it could be somebody just like me who just actually is interested in people in the world and your walk of life, and they actually want to learn.

1031
01:53:10,432 --> 01:53:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: We always say, oh, you should learn from our mistakes.

1032
01:53:13,613 --> 01:53:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm taking that to heart.

1033
01:53:16,535 --> 01:53:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: What wisdom can you impart on me?

1034
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for your gift.

1035
01:53:22,918 --> 01:53:23,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

1036
01:53:27,185 --> 01:53:30,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun, I try to eliminate as much drama as possible.

1037
01:53:30,849 --> 01:53:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I don't have time for that.

1038
01:53:32,971 --> 01:53:33,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody got time for that.

1039
01:53:34,652 --> 01:53:51,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely do hold my boundaries because there's only one life to live and I'm loving all the beautiful things that come at me and all the beautiful people that I learn from, all the new doors in my life.

1040
01:53:52,469 --> 01:53:56,493
[SPEAKER_02]: in my head that are opened because I ask people questions.

1041
01:53:57,333 --> 01:54:06,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when it comes to pieces that I'm playing, I love to ask the composers, why did you do this?

1042
01:54:07,722 --> 01:54:11,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as, you know, why'd you do that?

1043
01:54:12,005 --> 01:54:14,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But just like, what's going through your mind?

1044
01:54:15,811 --> 01:54:26,136
[SPEAKER_02]: My professor, Dr. Baldwin, when I was back in undergraduate school, he was, I was studying the Brahms cello sonata in E minor, and he asked me, he was like, Marshana, do you know what this is about?

1045
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:30,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I'm just playing the notes, because you told me to, you're my teacher, I'm just gonna do that, you know, I'm a good student.

1046
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:36,060
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, you should look up what's going on with this, and I did.

1047
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wrote this cello sonata after the passing of his mom.

1048
01:54:42,163 --> 01:54:42,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like,

1049
01:54:43,939 --> 01:54:46,441
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense now.

1050
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:53,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and after realizing that, I played it differently.

1051
01:54:54,549 --> 01:54:57,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I played it with a heavy heart.

1052
01:54:57,992 --> 01:55:00,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it as condolences.

1053
01:55:02,136 --> 01:55:02,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And it changed.

1054
01:55:05,162 --> 01:55:06,703
[SPEAKER_02]: how I look at music.

1055
01:55:07,363 --> 01:55:09,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than notes on a pape.

1056
01:55:10,704 --> 01:55:13,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Same way I treat people, like, why?

1057
01:55:13,885 --> 01:55:17,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how did you get to be who you are, what you are today?

1058
01:55:17,626 --> 01:55:20,527
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the inner meaning of the soul of this piece?

1059
01:55:21,488 --> 01:55:23,048
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the joy of this piece?

1060
01:55:23,508 --> 01:55:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if I come to a piece that doesn't have a history,

1061
01:55:30,467 --> 01:55:31,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a vivid imagination.

1062
01:55:32,048 --> 01:55:33,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what is it telling me?

1063
01:55:33,489 --> 01:55:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I imagining?

1064
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:38,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want to tell this story to the audience.

1065
01:55:38,552 --> 01:55:45,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the audience sees that this is a sad part or a happy part, I need to relay that as a performer.

1066
01:55:45,117 --> 01:55:46,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring them into the music.

1067
01:55:47,779 --> 01:55:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm talking to people, I want to come into you so I can figure out what makes you move?

1068
01:55:56,705 --> 01:55:58,946
[SPEAKER_02]: As a human being, we all move differently.

1069
01:55:59,086 --> 01:55:59,827
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes you move?

1070
01:56:01,807 --> 01:56:05,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking at the time and it is nine o'clock so we're right at the time.

1071
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:21,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's more talking than playing but I'm gonna play one more thing and I invite everybody to sit down and have coffee with your neighbor.

1072
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: When's the last time you actually sat down with your neighbor and just had coffee?

1073
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: just talk to them.

1074
01:56:33,652 --> 01:56:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you doing in 1980?

1075
01:56:37,194 --> 01:56:38,375
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that year like for you?

1076
01:56:38,395 --> 01:56:41,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And just have a conversation and just listen.

1077
01:56:42,438 --> 01:56:44,839
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating, people's journeys.

1078
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,321
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I find it fascinating.

1079
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:56,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said at the beginning, I learned so much about myself and the world around me and pieces of the world that I may not touch, but I learn.

1080
01:57:05,983 --> 01:57:13,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do, see I already did the tango, ah.

1081
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:18,873
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another Charles Turner special.

1082
01:57:18,893 --> 01:57:20,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from his minute pieces.

1083
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,196
[SPEAKER_02]: This is A Minute of Crazy Love.

1084
01:57:31,758 --> 01:57:33,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Love makes me light as air.

1085
01:57:53,963 --> 01:57:58,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I jump up and down, but I don't come down.

1086
01:58:25,224 --> 01:58:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Climbing hills is easy.

1087
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:54,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Love makes me sing opera.

1088
01:59:30,832 --> 01:59:34,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Love is like swimming down a waterfall.

1089
01:59:39,778 --> 01:59:40,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Or up a waterfall.

1090
02:00:01,317 --> 02:00:05,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, brown girl at the cello, Marshaunda Smith.

1091
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:06,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Marshaunda.

1092
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,341
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just wonderful.

1093
02:00:08,361 --> 02:00:26,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we learned so much in such a brief period of time about your motivations, about what makes you tick when you're maybe standing with your baton in front of your orchestra or when you're sitting down as a player in an orchestra with your cello.

1094
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:28,851
[SPEAKER_01]: whose neck is no longer broken.

1095
02:00:29,051 --> 02:00:29,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1096
02:00:32,714 --> 02:00:37,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So just have a few things to share with you.

1097
02:00:40,686 --> 02:00:52,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen of the West Medford Senior Club, we'll be hosting an afternoon tea and fundraiser on March 16th from 2 to 4 p.m.

1098
02:00:53,033 --> 02:00:57,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Join them or us for tea and fun and entertainment.

1099
02:00:57,736 --> 02:01:02,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickets are only $20 and you will really, really enjoy yourself.

1100
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:07,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that they do every year and it's always a really, really good time.

1101
02:01:07,861 --> 02:01:10,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So avail yourself of the opportunity

1102
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:16,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that usually Florence has tickets, Rachel has tickets, maybe Shirley has tickets.

1103
02:01:16,565 --> 02:01:20,207
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tickets in the building, so if you're interested, you can definitely go.

1104
02:01:21,467 --> 02:01:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been hosting, through Medford Connects, a black health series, and we had our first event on February 21st, cardiovascular health.

1105
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:37,473
[SPEAKER_01]: The second event is on March 27th, and it's Alzheimer's in the black community.

1106
02:01:37,993 --> 02:01:47,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So that full spectrum, you know, from mild dementia all the way through full-blown Alzheimer's will be talked about and discussed.

1107
02:01:47,339 --> 02:01:49,180
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to get questions answered.

1108
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:53,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be a good opportunity for folks to come out.

1109
02:01:53,462 --> 02:01:56,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be here at the community center March 27th from 5 to 7 p.m.

1110
02:02:01,107 --> 02:02:16,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in the community center and what makes us tick and how we keep ticking, you can certainly go online to wmcc.us or you can call us at 781-483-3042 for more information or

1111
02:02:20,074 --> 02:02:22,637
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important, to become a member.

1112
02:02:22,657 --> 02:02:36,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And elders, if you're interested, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship, that cup of coffee and conversation that you were talking about.

1113
02:02:37,114 --> 02:02:39,837
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten extremely good at it, as a matter of fact.

1114
02:02:40,337 --> 02:02:42,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So we serve lunch at 12 noon.

1115
02:02:43,058 --> 02:02:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And please join us in April, toward the end of April, and we'll be posting more information about this for our upcoming community legislative forum.

1116
02:02:55,782 --> 02:02:59,223
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it every year, and nobody does it better.

1117
02:03:00,563 --> 02:03:04,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC.

1127
02:03:50,603 --> 02:03:54,524
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, have a good evening, be safe out there, and we'll see you again soon.

1128
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:00,740
