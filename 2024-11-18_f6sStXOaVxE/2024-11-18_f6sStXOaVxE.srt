[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

116
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:15,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

117
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

118
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:20,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

119
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

120
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:24,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all very much.

121
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your time this evening.

122
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:41,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions orders and resolutions to to dash 341 offered by cancer Caraviello be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the mayor work with the Chamber of Commerce and Waste Management to come with a better plan for rubbish pickups and Medford Square.

123
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:49,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President, um, you know, we talked about, uh, you know, the beautification beautification meeting.

124
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,182
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the businesses put their rubbish out.

125
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:58,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, during the, some of them put them out on Saturday and Sunday and they're there for the weekend.

126
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:02,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets especially worse on the long weekend holidays.

127
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:09,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you, at the last weekend when we had a Patriots day, if you drove around the square, there was trash blowing everywhere, all over the streets.

128
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:19,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I did call Dennis McDonald, he could take care of some, but, and again, this is something I brought up with prior administrations that we have to figure out a way

129
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:24,572
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this rubbish off the street during business hours.

130
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:37,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, waste management, it's a 24 hour company, no reason why they can't come by during the, send the truck by at midnight or during the night, like they do in other areas, other cities and towns, just to get the stuff off there.

131
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:45,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I know in the past, they've talked about putting in a central dumpster somewhere, but again,

132
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:54,065
[SPEAKER_01]: When you drive through the square and you see rubbish all over the sidewalks and all the streets, it's just not a good look for our city.

133
00:09:54,085 --> 00:10:00,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that's been a little thing that I've had with the prior administrations also.

134
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:07,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope that maybe the chamber and waste management can come up with a better option of getting the commercial rubbish out of there.

135
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the few cities that even does commercial rubbish anymore.

136
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:25,874
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's and that's a whole nother issue and I hope that'll be something that that's that'll probably probably be something to discuss going forward with the next contract to say, if the administration come up with a better plan with the chamber, I'd be appreciated.

137
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:28,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the discussion.

138
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:34,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, motion of Councilor Caraviello, second by Vice President.

139
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna call you Vice President Nitzel.

140
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, I do just wanna thank you for bringing this up.

141
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:45,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one meeting a few months ago after we left, it, you know, it was really a pickup because along- Windy night.

142
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:49,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Windy night, rainy, and there was just trash absolutely everywhere.

143
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:55,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyone driving through, I don't know how you would think to come back to Medford Square in a day or another night because it was an absolute disaster.

144
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

145
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all part of our curb appeal.

146
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:00,791
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't have.

147
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:01,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

148
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

149
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:05,652
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

150
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,033
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

151
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:07,893
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

152
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-342 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

153
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:16,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that Manfred City Council have the administration open the Crystal Campbell Fountain at the Senior Center.

154
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:16,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

155
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:17,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

156
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:28,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, I was there for the opening of that Crystal Campbell Fountain, and I know during COVID we had it closed, but you know, I was at the Senior Center a few weeks ago.

157
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:29,178
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all looking

158
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:30,302
[SPEAKER_01]: get that open.

159
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:44,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's broken, but for whatever reason, and I'm gonna be quite honest, I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't opened during last week, two weeks ago, in memory of Crystal Campbell.

160
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:50,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have been open, I mean, we spent a lot of money on that, and it's been closed for two years and it's still closed now.

161
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Seniors, a lot of people go around and sit there.

162
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:55,197
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be open.

163
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:56,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it's not open.

164
00:11:56,378 --> 00:12:07,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'd ask that we, that the mayor open it up and get it going so people can again, enjoy it, enjoy the park there.

165
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

166
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,283
[SPEAKER_06]: No further discussion.

167
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:15,785
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Vice President Bears.

168
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:16,505
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

169
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:17,885
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

170
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,806
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

171
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,166
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-343 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

172
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:34,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the Mayor's Office and the DPW follow up on the City Council's meeting with residents last year of the lower end of Brooke Street and the promises made to them in the interest of public safety.

173
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

174
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

175
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:53,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of us, with the exception of Councilor Collins, were there on that Saturday morning in the rain with the people, and then they were promised that the sidewalks would be fixed, or even somewhat repaired, and it's almost a year later, and nothing has happened there.

176
00:12:53,803 --> 00:13:03,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a bad street, and what's making it worse now, they're getting ticketed for parking on sidewalks that don't exist.

177
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,151
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where this is coming from.

178
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:16,053
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that whole stretch of Brook Street, the lower end, these have sidewalks and curbs, some of the things that they're just getting washed away.

179
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:20,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, we were all there, we made a promise to those people to take care of it.

180
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a year later and nothing's happened.

181
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanna know what's going on there and why it's not fixed.

182
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

183
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bears.

184
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

185
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:34,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to also add that same day we also reviewed some

186
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:35,623
[SPEAKER_07]: requests for improvements.

187
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,336
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Auburn, Codding, North and West Street intersection.

188
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:44,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that didn't end up going to the traffic commission, but now it's sitting there on the table in the traffic commission.

189
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm, you know, it's just, we did both of those things the same day.

190
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't seen the action on them.

191
00:13:49,662 --> 00:14:00,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just request, make a motion or an amendment that we, the city clerk forward the committee report from those meetings to the DPW commissioner as we now, it was a different commissioner at the time.

192
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:04,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just want to make sure that he has the information from that meeting in front of him.

193
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:06,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

194
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

195
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:16,915
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Vice President Bears.

196
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:17,855
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

197
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

198
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:19,276
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

199
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

200
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-344 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

201
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:32,659
[SPEAKER_06]: be it so resolved that the mayor's office provide the Medford City Council an update on the progress of the plan to address the issues at the intersection of South Street and Main Street.

202
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:33,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

203
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

204
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is another project that seems to have stalled.

205
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody knows where it is.

206
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:45,005
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting tired of looking at the barrels there.

207
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:50,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was a big announcement that this project is going to get done.

208
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:54,209
[SPEAKER_01]: South Street is all paved and almost done now.

209
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:55,972
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're still looking at the barrels.

210
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:59,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we with this project?

211
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:05,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the state was gonna get involved, but again, I haven't seen any action or anything down there at all.

212
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd ask that we get a report of administration, what's going on with that South Street and Main Street project there.

213
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

214
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bears.

215
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:15,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

216
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:20,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just add that I know thanks to the advocacy of this council,

217
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:28,870
[SPEAKER_07]: that there was a $500,000 earmark included for this project in the ARPA bill passed by the state legislature.

218
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:35,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the intent of that was to kind of unlock additional bond money as well in the transportation bond bill.

219
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:46,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanna put that out there and then hopefully as part of the update, just get an update on the financing piece of it, because it seems like money is now out there.

220
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:46,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

221
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that they can get going on it very quickly.

222
00:15:50,805 --> 00:16:02,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are all these are all election year promises made to people, and they're not being followed up on any further discussion on the motion of cancer Caraviello second by Vice President Bears.

223
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,619
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor, I suppose.

224
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Passes vacations for the mayor to

225
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

226
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

227
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

228
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

229
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:32,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Public participation.

230
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:37,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone who would like to speak either on Zoom or in person for public participation?

231
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:48,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, small Zoom crowd tonight.

232
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in person who would like to speak?

233
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:57,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, moving on.

234
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:09,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the end of the agenda, unless folks have any unfinished business they would like to, not sure if anything is due to be taken off.

235
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:11,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it.

236
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:38,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, I would just note that there are a number of reports that we've requested from the administration that did have due dates in April of 2022, five-year plan on gas leaks, 90-day report on connecting classroom learning to career applications, as well as presentations on finances and warrant articles.

237
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to note that for the record.

238
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would move to adjourn.

239
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have that, Mr. Clerk, for the record?

240
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,428
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion of our chosen bears to adjourn seconded by Councilor Knight.

241
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:53,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

242
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:55,370
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

243
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting is adjourned.
