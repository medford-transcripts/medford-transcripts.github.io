[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

56
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everyone, we're back.

57
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We're recording.

58
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we've just returned from executive session.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two items left on our agenda.

60
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:41,046
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is a motion to approve our paraprofessionals contract.

61
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:47,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just took this vote in executive session and we'll take it again here.

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there a motion to approve

63
00:03:49,996 --> 00:04:00,326
[SPEAKER_04]: ratification of the paraprofessionals contract to approve ratification by member rinfeld seconded by anybody.

64
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember if so can you call the roll.

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:12,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember so you're on mute in case you didn't know that.

66
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on mute and I don't have my camera on, I have no idea.

67
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's when I left the room, it must do that by default.

68
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we don't have anybody who wants to speak, I see.

69
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:29,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley.

70
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:41,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you call the roll, just in case anybody catches this recording later, I just wanted to thank the members of the paraprofessional union for a really collaborative conversation.

71
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,773
[SPEAKER_04]: This contract, there's actually two contracts, a one year deal and a three year deal.

72
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:53,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And it includes the extension of the school day, which we've been talking so much about.

73
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with this contract,

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,783
[SPEAKER_04]: The paraprofessionals will be ready and with us as we step off in the new year, which we're really excited about.

75
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:13,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We are trying to fix some of the problems of practice that we see with our paraprofessionals around when they're being asked to cover for different obligations during the school day that are outside of their job.

76
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:15,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that.

77
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:25,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I'm truly the most excited about is the creation of some flexible time from our paraprofessionals to help us do the things that don't

78
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:33,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Get done so consistently in the district today and, um, you know, I think we all heard from members of the community.

79
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:49,151
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of months back about the need for bus monitors, so this contract will allow us some flexibility to deploy professionals among other kinds of duties after school events after school.

80
00:05:50,051 --> 00:06:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, parent nights, those kinds of things, but also to be able to support our students on the bus while they're in transit when we have like hot spots or flashpoints in the year.

81
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:07,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all bus rides are created equal and we want to make sure that they're all like safe and welcoming spaces for students.

82
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:12,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really excited about all of that in addition to, you know,

83
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:24,014
[SPEAKER_04]: increases that reflect this committee's work to make sure that our staff all are paid a wage that is livable.

84
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:30,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made huge strides there over the last six years, and this contract continues to do that.

85
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you to the committee.

86
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the paraprofessionals union.

87
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:45,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited about this and I think the people who are the most excited about this or the payroll office, because they will be able to process this without having to do retroactive pay before the year starts.

88
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So, everyone's everyone wins.

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to everyone.

90
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And number.

91
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So, can you call it?

92
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly member.

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:55,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

94
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Member grant.

95
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:58,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

96
00:06:59,123 --> 00:06:59,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

97
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:01,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade?

98
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:02,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

99
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld?

100
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

101
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Members say yes and Mayor Lengelkern is absent.

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

103
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:15,526
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is approved and the contract is ratified.

104
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:21,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will let the paraprofessionals unit know and congratulations to everyone.

105
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,428
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more agenda item this evening.

106
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:34,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Galusi, I'm going to turn it over to you for agenda item number five, after school site coordinator positions.

107
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it away.

108
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:36,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

109
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try here to first just share my screen.

110
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:46,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you all received, I shared this with you.

111
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:47,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see my screen right now?

112
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

113
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:52,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

114
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on one second, please.

115
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:20,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we have been, as this body knows, we have been really looking at trying to increase our capacity here for our after-school programs.

116
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:27,431
[SPEAKER_01]: To date, we have removed 53 students from the wait list since last school year.

117
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:38,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also, just as a reminder for people that are maybe just joining this meeting now, we are engaging in a consultation with BASIC.

118
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:48,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to one of the very first school committee meetings, present what that might look like, and ask for a vote for that to engage in that consultancy.

119
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:56,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to be doing too much to our staffing ahead of being able to have that gathered data.

120
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:14,139
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we're bringing on a new track, which is an early pickup time at 4 p.m., that new track has allowed us to be continuing to clear space off of the wait list, because when families elect for a 4 p.m.

121
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,662
[SPEAKER_01]: pickup time, in some cases it has opened up a 6 p.m.

122
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:20,123
[SPEAKER_01]: slot that we can then fill.

123
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:21,844
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to keep

124
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:29,732
[SPEAKER_01]: forward momentum going without going too far ahead as we're engaging in a consultancy.

125
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:44,167
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here to ask for the possibility of adding, which would be, well, increasing two site coordinator positions from the part-time that they are now to full-time.

126
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:54,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So really what the request is is just what it would look like in the budget, which I will talk about, which is a revolving account.

127
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,675
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just double what we're doing now.

128
00:09:57,135 --> 00:10:02,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the positions would consist of, there's four site coordinators, one for each building.

129
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:12,572
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be for two site coordinators only that would partner with all four schools to just help out with some of the logistics.

130
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:22,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Their year would be, there's a breakdown here, so you could see it would be 220 days, which consists of the 180 days of school.

131
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:26,993
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to add some school vacation programming to this.

132
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:34,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Time for the before and the end of school summer programming, as well as professional development.

133
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,616
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be working eight-hour days.

134
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: $36.93 an hour.

135
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:49,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the roles that it would be, another happy piece is that our partnership with City Year.

136
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:08,034
[SPEAKER_01]: is expanding a bit and they also are getting into the afterschool game and we are getting five city year employees that are separate from our core members that will be working in our McGlynn and our Missituk schools.

137
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those additional, so

138
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:17,539
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting 15 core members between the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and the McGlynn Elementary.

139
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Those core members also work in the afterschool at the end of the day.

140
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:28,325
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to those core members, we are also getting five additional staff members for afterschool care.

141
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,629
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage at the Missituk and the McGlynn.

142
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:52,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of just help with a lot of these logistics in trying to increase capacity, working with our partner city here, and just assisting with some of the operational day-to-day pieces, it would be helpful to be able to elevate two of those positions right now to full-time.

143
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:59,169
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in keeping with the model that BASIC does use.

144
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:02,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day,

145
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just kind of highlight here.

146
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:13,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, site coordinators are currently budgeted to earn $41,277.90, and if these two positions are created, there'd be an additional cost to the budget of $47,504.

147
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I previously mentioned, the afterschool is a revolving account.

148
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The budget can handle this increase.

149
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:40,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are here to ask if that would be a possibility.

150
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.

151
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

152
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this change benefits eligibility for anyone?

153
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:55,543
[SPEAKER_03]: What does this do?

154
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:57,003
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

155
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:57,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

156
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I have more questions, but I will.

157
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Tapa.

158
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:05,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

159
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:12,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Are these positions, the two site coordinators that are being brought to this role, are they already inhabited roles?

160
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:18,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And are these folks getting promotions or are these positions that need to be reposted and reapplied?

161
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:20,668
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.

162
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,669
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not looking to create a new position.

163
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:30,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we have four site coordinators that work the duration of the school year, and they work part time.

164
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:40,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this would do would be creating two of those positions, ideally one at one of the title one buildings and one at one of the non title one buildings.

165
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:46,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would just mean that they are now working full time instead of part time.

166
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:46,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

167
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:52,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so are these jobs going to be posted and then those four folks are going to apply?

168
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:53,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

169
00:13:53,454 --> 00:14:03,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it going to be that they're posted, but then the job is posted to the public with preference to the four folks that are already employed?

170
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:09,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, it would be an internal posting where out of the four.

171
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

172
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:11,091
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

173
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:11,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

174
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the committee?

175
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a, oh, Member Reinfeld?

176
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a little bit of clarification.

177
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit on the side here on the city year.

178
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So previously, you said we're getting more city year people.

179
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those more people being paid for?

180
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:48,189
[SPEAKER_03]: As I recall, we were splitting the city year, we were paying for city year partly out of afterschool, but not entirely.

181
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, that's still the same.

182
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but these new folks that are coming in is exclusively on the afterschool or are we?

183
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:03,015
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so, no, correct, no, it is not exclusively on the afterschool, it's still the same split.

184
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so our city year line item did go up.

185
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:15,066
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we maintained the same price as we did last year.

186
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,107
[SPEAKER_03]: But for more people.

187
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they have more people that they are.

188
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:30,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe, don't quote me, but I believe that we had about 11 core members last year, and now we're going to have 15 core members.

189
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:31,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

190
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,397
[SPEAKER_01]: For the same price.

191
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,218
[SPEAKER_01]: For the same price.

192
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish everything worked that way.

193
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're still being paid a reason.

194
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: This was one of our concerns a year ago was that.

195
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:42,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

196
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

197
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:50,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Compensation was they're able to live or near Medford or Boston.

198
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:51,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

199
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:53,073
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not go up in price.

200
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:56,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same exact cost as it was last year.

201
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,177
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say that

202
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:11,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is a benefit to Medford Public Schools because we are getting it at a slightly discounted rate than what maybe other districts are typically charged for city year.

203
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:13,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

204
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,632
[SPEAKER_03]: And then are we confident we will be able to offer vacation week programming for this?

205
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:25,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I see those days in there and not that we don't have plenty of work that people can do for eight days, but

206
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:28,804
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a goal of ours.

207
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we probably would not start with the December break.

208
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:36,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one where we have a lot.

209
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of families that have.

210
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,383
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation times and things coming up.

211
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:46,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our goal would be to target the February and April break.

212
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,628
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I was reading the eight days.

213
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:49,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

214
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:58,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanna make sure that that's- And I'm very sorry, there's an excessive amount of emergency vehicles that are reporting to the high school right now.

215
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:04,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little distracted and I might- Do you know why?

216
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.

217
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping it's not the woods again.

218
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:10,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

219
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:14,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

220
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,330
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go check that.

221
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want us to do a motion?

222
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:31,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see I had a question but now I'm worried that the superintendent may have to attend to that so my question can be asked, it's just okay, it's okay I can multitask right now.

223
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:39,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's just a quick question just so I have it in my brain so for the two new positions be incorporated for the site coordinator responsibilities in the budget, the additional $47,500.

224
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:48,979
[SPEAKER_05]: have we kind of considered a little bit about how that will be sustained in future budgets if the external funding changes at all?

225
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that obviously you listed a little bit earlier that last year's annual calendar listed 200,000 in

226
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:57,189
[SPEAKER_05]: like a net.

227
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:58,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you just kind of thought about that a little bit?

228
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we have.

229
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to have a- That's a great question.

230
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to answer that in twofold.

231
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:07,214
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be, we also are bringing in more revenue.

232
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:10,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've taken 53 people off of the wait list.

233
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:14,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've also increased how much money is coming into that revolving account.

234
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:25,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would say that I have been, I did have a conversation with Andrew Mumford of Basic just to gauge, not that I'm jumping ahead, but just to gauge

235
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:42,552
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in his estimation, what is a prioritized position to be full time, and his top two are the site coordinator position, and then the curriculum developer, like the teacher that's really working on the enrichment activities for students.

236
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:48,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't want to jump ahead, we're just engaging in this consultation with him.

237
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:50,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to try to keep

238
00:18:51,515 --> 00:19:00,360
[SPEAKER_01]: pace for what we really do believe our Metro families deserve in continuing to increase the capacity and making sure we have the programming and the coverage.

239
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:09,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Having additional time for people to just work on staffing and hiring and some of those logistics is real and would be helpful.

240
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

241
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And does this take things off of our director's plate?

242
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides assistance for sure.

243
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:37,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives her an additional layer of partnership when it comes to just the basic supply needs of the schools, the ordering, the hiring, the maintaining of staff, and keeping communications with City Year.

244
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:41,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

245
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:43,007
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

246
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to approve?

247
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

248
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:52,244

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it turns out I am unmuted.
