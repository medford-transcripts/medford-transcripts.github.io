    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=255.893">I'm</a>  on mute and I don't have my camera on, I have no idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=258.054">I</a>  think it's when I left the room, it must do that by default. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=261.596">Anyways,</a>  we don't have anybody who wants to speak, I see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=268.558">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=269.939">Before</a>  you call the roll, just in case anybody catches this recording later, I just wanted to thank the members of the paraprofessional union for a really collaborative conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=282.93">This</a>  contract, there's actually two contracts, a one year deal and a three year deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=288.214">And</a>  it includes the extension of the school day, which we've been talking so much about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=293.899">And</a>  so with this contract, <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=295.42">The</a>  paraprofessionals will be ready and with us as we step off in the new year, which we're really excited about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=302.304">We</a>  are trying to fix some of the problems of practice that we see with our paraprofessionals around when they're being asked to cover for different obligations during the school day that are outside of their job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=315.012">And</a>  the thing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=316.273">Where</a>  I'm truly the most excited about is the creation of some flexible time from our paraprofessionals to help us do the things that don't <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=326.757">Get</a>  done so consistently in the district today and, um, you know, I think we all heard from members of the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=333.161">A</a>  couple of months back about the need for bus monitors, so this contract will allow us some flexibility to deploy professionals among other kinds of duties after school events after school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=350.051">you</a>  know, parent nights, those kinds of things, but also to be able to support our students on the bus while they're in transit when we have like hot spots or flashpoints in the year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=362.058">Not</a>  all bus rides are created equal and we want to make sure that they're all like safe and welcoming spaces for students. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=367.561">So</a>  I'm really excited about all of that in addition to, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=375.065">increases</a>  that reflect this committee's work to make sure that our staff all are paid a wage that is livable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=384.834">We've</a>  made huge strides there over the last six years, and this contract continues to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=390.2">So</a>  thank you to the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=391.741">Thank</a>  you to the paraprofessionals union. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=393.963">I'm</a>  really excited about this and I think the people who are the most excited about this or the payroll office, because they will be able to process this without having to do retroactive pay before the year starts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=405.432">So,</a>  everyone's everyone wins. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=409.075">Thank</a>  you to everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=410.396">And</a>  number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=411.417">So,</a>  can you call it?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=424.296">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=425.337">Members</a>  say yes and Mayor Lengelkern is absent.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=429.34">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=432.123">The</a>  motion is approved and the contract is ratified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=436.226">So</a>  we will let the paraprofessionals unit know and congratulations to everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=444.207">We</a>  have one more agenda item this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=447.548">Dr.</a>  Galusi, I'm going to turn it over to you for agenda item number five, after school site coordinator positions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=455.649">Take</a>  it away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=456.63">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=457.09">I'm</a>  going to try here to first just share my screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=461.571">I</a>  know that you all received, I shared this with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=466.852">Can</a>  you see my screen right now?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=471.173">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=472.113">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=473.551">Hold</a>  on one second, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=485.237">Okay,</a>  so we have been, as this body knows, we have been really looking at trying to increase our capacity here for our after-school programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=500.127">To</a>  date, we have removed 53 students from the wait list since last school year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=508.472">So</a>  we also, just as a reminder for people that are maybe just joining this meeting now, we are engaging in a consultation with BASIC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=518.458">We</a>  are going to one of the very first school committee meetings, present what that might look like, and ask for a vote for that to engage in that consultancy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=528.963">So</a>  we don't want to be doing too much to our staffing ahead of being able to have that gathered data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=537.568">But</a>  as we're bringing on a new track, which is an early pickup time at 4 p.m., that new track has allowed us to be continuing to clear space off of the wait list, because when families elect for a 4 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=554.179">pickup</a>  time, in some cases it has opened up a 6 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=558.762">slot</a>  that we can then fill. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=560.863">In</a>  order to keep <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=562.624">forward</a>  momentum going without going too far ahead as we're engaging in a consultancy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=570.739">We</a>  are here to ask for the possibility of adding, which would be, well, increasing two site coordinator positions from the part-time that they are now to full-time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=585.147">So</a>  really what the request is is just what it would look like in the budget, which I will talk about, which is a revolving account. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=595.093">it</a>  would just double what we're doing now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=597.135">So</a>  what the positions would consist of, there's four site coordinators, one for each building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=603.382">This</a>  would be for two site coordinators only that would partner with all four schools to just help out with some of the logistics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=613.849">Their</a>  year would be, there's a breakdown here, so you could see it would be 220 days, which consists of the 180 days of school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=622.772">We're</a>  hoping to add some school vacation programming to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=629.434">Time</a>  for the before and the end of school summer programming, as well as professional development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=634.936">They</a>  would be working eight-hour days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=641.355">$36.93</a>  an hour. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=644.583">Some</a>  of the roles that it would be, another happy piece is that our partnership with City Year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=650.82">is</a>  expanding a bit and they also are getting into the afterschool game and we are getting five city year employees that are separate from our core members that will be working in our McGlynn and our Missituk schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=668.835">And</a>  so those additional, so <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=671.655">We</a>  are getting 15 core members between the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and the McGlynn Elementary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=677.999">Those</a>  core members also work in the afterschool at the end of the day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=682.222">In</a>  addition to those core members, we are also getting five additional staff members for afterschool care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=690.107">coverage</a>  at the Missituk and the McGlynn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=693.21">So</a>  to kind of just help with a lot of these logistics in trying to increase capacity, working with our partner city here, and just assisting with some of the operational day-to-day pieces, it would be helpful to be able to elevate two of those positions right now to full-time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=715.162">which</a>  is in keeping with the model that BASIC does use. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=720.031">So</a>  at the end of the day, <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=724.583">I'll</a>  just kind of highlight here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=726.565">Right</a>  now, site coordinators are currently budgeted to earn $41,277.90, and if these two positions are created, there'd be an additional cost to the budget of $47,504. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=746.445">So</a>  as I previously mentioned, the afterschool is a revolving account. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=752.969">The</a>  budget can handle this increase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=756.331">And</a>  so we are here to ask if that would be a possibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=762.095">And</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=770.48">Does</a>  this change benefits eligibility for anyone? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=774.802">What</a>  does this do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=776.803">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=777.023">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=779.045">I'm</a>  sure I have more questions, but I will.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=783.448">Member</a>  Tapa.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=784.829">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=785.389">Are</a>  these positions, the two site coordinators that are being brought to this role, are they already inhabited roles? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=792.975">And</a>  are these folks getting promotions or are these positions that need to be reposted and reapplied?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=799.608">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=800.688">We're</a>  not looking to create a new position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=803.769">So</a>  right now we have four site coordinators that work the duration of the school year, and they work part time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=811.191">And</a>  so what this would do would be creating two of those positions, ideally one at one of the title one buildings and one at one of the non title one buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=822.434">And</a>  that would just mean that they are now working full time instead of part time.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=826.835">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=827.388">And</a>  then so are these jobs going to be posted and then those four folks are going to apply? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=832.974">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=833.454">Or</a>  is it going to be that they're posted, but then the job is posted to the public with preference to the four folks that are already employed?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=844.765">Ideally,</a>  it would be an internal posting where out of the four.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=850.09">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=851.011">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=851.672">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=855.863">Any</a>  other questions from the committee?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=857.584">Is</a>  there a, oh, Member Reinfeld? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=866.909">Yeah,</a>  just a little bit of clarification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=869.47">It's</a>  a little bit on the side here on the city year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=872.952">So</a>  previously, you said we're getting more city year people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=878.165">Are</a>  those more people being paid for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=882.007">As</a>  I recall, we were splitting the city year, we were paying for city year partly out of afterschool, but not entirely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=888.709">Correct,</a>  that's still the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=891.21">So,</a>  but these new folks that are coming in is exclusively on the afterschool or are we?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=897.013">No,</a>  so, no, correct, no, it is not exclusively on the afterschool, it's still the same split. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=904.376">Okay,</a>  so our city year line item did go up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=909.962">No,</a>  we maintained the same price as we did last year.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=915.546">But</a>  for more people.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=917.908">Yes,</a>  they have more people that they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=920.509">So</a>  I believe, don't quote me, but I believe that we had about 11 core members last year, and now we're going to have 15 core members.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=930.856">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=931.597">For</a>  the same price. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=933.198">For</a>  the same price. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=934.238">I</a>  wish everything worked that way.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=937.643">But</a>  they're still being paid a reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=939.384">This</a>  was one of our concerns a year ago was that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=942.506">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=943.147">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=943.607">Compensation</a>  was they're able to live or near Medford or Boston.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=951.232">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=951.692">We</a>  did not go up in price. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=953.133">It's</a>  the same exact cost as it was last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=957.976">But</a>  I would say that <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=961.928">I</a>  think that is a benefit to Medford Public Schools because we are getting it at a slightly discounted rate than what maybe other districts are typically charged for city year.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=973.611">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=973.891">And</a>  then are we confident we will be able to offer vacation week programming for this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=978.652">Because</a>  I see those days in there and not that we don't have plenty of work that people can do for eight days, but</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=987.664">It</a>  is a goal of ours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=989.485">So</a>  I think what we probably would not start with the December break. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=994.148">I</a>  think that's the one where we have a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=996.61">Yeah,</a>  there's a lot of families that have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1000.582">vacation</a>  times and things coming up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1002.463">I</a>  think our goal would be to target the February and April break. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1006.566">That's</a>  how I was reading the eight days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1009.168">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1010.169">But</a>  I just wanna make sure that that's- And I'm very sorry, there's an excessive amount of emergency vehicles that are reporting to the high school right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1019.976">I'm</a>  a little distracted and I might- Do you know why? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1024.819">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1026.42">I'm</a>  hoping it's not the woods again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1030.621">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1034.106">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1035.508">You</a>  can go check that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1036.63">Do</a>  you want us to do a motion?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1041.947">Well,</a>  see I had a question but now I'm worried that the superintendent may have to attend to that so my question can be asked, it's just okay, it's okay I can multitask right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1051.397">Okay,</a>  so it's just a quick question just so I have it in my brain so for the two new positions be incorporated for the site coordinator responsibilities in the budget, the additional $47,500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1062.449">have</a>  we kind of considered a little bit about how that will be sustained in future budgets if the external funding changes at all? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1069.039">I</a>  know that obviously you listed a little bit earlier that last year's annual calendar listed 200,000 in <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1076.548">like</a>  a net. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1077.489">So</a>  have you just kind of thought about that a little bit? <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1078.93">I'm</a>  sure we have.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1079.47">I</a>  just want to have a- That's a great question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1081.531">So</a>  I'm going to answer that in twofold. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1084.253">One</a>  would be, we also are bringing in more revenue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1087.274">I</a>  mean, we've taken 53 people off of the wait list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1090.816">So</a>  we've also increased how much money is coming into that revolving account. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1095.399">And</a>  then I would say that I have been, I did have a conversation with Andrew Mumford of Basic just to gauge, not that I'm jumping ahead, but just to gauge <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1106.065">you</a>  know, in his estimation, what is a prioritized position to be full time, and his top two are the site coordinator position, and then the curriculum developer, like the teacher that's really working on the enrichment activities for students. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1122.632">And</a>  I really don't want to jump ahead, we're just engaging in this consultation with him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1129.514">But</a>  just to try to keep <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1131.515">pace</a>  for what we really do believe our Metro families deserve in continuing to increase the capacity and making sure we have the programming and the coverage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1141.66">Having</a>  additional time for people to just work on staffing and hiring and some of those logistics is real and would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1153.186">And</a>  does this take things off of our director's plate?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1159.707">It</a>  provides assistance for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/school-committee-special-meeting-08-13-25&start=1162.71">It</a>  gives her an additional layer of partnership when it comes to just the basic supply needs of the schools, the ordering, the hiring, the maintaining of staff, and keeping communications with City Year.</p>
