1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:44,844
All right, thank you so much for being with me here today.

10
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:48,806
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:49,947
Yeah, sure.

12
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:51,848
Hi, I'm Jimmy Matichak Morris.

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,589
My pronouns are he and him.

14
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,652
And I'm an author for middle grade readers and also young adults.

15
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,513
I'm originally from New Jersey.

16
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,635
I grew up as the middle child of five.

17
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,997
And so we had a very busy household.

18
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:14,981
And I always knew that I wanted to do something creative, didn't quite know what that looked like.

19
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:22,246
And so after many years of trying different medias and different things, I wound up being an author.

20
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:23,687
Thank you, Jimmy.

21
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,789
So yeah, I'm really happy to have you here and to hear more about your upcoming book.

22
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:36,294
Before we do that, I'd like to ask you the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

23
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:44,066
I would say Colleen's and just anything ice cream related is my favorite thing to eat there.

24
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:49,028
Probably the peanut butter sundae is my absolute favorite thing there.

25
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:51,409
It's so good.

26
00:01:51,449 --> 00:02:00,233
Today, so the college that I went to every fall, there's something called Mountain Day where they surprise you by canceling class and the president of the college serves ice cream on top of a mountain.

27
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:05,657
And that's actually, yeah, it's always a nice surprise, especially if you haven't done your homework for that day.

28
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:07,338
But today is Mountain Day.

29
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,381
So we're going to go to Colleen's tonight, actually, to celebrate.

30
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:19,728
So yeah, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of how you became an author and kind of what that looked like for you.

31
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:20,488
Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:25,132
So as I said in my little intro, I always knew that I wanted to do something creative.

33
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,134
So as a kid, I did art.

34
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,855
I did a lot of drawing.

35
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,057
I thought maybe I wanted to be a cartoonist or an animator.

36
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:36,060
And I kind of went in stages.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,100
And then I did theater.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,161
I was a theater kid.

39
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,305
And then I realized that I was way too shy to be on the stage.

40
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:50,090
And so probably towards early high school, I realized that maybe I'm a behind-the-scenes person because

41
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,989
being on stage just terrifies me all of a sudden.

42
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:55,730
What else did I do?

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,490
I did film.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,171
So I went to college and I studied film.

45
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,493
And so I did a little bit of screenwriting there.

46
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:07,195
And I also, I got a degree in film and then another degree in English.

47
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:11,697
And so that's when I sort of started to really dive into writing and creative writing.

48
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:15,638
And I think that's sort of where I hit the switch.

49
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:18,159
Like, oh yes, I can be an author.

50
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,640
I can be this sort of like,

51
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,661
actor with words, and I can be shy at the same time.

52
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,502
So I just write a book all by myself.

53
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:34,484
I get these characters' emotions and all the things that I would do as an actor, but then I can just push it away and not watch anyone as they read it.

54
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:38,726
So I think that's sort of where I wound up as an author.

55
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:47,629
I think I also just always wanted to write for kids rather than adults, partially because I think I read more for kids than adults.

56
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:55,771
way books I find accessible and I'm a little bit of a slow reader so I feel like I can get more reading done.

57
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,092
I read middle grade and young adult books.

58
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:05,755
And so I think I just always was interested in the media, the literature that I had growing up and I was like I want to

59
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:09,136
I want to participate in that body of work.

60
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:12,778
And so it's always been children's literature for me.

61
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:17,660
So after college, I went to grad school at Simmons College.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,761
It's why I moved to the Massachusetts area.

63
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:24,083
They're one of the few programs in children's literature and writing for children.

64
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:30,205
So that's where I actually started my debut novel, My Ex-Imaginary Friend.

65
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:32,987
This was 2007, so this was a long time ago.

66
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,888
But my first class was just called, I think, Writing I.

67
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:42,452
And it was taught by Joan Knowles, who's this really wonderful YA author.

68
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,134
And her first book actually came out the year that we had her class.

69
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,656
It was a super exciting time.

70
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:51,418
And she was just a super nurturing, supportive mentor.

71
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:56,842
And so I wrote the first maybe five chapters with my ex-imaginary friend in that class.

72
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,264
And she was always so supportive, like, oh, keep going.

73
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,605
This is really good.

74
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,906
I want you to keep finishing it.

75
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:06,488
I did, eventually.

76
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:11,233
I think one thing for me for writing novels, sometimes I'll just have to walk away and then pick it up again.

77
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:17,098
So I stuck with it eventually and that became my debut novel after all those years.

78
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,020
I really enjoyed that novel.

79
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:26,046
I also love YA and read books for younger people and I feel like that book

80
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:37,085
For me, it felt like a really digestible way to think about mental health for kids and maybe in a way they maybe aren't understanding it at the time.

81
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,767
I don't know, do you want to say a little bit about what the book's about?

82
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:45,150
Yeah, so my best imaginary friend is about an 11-year-old boy named Jack.

83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,016
who used to have an imaginary friend, and then he kind of grows out of him, and the imaginary friend, George, is this part walrus.

84
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,077
He just disappears.

85
00:05:54,498 --> 00:06:11,513
And then Jack's family begins to disappear in more real-world ways, like his father walks out on the family, and his mother's having some mental health issues, and so she kind of drops Jack off at his aunt's house, and she disappears, and he realizes that maybe

86
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:17,437
Everyone is disappearing on me, and so maybe to make sense of it, I need to find my former imaginary friend.

87
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:22,440
And he can give me peace and family and just comfort.

88
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:36,970
And so he kind of goes on this journey to find his former imaginary friend, who is meanwhile sort of out on his own, wondering what is the point of an imaginary friend without a person to imagine them.

89
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,293
And so it alternates points of view between the two as they

90
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,876
find one another and then I guess find themselves also.

91
00:06:44,616 --> 00:07:04,815
Yeah, I feel like there's kind of two important ways to read that book, like as a child and also as a parent, like my son's name is also Jack, so it's kind of fun, but like, but also like, you know, there's like very sad parts to the book, but sort of like I think forgetting as an adult that kids do have like an important perspective and understanding and like sometimes

92
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:09,676
It feels like there's no way to like bridge what a child understands with what an adult understands.

93
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:19,379
So it's like a nice reminder like I think there's like some scenes like between the cousins that are also really nice in that book where they're sort of supporting each other in a very sweet way, but yeah, I really enjoyed it.

94
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,659
Yeah, and I work in mental health as well.

95
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,560
So it's like always nice to be able to have like

96
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,844
something to reference or like get people to say like, yeah, this could help you to think about what you're going through.

97
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:43,135
Yeah, I definitely wrote, I feel like I wrote all of my books for myself or for the younger version of myself who, you know, is experiencing issues with mental health and didn't have the words to articulate them.

99
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:50,921
And what we'll get to foresee from that is also a little bit of me figuring out like what I could have used as a child.

100
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:51,522
And so,

101
00:07:52,362 --> 00:08:12,780
I definitely try to touch upon some heavier subjects, but I also like to talk about humor, which in My Ex-Magic Friend, the character of George, who's the part of Walrus, is very funny, very optimistic, and so I hope that they create a balance so that it's not all just a sad book.

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,102
There's hope, there's humor, there's heart.

103
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:16,226
Yeah.

104
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:19,388
Yeah, it's nice to hear kind of what you hope for people to take.

105
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:19,768
Yeah.

106
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:20,168
Yeah.

107
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:20,889
Great.

108
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:26,912
And so I just wonder if, too, like, it sounds like any kind of creative career could be tough, right?

109
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:38,198
Like, there seems like there could be some important supports in your life, like people that are, like, things that help to support your work, but also maybe some things that have felt hard or, like, barriers to your work.

110
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,359
I wonder if you could share that.

111
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,420
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,741
So in terms of support, my family, my husband,

113
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,343
So supportive, he's read every draft.

114
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:55,505
I'll like change a few sentences and then I'll send him a text and be like, can you read these two sentences and tell me which one is better?

115
00:08:56,445 --> 00:09:00,086
He's read everything that I've read.

116
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,746
So I would say that he's my biggest support.

117
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:05,107
I did, I dedicated the first book to him because of that.

118
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:10,609
Just reading any, any word that I've read and supportive, but also

119
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:16,370
firm, constructive, you know, when needed.

120
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,412
So I think that's been really helpful.

121
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:34,684
I think one of the things that's really hard, but one of the holdups, probably myself, is sometimes, like if I'm not, some people, some authors are like, oh, you need to write every day, and I don't necessarily do that.

122
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,026
When I'm in the zone, I can do that, but sometimes,

123
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:46,293
I'll miss a day or a week or longer, and then I start to get in my head, and I'm like, oh, I'm not an author.

124
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:46,973
What am I doing?

125
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:47,854
What's wrong with me?

126
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:57,381
And so I feel like when I get in my head, that's one of my biggest holdups, is just not being able to push myself out of that.

127
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:05,107
And I feel like that's another way that my husband has been really helpful, because I'll just be on the couch, wrapped up in a blanket, being like, oh, I'm done.

128
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:24,214
I'm not an author to be like, okay, let's sit by the computer for five minutes with a word doc, or he'll encourage me, he'll let me have the space to be dramatic and say that I'm quitting, but then he'll be like, all right, let's

129
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,095
Let's think, do you actually want to quit?

130
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:28,976
Because I'll support you if you do.

131
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:35,638
But would you like to just sit with the computer for five, ten minutes?

132
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,379
He's a good balance and a good support.

133
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:46,182
Yeah, I wonder too, are there any YA authors that you kind of draw creative inspiration from?

134
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,564
Yeah, I love a lot of authors.

135
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:56,106
I wrote down a lot of those songs, because I always forget when I ask.

136
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,867
But I love especially queer authors.

137
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:04,388
There's been so much more queer literature lately, which is really great.

138
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:09,890
So Adam Sass is someone, he wrote

139
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:22,254
Surrender Your Sons, which is about, it's a YA, and it's parents, or mother sends her kid to a conversion camp, and the kid has to then sort of escape the conversion camp.

140
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,495
So it's intense, but it's really good.

141
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:35,279
And then at the same time, he also wrote one called The 99 Boyfriends of Micah Summers, and that's sort of a YA, Cinderella, rom-com type of book.

142
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,680
It's very queer, very good.

143
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:43,202
One of the best books that I've read lately, I think, is We Deserve Monuments by Jazz Hammons.

144
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:47,063
Let's see what other authors do I have.

145
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,004
Adam Silvera.

146
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,464
I'm trying to think now.

147
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:54,225
Is that the Dante and Aristotle author?

148
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:59,047
Adam Silvera wrote More Happy Than Not.

149
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,748
I think he wrote a blurb for Dante and Aristotle.

150
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:03,548
I'm not sure.

151
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:04,068
I'm not sure.

152
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:04,368
Yeah.

153
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,809
What else has he written?

154
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,049
He wrote They Both Died.

155
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:20,511
Any one who's emerging in the queer author field, I just really love to be immersed in those books.

156
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:21,492
Thank you.

157
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:24,492
And obviously, there is a queer theme to For Sooth.

158
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,233
So what do you want us to know about your new book?

159
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:32,294
Yeah, so For Sooth is about 13-year-old Calvin Conroy.

160
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:35,274
He is a theater kid.

161
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:39,115
He wants to be a star on the stage.

162
00:12:41,350 --> 00:13:03,066
He has some anxiety, some stage fright, and in the middle of the school show, he gets caught up, and he can't remember his lines, and he starts to sort of have this nervous panic attack, and he ends up falling off the stage, and his mind ruining the entire school show.

163
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:09,890
And so, that's the prologue of the book, and after that, the rest of the book is him trying to

164
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:32,470
repair his reputation, trying to prove that he is an actor and a good friend and he didn't ruin the show, also while sort of encountering or realizing that he's experiencing his first gay crushes, while living in a Catholic religious home and thinking that like, wait, this is impossible, what's going on?

165
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:47,799
And so it's somewhat of a love triangle, while also very much about theater kids and resilience and overcoming stage fright and realizing maybe that your mistakes are not quite as bad as they are in your mind.

166
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:51,761
Yeah, and there's the, like, female best friend character.

167
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:56,984
It's like something that... Yes, so his best friend is named Kennedy Carmichael, and she is

168
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:03,851
Perhaps a more talented actress, we'll say, and she was the star of the show that he fumbled.

169
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:04,712
She was Cinderella.

170
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:14,121
And so she decides to apply to this acting school in New York City, and she gets in.

171
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:17,104
And so at the beginning of the summer, she reveals that she's going to be leaving.

172
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:23,010
he realizes that nobody looks at him without Kennedy, because he's always sort of in the back of her spotlight.

173
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,513
And so he decides that he's got to convince her to stay.

174
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:33,399
And so he gathers the rest of his friends together to make a movie that's going to be so amazing.

175
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,762
It's going to convince her, oh, wow, I was wrong to leave.

176
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:40,205
And so throughout the story, they're making this film, which is

177
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:41,706
Well, not very good.

178
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:47,952
But they really think it's going to just convince her that this is where it's at.

179
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:53,698
Yeah, I liked that it was, I mean, I remember like 13 is what, like 7th or 8th grade?

180
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:54,278
Yeah, 7th.

181
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:57,862
So in the book they've just finished 7th grade and they're in the summer right before 8th.

182
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:02,446
Yeah, I remember seventh grade is like one of the worst years of my life socially.

183
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:14,939
Like that, I feel like that really brought out that anxiety and worry about friendships, like this person is the most important person to me in the world and if they leave then I'll be like, what would that mean for me?

184
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,321
And I really like that like some of the

185
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:22,546
book is written like through text messages or unanswered text messages, I really like that part.

186
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:26,248
There's a lot of unanswered texts in the very dramatic case.

187
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:34,955
Yeah, it felt like it really evoked a lot of feelings from middle school, which for better or worse, but I feel like that's a powerful book that can do that for sure.

188
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:35,796
Yeah.

189
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:42,101
And there was also like a religious component, right, to his sort of identity formation in the book.

190
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:53,769
Yeah, so growing up, I grew up in a Catholic, more conservative household too, and so there's a little bit of my sort of anxieties of being religious and gay.

191
00:15:53,789 --> 00:16:02,076
So there was a lot less media, I would say, when I was growing up, you know, when I was about this age.

192
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:10,644
I didn't really know that being gay was even a thing, and so I experienced

193
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:17,915
I feel like really intense crushes, but didn't know that I was experiencing crushes.

194
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,220
So I thought they were like really explosive friendships.

195
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,564
awkward, uncomfortable, confusing friendships.

196
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:34,591
And so I had several of these before I even saw a gay character or knew what that was.

197
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:44,880
I feel like I kind of figured things out a little bit more in high school, but I didn't actually come out or finalize my coming out until after college.

198
00:16:48,394 --> 00:17:01,378
There's definitely a little bit of my upbringing in this book as like denial and confusion and just fear about what is going on.

199
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:07,140
I don't understand this friendship or why it's going in this direction when that doesn't feel right.

200
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,021
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:14,163
And there's a lot of kind of like complexity to like all the family relationships, like the two different

202
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:20,306
Like the two boys in his life, and then Kennedy, and I also love the older sister character.

203
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:25,128
Sort of just like, I feel like she's a really important character for Calvin.

204
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:26,108
It's very sweet.

205
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,689
I don't want to give away too much of the plot.

206
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:31,670
Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of my sister in that sister character.

207
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,271
And I dedicated this book to my sister.

208
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,792
Hopefully she's not listening until she reads the book.

209
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,893
Yeah, there's definitely a lot of that.

210
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:44,956
Like there's teasing between the siblings until maybe it's not time to tease.

211
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:50,218
So I think that's what I was going for with that relationship.

212
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:57,041
Yeah, and I wonder kind of what you hope for people to take from this book, either parents or youth that are reading it.

213
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:58,462
Yeah.

214
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:12,844
So I feel like, again, I wrote this book for me or for someone like me, and so I would like someone who reads this book, especially a young reader, to take away, you know, oh, I'm not alone.

215
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,705
There's kids like me who are

216
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:22,111
having these thoughts that are confusing and that things are going to be okay.

217
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:35,581
Yeah, I liked that, I mean, I'm not going to say too much, but there were some like kind of, not surprises, but I kind of like a book where you can look back at the opening scene and have a different understanding of it by the end.

218
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,982
Yeah, I did.

219
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:43,231
and plant some seeds in them for a while that are addressed later throughout especially.

220
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:44,673
Yeah, great.

221
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,188
Anything else you want to say about the book or maybe where we can find it when it comes out?

222
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:55,790
Yeah, so it comes out November 7th, which is Tuesday.

223
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,272
You can find it anywhere that books are sold, Barnes & Noble, a local bookshop.

224
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,433
If they don't carry it, you can ask them to carry it.

225
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,954
There's a website called bookshop.org where you can

226
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:13,916
I think that's where you can kind of buy from your local bookstore, but it's online.

227
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,297
Also, Amazon, if that's where you want to get books, that's fine.

228
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,057
It's there as well.

229
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:25,978
Yeah, and I'm also doing an event on November 11th.

230
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:28,019
It's a Saturday at 3.

231
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:33,020
It's an acting at the Silver Unicorn, which is a local acting bookstore.

232
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,700
It's very cute.

233
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,421
So I'll be doing an event there.

234
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,843
I don't quite know what it's going to look like yet.

235
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,905
I have to plan that in the next few months.

236
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:42,527
But there will be an event.

237
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:43,027
I'll be there.

238
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,148
I can sign.

239
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:45,109
Great.

240
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:50,253
Yeah, I've had a lot of luck at Porter Square Books requesting books, and they seem to get them in pretty quickly.

241
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:50,994
Yeah, they do.

242
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:54,116
I think they have signed copies of my ex-imaginary friend there.

243
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,879
I'll try to get some signed copies of her suit as well.

244
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,920
Great, yeah.

245
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,321
So anything else you want to plug?

246
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:01,542
So it sounds like you have two events.

247
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:02,383
The book's coming out.

248
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,807
Can we find your first book at all the same?

249
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:08,832
Yes, so you can find my first book at all those same places as well.

250
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,537
Check it out at your local library, it would be great.

251
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:16,142
Yeah, I think that's it.

252
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:20,147
We'll see, depending on how sales are.

253
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:24,450
I'm hoping to write a sequel at some point, but we'll see.

254
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,890
It'll depend on how the first one does.

255
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:32,754
But there are some, I won't say anything, but there are some unanswered questions, I think, that could be addressed in a sequel.

256
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:39,877
I know I've been, well, I read the Heartstopper series, and then, yeah, and they made a Netflix show about it.

257
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:46,480
But I feel like that's one that's been, it's been fun to follow them as they get older in that story.

258
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,281
So it'll be interesting to see Calvin in high school.

259
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,263
Yeah.

260
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:52,045
Awesome.

261
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:57,336
Well, thank you so much for joining me and good luck with the book.

262
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:58,078
