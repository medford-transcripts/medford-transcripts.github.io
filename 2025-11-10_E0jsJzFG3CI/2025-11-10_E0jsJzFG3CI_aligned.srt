00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:30,441
Hello everyone and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the City of Medford.

2
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,584
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:43,953
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:58,543
We have not one but two very special guests, Nell Escobar-Cokley and Chris Stevens, the founders of Guttano-Metford.

5
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:11,972
And they will be sharing their thoughts on the results of the recent elections for the Method City Council, school committee, and also we'll discuss the revised city charter.

6
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:19,526
So, I also want to mention that Wendell Waters was supposed to join us today.

7
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:23,367
We're going to miss her, but she couldn't join us.

8
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:30,088
So, unfortunately, she's also with Guttenroh Medford.

9
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,268
So, okay, we'll start right off.

10
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,089
We'll begin by looking at the candidates who won.

11
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,990
And, you know, why do you think they were successful?

12
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,334
get the, how did they win, what did they do?

13
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:48,696
I think you can't fault the machine.

14
00:01:49,136 --> 00:02:03,403
I mean, our Revolution Medford is, all of them are our Revolution Medford winners, with the exception of George Scarpelli, which they sort of noted on their website when they said that we won 12 out of 13 seats.

15
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:03,824
Right.

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,385
I can only assume the seat they did not win was George's.

17
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:11,688
But, you know, I mean, I think, like I said, I mean, they're a machine.

18
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:13,449
They were prepared.

19
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,191
They knew what they were going to do.

20
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,474
They worked as a team, as a block, and they pulled that off.

21
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:25,522
You know, were you surprised at all by how good some of the candidates finished?

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,331
Yeah, I thought they did extremely well.

23
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:34,154
I thought there was a really good supply of candidates this time around.

24
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:36,114
They were a lot of really good people.

25
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,375
They had really great ideas.

26
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,596
They were really well informed.

27
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,156
They all worked really hard.

28
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,617
They showed up for events.

29
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,058
They answered questions.

30
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,060
they went out and hit the pavement.

31
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,604
So, I don't think Medford was at a loss for, you know, any good candidate.

32
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:53,527
And I'm not just talking about the incumbents, I'm talking about the- No, the challengers were great.

33
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:56,710
The independent slate, there were a lot of really good people.

34
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:57,471
Yeah.

35
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,292
A lot to choose from.

36
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,054
Yeah, that's what I felt, yeah.

37
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:08,041
And I thought they did well, and I mean, I was surprised by the results.

38
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:08,642
Were you guys-

39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:09,923
I don't know.

40
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,244
I don't know if I was surprised.

41
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,985
I mean, once you get in, you're an incumbent.

42
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,648
Sometimes it's, it's, it's, you know, they hang out of those seats sometimes.

43
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,570
Yeah, it can sometimes be difficult to balance them.

44
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,834
You know, I mean, from our standpoint, it's always a little disappointing.

45
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:26,415
We want to see new people come in there.

46
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:28,857
We want to see somebody come in and shake things up.

47
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:29,157
Right.

48
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:34,001
So we're like, oh, yeah, we got, you know, but but Liz is in and that's great.

49
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:34,181
Or

50
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,782
Miranda, I don't know.

51
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:44,569
It's it's close right now and historically in Medford You have people who have been in those seats once like it's hard to shake out an incumbent, right?

52
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:53,936
Usually when you shake out an incumbent is when someone leaves retires they leave they go do something else and that's usually when you've seen those big changes so without

53
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:59,318
You know, with an empty seat, I thought for sure we would see at least two more new people.

54
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,578
I mean, there were so many.

55
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:03,179
There were so many people.

56
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,820
It was 17 to begin with for City Council.

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,401
I mean, oh, good Lord, as a reporter, that is like impossible to cover, to write about, to keep track of.

58
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,302
And even, and I was like, OK, so they're going to have a

59
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,443
I know it's not a primary, a preliminary vote.

60
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,364
You know, that'll knock it down great.

61
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:27,086
Well, it only knocked it down by three, which is, I get that's their city cap, but still, from our standpoint, it's like, oh my God, there's 14 candidates to write about.

62
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,267
And it's going to be more in the next election.

63
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:29,787
Yeah, yes.

64
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,328
Because of the charter, we will have four more people.

65
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:32,928
That's right.

66
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,649
Yeah, I didn't even think of that.

67
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,150
So that, I would think, is going to be a free-for-all.

68
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,592
people coming out to run for that.

69
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,073
And that'll be exciting.

70
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:46,717
Although it's gonna be even more interesting because you're gonna have them in wards.

71
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:51,360
So you're gonna have eight wards and three people who are at large.

72
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,584
So now you're gonna have pockets of the city where you're gonna have those mini battles.

73
00:04:56,965 --> 00:05:01,588
So you can have three or four people running from the eighth precinct or the first precinct.

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,072
So that's gonna be really tricky to see but it'll be like really fun and exciting because we've never done that before.

75
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:15,996
So here's an off-the-cuff question that I don't know because I'm still familiarizing myself with the city and with the wards and precincts.

76
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:20,598
So of the incumbents now, do they cross over in wards?

77
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,776
That's a good question, John, do they?

78
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,457
I believe some of them do.

79
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,319
At least three of them.

80
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,140
That'll be really interesting.

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,801
Maybe four.

82
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,862
Maybe four will cross over.

83
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,264
So that makes it difficult.

84
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:32,504
It does.

85
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:37,768
And I think that's why the old city councils, at some point, that's why they didn't want to switch to each other.

86
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,869
Because they were like, we're in the same ward.

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,611
We don't want to fight each other.

88
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,212
That'll be really interesting.

89
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:44,893
Because I think a few of them are.

90
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:46,674
It's going to be interesting.

91
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:47,314
Well, maybe they'll move.

92
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:52,255
I don't think any of them actually own homes, so they're not tied down to that space.

93
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,996
They could, absolutely.

94
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,856
Yeah, I think maybe two of them do.

95
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:07,919
But anyhow, let's take a look, you know, if you guys can, the support, where their support came from.

96
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,260
Did you notice any strong

97
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:24,297
you know, strong areas of Medford that voted for the independents, we'll call them, or strong areas that went for our revolution.

98
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,917
You've been studying.

99
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,318
No, yeah, but I don't know all the wards and whatnot.

100
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,960
It's interesting, I know, like you very kindly printed out a map.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Right.

102
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:42,283
That it does seem to be like this section with 3-2, Ward 3, Ward 2, what is down here, 4.

103
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,264
They seem to have the highest turnout.

104
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,105
There seemed to be a lot of, that was a very heavy turnout.

105
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:48,405
West Bedford?

106
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:54,307
It seems like the West Bedford Fire Station, they did Our Revolution.

107
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,107
did very well.

108
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,529
There's a lot of younger families that moved into that area.

109
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,870
That's a whole different neighborhood over there.

110
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,391
That makes complete sense.

111
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:09,634
Where the temple is in West Bedford, the independents actually did very good.

112
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:10,054
Really?

113
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,175
Yeah, they did better.

114
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:12,055
Yeah, they did good.

115
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:13,015
They really did.

116
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,056
Well, they were out there too.

117
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,657
Yes, they were out quite a bit.

118
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:21,448
I got to drive around some of the polling locations on Tuesday, and that's what I saw.

119
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:32,711
I saw a lot of people out with signs and then got yelled at because, you know, we took pictures or I took pictures of, you know, the people who were out standing with signs, and they were, quote, unquote, the independent slate.

120
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,771
They had a ton of people out.

121
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:39,733
I didn't see anybody at all at the fire station, but there was a line out the door.

122
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,335
It was a line out the door there.

123
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:43,115
It was crazy.

124
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,978
And the polling areas were all busy.

125
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:51,321
I talked to a lot of the wardens and they were like, it has been like steady, steady all day long.

126
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,422
Yeah, what was the percentage?

127
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:55,064
I feel like the turnout wasn't... Oh, no.

128
00:07:57,383 --> 00:08:04,606
I think the total voters, the total turnout, I have the numbers, 14,175 was your total.

129
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,807
Total vote.

130
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,869
So yeah, total people that voted, not the numbers.

131
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,210
So that was your total number of people.

132
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,201
And this always bothers me.

133
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,201
It always will.

134
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,602
And I can't forgive people.

135
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:19,782
OK, 14,000 is a lot of people.

136
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,003
It's a civic duty to vote.

137
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,783
But that's a lot for Medford.

138
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:24,243
I know.

139
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:24,904
I know.

140
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,665
If you look at Medford's history of voting, this is a lot.

141
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:28,405
I know it is.

142
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:29,786
It's the block.

143
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:33,168
The block came out with at least 7,000 votes for themselves.

144
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:39,754
And compared to the number of registered voters or people of voting age that live here, it's not a lot.

145
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,737
No, it isn't, because you have 44,000 registered voters.

146
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,237
Yeah.

147
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,479
And you had 14,000 people came out.

148
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:48,241
So you have a lot of homeowners.

149
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,622
Our revolution basically run

150
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,704
won with 7,000 votes.

151
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:58,226
They have a solid block of people who will come out.

152
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,367
And if people say, well, we've never seen that.

153
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:01,227
We have seen that.

154
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,027
Yes, we have.

155
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:08,230
We've had Mike McGlynn, who always used to pull out at least 5,000 votes for himself.

156
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,691
You've had that in the past.

157
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:10,731
You've had those blocks.

158
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,092
And you've had what people would refer to as the machine.

159
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,333
And as Chris said, they have a machine.

160
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,854
They have it down pat.

161
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,335
And that's going to be tough.

162
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,475
You know, unless one of them leaves.

163
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,316
Listen, honestly, they're a national organization.

164
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:24,516
They are.

165
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,056
And I don't know where the money comes from.

166
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,557
But we all got how many mailers from them?

167
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,358
I mean, it's incredible.

168
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:33,418
Yeah, they spend money.

169
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,258
And it's not just Medford.

170
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:36,699
I mean, I live in Malden.

171
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,639
Malden's like that now.

172
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,920
You know, it's hard for it's hard for people to get in.

173
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,160
They're getting a lot of money.

174
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,801
It's national money, that's what it is.

175
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,122
Where is it coming from?

176
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:47,542
Yeah, I don't know.

177
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,262
Where is it coming from?

178
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,463
That I don't have any answer.

179
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,404
But we will find out.

180
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:51,904
We will find out.

181
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:52,765
I hope so.

182
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,687
What's interesting is, you know, you say once you get in there, it's tough sometimes to get incumbents out.

183
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,548
And these guys are all young.

184
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:00,309
Yes.

185
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:05,952
So I mean, unless they get bored with the gig, they could potentially be in there for a very long time.

186
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,012
For quite a while.

187
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,953
And you know, and some of them might have bigger ambitions.

188
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,034
We don't know, right?

189
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:11,114
I'm sure they do.

190
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,015
Mr. Bears, are you running for mayor?

191
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,956
I'm sure there's going to be more up the road.

192
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:18,657
I really do.

193
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,278
All right, so let's move on a little bit here now.

194
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:34,783
So your thoughts, and what I'm looking for here, you know, your thoughts, the results of the city council, you know,

195
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:47,390
Moving forward for the city of Medford, you know, we're talking, let's talk budget, zoning, economic development.

196
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:52,172
I mean, they control the whole council.

197
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:53,573
Sure.

198
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,295
Where are they going with these, with the zoning, with the?

199
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,104
What do you think?

200
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,224
What's your opinion?

201
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:08,127
I'm curious to see where the rezoning is going to go because the mayor put the kibosh on that when she declined to further fund their consultant.

202
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,128
So that sort of put the brakes on the six-year journey.

203
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,009
I would assume that city council and the mayor are going to have to come

204
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,296
to some sort of agreement at some point.

205
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:22,658
Either that or it's just going to be dead in the water.

206
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,079
I can't imagine it's going to be dead in the water after all these years.

207
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,140
They had an idea that they worked on for two years.

208
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,423
And they wanted to rezone the entire city at the same time in two years.

209
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,603
And that's crazy.

210
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,705
I mean there are cities that take forever.

211
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,365
They take it one section at a time.

212
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,467
And I think that's why you saw so many independent candidates.

213
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,408
Because people were very upset about it.

214
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:52,995
And then it all seemed to sort of trickle to an end, and then the mayor said, we're not doing this, because she was probably getting complaints, and nobody knew what was going on.

215
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,896
And people weren't getting information.

216
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,498
We're not getting information.

217
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:57,999
We've asked millions of questions.

218
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,020
We've been turned down.

219
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,641
We've asked for sit-downs.

220
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,521
We've asked for meetings.

221
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,023
We've asked for all kinds of things.

222
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,347
And I can't just imagine what that's like for the regular citizen who wants to ask a question and doesn't get it answered.

223
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:14,545
So I think, personally, the mayor was waiting to see where the election went, what shook out.

224
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,225
Definitely.

225
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,946
But it hasn't changed.

226
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:17,707
No.

227
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,788
Nothing's changed.

228
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,810
They will come to some sort of agreement.

229
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,574
I do think there are enough people that are saying, let's just take this a little bit slower.

230
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,756
Let's back the truck up and just take it a little slower.

231
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,057
Even Zach said that.

232
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:32,698
Even Zach?

233
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,079
There's a seven.

234
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:38,282
Now, here's what I, and this is only my opinion,

235
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:46,059
I think that now that the election's over, I mean, I'm just talking zoning.

236
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:47,580
The election's over.

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,706
Before the election, I think they realized that, wow, the pushback they got on the zoning.

238
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:07,834
So I think they realized that, the pushback they were getting, so they slowed down the zoning and everything.

239
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:15,758
But now that they're elected and they're back in office, I hate to see it.

240
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,019
I think they're going to go full steam.

241
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,441
But she has to give them money.

242
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,784
No, no, I understand all that.

243
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,306
That's what I'm getting at.

244
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,092
you know, boom, boom, boom, and it's going to happen.

245
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:33,255
Or the mayor may end up, I don't know what the word is, going to battle with them.

246
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:33,976
I don't know.

247
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,217
They have the plan.

248
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:36,377
They have their planning board, right?

249
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,399
And that board, by the way, November 18.

250
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:38,899
Right?

251
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,261
They're having yes, yeah, they open house and open house.

252
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:46,504
Yeah, which you know, if you're concerned about zoning, my thing is go go go to that.

253
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:47,205
It's from

254
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,939
47.

255
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,939
Sorry, Chris just told me this today.

256
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,339
She made me say I'm going.

257
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,700
Told us she had to go.

258
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,981
But we're going, right?

259
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:01,305
And we encourage people to go and to ask those questions and to say to the mayor, I want you to take this slow.

260
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:07,650
We've asked that board for a sit down and we got a lot of like nothing, silent.

261
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,251
But they're going to have to answer these questions.

262
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,832
They're going to have to answer the questions.

263
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,454
And I know you guys get silence.

264
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,256
Most of the city gets silence.

265
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,713
You know, I have to ask this.

266
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:22,093
Why?

267
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,474
What's the problem?

268
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,797
Like, why can't they just come out?

269
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,418
I mean, either way.

270
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,280
They're not used to having a newspaper.

271
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,682
And they're not used to having to answer to anything.

272
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,844
They don't think they have to answer to anybody.

273
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,366
But we're here now.

274
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:43,011
And so we didn't come in early enough in this election to probably have any kind of an impact.

275
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,334
But the next time that there is an election, we are here.

276
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,717
And they might want to take that into account.

277
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,099
It's going to be interesting.

278
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:50,780
I do have to say.

279
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,446
It's going to be interesting because we can report on the fact that nobody's getting any information about anything.

280
00:14:55,486 --> 00:15:01,594
They did actually, they were very good about returning candidate questionnaires that we did send out.

281
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,936
So we were able to put that together.

282
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:07,578
The council is pretty good about getting back to us.

283
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,379
Not always timely, but they do get back to us.

284
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,700
The mayor's office does not really answer much of anything.

285
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,960
They like to issue press releases, but they don't.

286
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,241
They issue a lot of press releases.

287
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:19,461
They do.

288
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:27,502
And I think that the answer going forward for us is on our stories that we'll be saying we reached out to so and so at this office and they did not return calls.

289
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,543
This is my favorite thing to write.

290
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,203
No, I hear you.

291
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,304
We asked everybody.

292
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,345
As you know, we did a lot of political shows.

293
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:35,945
You did, yeah.

294
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:36,125
Yes.

295
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:40,046
And I'm sort of, you know, we're going to... Step away from that.

296
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,767
Get away from the politics now.

297
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,628
I'm looking forward to some of the shows we're going to be doing, believe me.

298
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:53,150
But, you know, we invited everybody, and, you know, the ones that came on came on, but same thing.

299
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,731
It's like a lot of people just...

300
00:15:56,491 --> 00:16:00,115
Well, we had people that didn't participate in our profiles.

301
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,697
And I thought, you know, why not?

302
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:02,978
It doesn't take that much time.

303
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,119
It's free publicity.

304
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,100
Why not?

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,902
It's not like we asked really hard questions.

306
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,344
No, I know.

307
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:11,327
And we're not out to get you.

308
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,429
We're giving you the chance to have your say.

309
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,752
And since we're not in print, we're not even limiting it.

310
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,695
You can go on as long as you want.

311
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:22,359
And Chris always asks that fun question, like, what book is on your nightstand?

312
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:22,639
I do.

313
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,900
I usually ask that to the school committee.

314
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,901
I don't know why, but yeah.

315
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:25,622
And it's fun.

316
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:26,724
I like to ask them.

317
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:27,805
You can make that up.

318
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,265
Same with us.

319
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,687
We weren't trying to trick anyone.

320
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,469
We weren't trying to ask tough questions.

321
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,074
I mean, if you watch the shows we did, they all got pretty similar questions.

322
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:37,235
I don't think there was anything.

323
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,857
I actually liked the candidates' nights this year.

324
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:48,822
I know some people didn't, but I love the way they did it, where they pulled them out of the fishbowl, and everybody got a different question, and you didn't have to listen to 14 people give the very same answer.

325
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,243
Yeah, I thought it was great.

326
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,964
It gets difficult.

327
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:55,406
And they had regular citizens send them questions.

328
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,707
Yeah, that was nice, too.

329
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,750
Usually you have a moderator, like somebody who asks all the questions, and nobody wants that.

330
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,070
Okay.

331
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,591
Well, I think we covered that pretty much.

332
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,673
We did a good job with that.

333
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:22,739
Um, so we're going to be moving on, uh, to the school committee, but before we do, uh, let's talk about the city council candidates and we have to, who did not get in.

334
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:29,302
And you, you basically answered this already, Chris, maybe you'll answer it the same way again.

335
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:29,902
Why?

336
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,393
didn't they get in?

337
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:33,193
Why?

338
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,856
I don't, I don't know, except that they were not a part of the machine.

339
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:44,461
I mean, it was very clear that the, you know, everybody but George was our revolution.

340
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,743
So I don't know if that was some

341
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:53,523
And like you said, I think the majority of the voters came out because our revolution brought them out.

342
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:58,944
They just didn't have the poll that the others did, because they were really good candidates.

343
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:03,005
And there were some candidates that I was surprised that didn't do as well as I thought that they would.

344
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:08,427
Not that I will have to say I am the worst at calling an election, so don't follow anything I will say.

345
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:09,547
If you look at the numbers, they're close.

346
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,067
The numbers are all pretty close.

347
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:11,808
They're all very close.

348
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:12,728
They all did well.

349
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,508
Yes, I thought they all did well, right.

350
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,549
And I'm going to tell you, it's not just the

351
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:21,890
The thing was, it's not just the city council, it's the school community.

352
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,710
It's the school community, too.

353
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,410
Absolutely.

354
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:23,690
It's 100%.

355
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,170
Yep.

356
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:24,550
Yep.

357
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:32,392
And... Yeah, I mean, you look at the difference between George and, uh, George Scarpelli and Liz Mullane, I mean, he... 87 votes.

358
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:32,692
Right.

359
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:34,012
I mean, he beat her.

360
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,212
I'm sorry, that... There are only 14.

361
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:35,732
14 votes.

362
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:36,972
Yeah.

363
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:43,314
And there's only 87 between Liz and, uh... Miranda, I think.

364
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:44,414
It's crazy.

365
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:45,214
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,704
It's a change, right?

367
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:47,812
It's a change.

368
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:53,025
Go back with me, okay, about 20 years, okay?

369
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,967
I'd love to go back to me.

370
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:59,670
Okay, and so Medford at one point was, let's call it old Medford, okay?

371
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,592
So you had a city council that had been there forever.

372
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,134
Old names, old families, okay, just really old.

373
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:16,762
And people would say, we need new voices, we need younger voices, we need people with different viewpoints who haven't been in Medford all their lives in 100 years worth of,

374
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,684
families and relatives, and now you have that.

375
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,524
So people are the same way, right?

376
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,785
So now we're all the way to the other side.

377
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:30,005
Now people are like, we need old Medford, we need older voices.

378
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:40,308
So you didn't get it this time, but you saw a lot of people come out and say, I live here and I want my voice because I'm not happy with what's happening.

379
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:44,329
So not only do you have like more people running, but you had a lot more voices.

380
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,249
So you had like the average citizen

381
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,521
up in arms about this is not happening in my neighborhood.

382
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:55,809
And you saw those people show up at meetings about zoning or whatever they were concerned about.

383
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,232
They came out.

384
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,076
If they had come out to vote, that would have probably been better.

385
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,198
Next time come out to vote.

386
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,321
Because then you can't complain.

387
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,482
Yeah, that's what we need.

388
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,703
We need them to come out and vote.

389
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:05,983
Right.

390
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:09,685
So it's just sort of, it's like a pendulum swing.

391
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,227
Eventually, eventually, it'll get back to the middle.

392
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:18,872
Because I remember when Zack Bares was first elected, he was like the youngest person on that council that had seen that council in years.

393
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:24,056
And now, you know, maybe the pendulum will swing back, maybe there'll be a middle and then they're like, who knows?

394
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:24,456
Yeah.

395
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,338
See, I always think back when you say go back 20 years.

396
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:39,772
You go back 20 years and I look at the council, you know, the Bob Mayako, Bob Penta, Paul Donato, Stephanie Burke, Michael Marks, those guys.

397
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:45,097
But you, the battles that went on.

398
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,837
But you enjoyed watching them.

399
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:49,879
Oh, yeah, and they got pretty intense.

400
00:20:50,080 --> 00:21:05,637
It was the best show in town People would watch the cable and they were like a popcorn just pop But see and I was you know, I obviously I was a lot younger than but when you watch that

401
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:11,639
The thing that I always took hold in me was, wow, look at these guys.

402
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,903
And these three think Medford's got to go this way.

403
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:21,248
And these three and this one, they all had different opinions.

404
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,850
And there was a lot of big issues back then.

405
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,851
You guys know that.

406
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,114
So to me, but it was always about Medford.

407
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,417
And there was always, it was just good to see the,

408
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,205
back and forth with these guys.

409
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:49,296
And you know, like I say, they'd be done, maybe they'd go out, have a drink, whatever, I don't know, but you know, they stayed, you know, they remained basically friendly.

410
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,718
The city stayed together.

411
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,840
I don't see that anymore.

412
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,121
I feel like.

413
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,823
That's national politics.

414
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,446
Yeah, right, and I feel like it's not,

415
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,439
You watch a city council.

416
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,202
I don't like the way they treat people anymore.

417
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:09,605
I mean, we always treated people with respect, dignity.

418
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:10,786
There was never any of that.

419
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,248
The councilors went back and forth.

420
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,671
They didn't go back and forth with the people too much.

421
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,652
The council usually just let them have their say.

422
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:18,093
Right.

423
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,135
And listened, but they paid attention.

424
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:24,199
Now I feel like only my opinion

425
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:32,641
You start with one council, they go right down the line, with the exception of George, and it's all the same conversation.

426
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,118
representing the whole city.

427
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:42,618
It's like you're ruling over this city.

428
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:43,079
A little bit.

429
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,519
That's the way I feel.

430
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:45,719
I mean, am I wrong?

431
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,320
No, it is a little bit that way, but that is what the people voted for.

432
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,720
Right.

433
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,261
No, no, I understand that's what they voted for.

434
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,802
But do they understand what they're voting for?

435
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,343
That's the question.

436
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:58,364
That's the question.

437
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:02,928
I think most the average, I mean, we can sit here because not, you know, you follow politics pretty close.

438
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,168
Right.

439
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:03,648
I do.

440
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,990
Yeah, I always do it as part of our job.

441
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:10,975
And we're more like on the inside watching, right, just kind of sometimes shaking your head.

442
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,657
But the average citizen is not watching that.

443
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,117
They are.

444
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,819
They're concerned with their taxes.

445
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,161
They're concerned with their, I mean, a lot of people

446
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,684
A lot of people said to us, I have no idea what's going on.

447
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,186
I have no idea that we're rezoning anything.

448
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,127
I don't know.

449
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,988
And this had been going on for two years.

450
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,930
It's been going on longer than that.

451
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,033
And by the end, we probably knew more about it than they did.

452
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,974
And we started this in February.

453
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:35,916
And we just started in February.

454
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,136
Right.

455
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:36,537
No, no.

456
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:37,317
I know.

457
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:37,878
Yeah.

458
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,219
I'll be completely honest.

459
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,600
I have no idea what's going on in my city.

460
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,441
There is an override.

461
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:41,901
I don't know.

462
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:43,322
I didn't pay attention.

463
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,186
Because I'm paying more attention to what's going on in Medford.

464
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:55,377
But you have to, at some point, as a resident or a citizen, take a step to participate.

465
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:58,201
You need to pay attention, whether the information is there or not.

466
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:02,366
I always hear, well, I'm working, I have this, I have that.

467
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,989
And I'm like, look, that's no excuse.

468
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,351
Yeah, you have to make it a priority.

469
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:10,496
It's like when I was younger, you used to get, it's your civic duty.

470
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:11,357
Now go vote.

471
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,058
And that was it.

472
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:13,459
You went and voted.

473
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,882
But that's the way I feel.

474
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:17,764
I just feel like it's not.

475
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:18,645
and

476
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:46,737
Yeah, hopefully, you know, I mean, I always believe, even if I disagree with people, you know, you give everybody a chance, we'll see what happens.

477
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:48,478
Maybe things will change this time.

478
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,340
You know, they'll listen, I don't, who knows, you know, maybe things will work out.

479
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,641
It's going to be interesting though, isn't it?

480
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:54,761
It is.

481
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:55,682
It's always interesting.

482
00:24:55,722 --> 00:25:03,966
Well, it's going to be interesting, and they've got, what, two years to prove it, because the charter comes, kicks in in the next election, and that's going to be a whole new ballgame.

483
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:06,767
Oh, that will be a completely new ballgame.

484
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,408
For everybody in the city.

485
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,870
It's kind of like going from plan E to plan A. Exactly.

486
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:16,232
With a whole new ballgame then, and now it's going to be completely changed.

487
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:17,773
It's going to be here before you know it.

488
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:18,073
I know.

489
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:22,355
All right, so we've got to just move on to the school committee.

490
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,818
You know, what do you think with the school committee?

491
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,780
What areas?

492
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:30,142
No opening.

493
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,723
No opening on the school committee.

494
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:32,024
Yeah.

495
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:32,464
Two new people.

496
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:33,025
Two new people.

497
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:33,305
Yeah.

498
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:33,865
Yeah.

499
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,987
That says something.

500
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:37,329
So maybe that's the change that we're looking at.

501
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:37,509
Yeah.

502
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,551
And Jessica Parks, I mean, she came in third.

503
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,772
She was third on the ticket.

504
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:41,133
Right.

505
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,354
So she didn't just like squeak in.

506
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,216
And Mike too.

507
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:44,556
Yeah.

508
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,218
Michael had a good showing as well.

509
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:46,858
He came in fifth.

510
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,301
So, yeah, we do have some new people on there.

511
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:50,481
Yeah.

512
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,262
And I think they're going to be great.

513
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:56,185
I mean, Michael is the budget director for the city of Somerville.

514
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:56,445
Right.

515
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:00,228
So he's got certainly going to help the school committee.

516
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:00,568
Yeah.

517
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:07,533
And Jessica is she's a project manager in campus construction for MIT.

518
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,294
So, you know, when you come into the high school project, you got two ringers.

519
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:12,855
And maintenance.

520
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:13,415
Right there.

521
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,135
And maintenance.

522
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:19,237
It's going to be a lot when it comes to that, to the high school.

523
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,857
Yeah, they're going to have their work cut out for them.

524
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:21,698
That will be fun.

525
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:22,358
That will be fun.

526
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:22,938
That will be fun.

527
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,399
But I think they're going to be great additions to the school committee.

528
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,119
I mean, not that Nicole and John weren't.

529
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,780
Nicole and John were great.

530
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
No, I think they did a great job.

531
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,380
Again.

532
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,000
They really did.

533
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,302
I think they had really good candidates.

534
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:36,563
I think anybody, you know, that they had voted would have been fine, would have been great.

535
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:39,385
Yeah, exactly.

536
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,569
But it'll be nice to see new blood.

537
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:42,989
It's always fun.

538
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:43,590
New blood, yeah.

539
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,877
So we might have something positive to look at with the school committee.

540
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,358
Oh, they got their work cut out for them.

541
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:51,699
They do.

542
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,981
We know that with everything that's going on.

543
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,062
Yeah, they got a lot going on.

544
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:55,663
Yeah, it'll be interesting.

545
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,165
They got a new superintendent coming in.

546
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,067
They're going to think about that in June.

547
00:26:59,307 --> 00:26:59,567
Yeah.

548
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:00,668
Oh, yeah.

549
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:01,988
The hiring a new superintendent.

550
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:02,228
Yeah.

551
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,269
My vote is for Suzanne.

552
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,749
Lucy, she's doing an amazing job.

553
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,470
I want a good job.

554
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,270
Oh, I think she's she's a Medford girl.

555
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,091
Yeah, I know.

556
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:09,571
Yeah, she is right.

557
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,312
Her entire career has been her entire career.

558
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:11,692
Yeah.

559
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:12,793
Her family's from here.

560
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,253
Her dad was Jack Buckley.

561
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:15,594
I hope they do that.

562
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,074
But nice.

563
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:16,994
Yeah, I remember.

564
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:18,175
School committee guy.

565
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:18,675
Yeah.

566
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:18,955
Yeah.

567
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:19,055
Yeah.

568
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:19,575
Would be great.

569
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:20,436
I think she's awesome.

570
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:24,697
But I imagine they will have to go out for a search just to because they have to because they have to.

571
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:24,918
Yeah.

572
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,788
I got to finish up with the charter.

573
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:30,568
Okay.

574
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:31,349
I mean.

575
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,389
Let's do it.

576
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,650
We love the charter.

577
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,471
I got to tell you.

578
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,873
I voted.

579
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:38,433
I did.

580
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:39,314
I voted yes.

581
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:40,134
I like it too.

582
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:41,175
I really do.

583
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:42,015
I think it's great.

584
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:43,756
You have to make a change.

585
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,038
But I got to be honest.

586
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:47,139
Yeah, I agree with you.

587
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:50,741
But I was like, wow, did they vote for the charter.

588
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:51,061
Yeah.

589
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:57,165
People have been wanting a new charter since, oh my gosh, I can't.

590
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:58,509
Yeah, forever.

591
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,270
I mean, forever.

592
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,934
Berk came in and there was a committee that they wanted to do a charter.

593
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:05,275
They wanted a grassroots committee.

594
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,677
They wanted the city council to get on board.

595
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:12,521
But that old council was like, we're not going to go to wards because we'll have to fight each other.

596
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:13,481
They were not on board.

597
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,363
There was a lot of attempts made.

598
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,264
And this one finally went through.

599
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:20,046
And so people can see, there was a change.

600
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,867
We're going to go with this change.

601
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:24,448
And we can always change the charter again.

602
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,369
Yes, it's not set in stone.

603
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,530
That's what I like about it.

604
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,332
It's like a living, I think Ron said it best, Melva.

605
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,012
It is.

606
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,033
It's a living document.

607
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:35,175
Well, there's a charter review built in, I think, for every five years, right?

608
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:35,675
Yes, that's right.

609
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,256
It's perfect.

610
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,977
I mean, it did pass by almost 5,000 votes.

611
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:38,277
It's huge.

612
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:38,717
It's huge.

613
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,260
I agree with a lot of it.

614
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,661
There's some things I don't agree with.

615
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,183
Yeah, the school committee setup is a little weird.

616
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:51,287
Yeah, I didn't understand that, but I mean, I think the mayor, four years?

617
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:52,308
Perfect.

618
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:53,449
It should be.

619
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,409
Really, don't you?

620
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,272
Other cities and towns have done it, and it's worked out.

621
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,235
Because otherwise you're constantly running for re-election.

622
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,198
You barely get a year in.

623
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,841
You barely get anything done and then you're running for re-election again.

624
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:06,822
It's ridiculous.

625
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:07,824
Unless you're there forever.

626
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,886
Like McGlynn was there for 30 years.

627
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,608
So he was like whatever.

628
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:15,132
Everybody who ran against him he like flattened.

629
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:15,673
Yeah.

630
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,377
And so there wasn't any opportunity.

631
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,679
So he could get stuff done.

632
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,406
But you know, the last two mayors, it's hard to get stuff done in two years.

633
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:25,688
I agree with you.

634
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:26,369
Yeah.

635
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,171
So that's great.

636
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:28,032
That's a great change.

637
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,034
I think it's...

638
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:42,699
You know, hopefully you get good mayors, you know, but four years, I definitely think they need at least that amount of time to make, you know, to get some things done, accomplished, however you want it.

639
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:52,302
You're not worrying about, like Chris said, you're not worrying about that every, oh my gosh, here I go again, am I going to see this project continued, is my successor, if there ever will be one.

640
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:55,543
Are they going to continue the project?

641
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:56,483
The project's in the works.

642
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,364
You're never going to get anything done, like you said.

643
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:05,506
But I don't really care about the school changes, I'll be completely honest, but I love the city council changes.

644
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,407
Yeah, that makes total sense.

645
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,048
I mean, I can't believe they don't have ward counselors now.

646
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:12,049
I mean, that's... I love that.

647
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:14,630
Yeah, I've never covered a community that doesn't have ward counselors.

648
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,991
I live in a warded community, and I love it.

649
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:20,032
And I'll tell you why I love it, because I can call, I can pick up the phone,

650
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,408
I can call up my city, I know who it is.

651
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,969
You know who it is, you probably have their number right next to the fridge.

652
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:25,969
Yeah, it's crazy.

653
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,490
You can complain about stuff.

654
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,411
And it makes it more easy for people to be involved because it's one of your neighbors.

655
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,872
You might see them walk by your house, the park, whatever.

656
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:44,374
And what I love about it too is in the city I live in, in Malden, my city councilor, my ward councilor holds a little thing every year.

657
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,455
On the 4th of, they do, I love it.

658
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:54,058
On the 4th of July for families in the ward on one of the parks, they bring out stuff, but you get an opportunity to meet the people in your ward.

659
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,959
You know your neighbors.

660
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:57,779
You know who this person is.

661
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,242
And so it's, I think, you know, people want to be represented in wards.

662
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:10,545
They want people to, people in North Medford don't care that other people are like, they're like, why is this person who doesn't know what my problems are?

663
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,166
Doing this person all the way across town, right?

664
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,487
Yeah, people in South Medford have different problems and right.

665
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:22,790
Oh, absolutely or West No, wherever we have our own little areas and I yeah, I think it's great.

666
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:34,354
I love that have that yeah, it's about time Chris is weirded out by the Well the school committee this so is that I mean am I reading that correctly one?

667
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:35,415
They're gonna one.

668
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,155
I don't understand.

669
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,036
They're gonna be elected by districts.

670
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:39,016
So there's four districts.

671
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:39,837
Yeah, that's

672
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:41,438
just weird to me.

673
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:44,420
I've never seen another community that does that.

674
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,302
Not a school community.

675
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:50,105
You represent, because you don't just represent your district.

676
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,987
You have to represent all the schools equally.

677
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,849
Yeah, the schools are all over the city, so I agree.

678
00:31:56,109 --> 00:32:02,414
Isn't there a city council thing where they want, like every school, again, every school is different in every district of the city.

679
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:04,876
But you're right, it has to be, you can't be.

680
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:05,816
But it has to be equal.

681
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:08,397
Yeah, I think you have to represent every school.

682
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:13,359
I mean, that's always been an argument in every community I've ever covered is equal funding for schools.

683
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,843
And maybe they feel that having districts that this way they'll be able to do that because they'll have somebody fighting for a specific district.

684
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:21,643
I don't know.

685
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:26,225
Or maybe you're like four districts, I've got to spread the money across the four districts instead of.

686
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:28,972
figuring that maybe more money will go here.

687
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,259
Is that the thinking?

688
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,242
I don't know.

689
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,084
I don't know what it is.

690
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,356
was tough for me to figure out.

691
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,057
I'm not sure.

692
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:40,178
I mean, there may be a good reason for it.

693
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:41,639
I'm sure they had a reason.

694
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,901
But I can honestly tell you I haven't heard one yet.

695
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,663
What do you think of the mayor being knocked off as the chairman?

696
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:49,044
That also surprised me.

697
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,705
I was like, wow.

698
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,586
Again, I've never covered a community.

699
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,588
I've never covered a city where the mayor wasn't the automata.

700
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:58,610
I think that's part of some deal they might have worked out or something.

701
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,311
It had to be.

702
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,072
I was very surprised.

703
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,053
I just said that was interesting.

704
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,435
Mean that's the biggest budget.

705
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:05,156
It's the biggest.

706
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:16,468
Yeah She's still a voting member Yeah, yeah, but it was you know, she she was in charge put it that way and that's you know You're talking a lot of money.

707
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:23,156
It is a huge amount of money people might say well, you know now you have a president a vice president they're able to go to the schools, but

708
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,019
They've always been at the schools.

709
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,781
Jenny Graham is great.

710
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,565
She goes out there and has a vice chair.

711
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:30,707
She's out everywhere.

712
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:33,631
And the mayor goes to a ton of school stuff too.

713
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:35,895
It's not like Medford doesn't have

714
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,741
Representation in the schools schools are a very important and big thing.

715
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:43,522
Yeah the city.

716
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:47,464
Yeah, and have been for a long time So that's a that's a weird one.

717
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,786
Yeah, and their numbers don't change just their configuration changes.

718
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:57,510
It's weird Yeah, so the last question I have to get this thing because you mentioned the mayor so we know the mayor

719
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,052
ran unchallenged this election.

720
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:02,294
What do you think?

721
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:09,822
Do you think the mayor's reelection will have any impact, the important decision-making coming, the public?

722
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,527
You know, I mean... She has no reason to change.

723
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:15,128
Right.

724
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:15,828
Well, I mean...

725
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:18,403
She's got the city council still the same.

726
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:22,344
Right, but you were talking earlier about- Although there's a little friction between them.

727
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,144
Yes.

728
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:23,585
Yeah.

729
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,225
That's good to see.

730
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:25,985
I think so.

731
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:26,546
I think it has to be.

732
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,186
People say, why is that good to see?

733
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:32,488
Because that means- Like you said, because then there's some debate on issues.

734
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:33,488
There's debate.

735
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,689
It's not just a rubber stamp.

736
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:37,310
You rubber stamp her ideas, or she rubber stamps their ideas.

737
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,931
I guess I'm trying to think.

738
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,992
You had said it earlier, and I know other people,

739
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:54,014
have said this, you know, with the mayor, with, I mean, I know they do their messaging and everything else, but do you think because she ran unelected, it's better for you?

740
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:54,915
You think you'll get?

741
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:55,635
No.

742
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:56,015
No.

743
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:57,035
You think it's going to be?

744
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:57,255
No.

745
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:58,335
She has no reason.

746
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:59,876
Like I said, she has no reason.

747
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:03,096
There was no, there was no call to action for her.

748
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:04,577
There was no, there was no threat.

749
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,997
There was no, it wasn't a close race.

750
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,077
So, you know, maybe I better change my ways.

751
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:08,738
But there were 1,000 write-ins?

752
00:35:10,598 --> 00:35:12,459
Yeah, which is a lot.

753
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:14,699
Yeah, no, I heard about that, yeah.

754
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,360
And I heard there was quite a few rumors.

755
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah, I think that was very interesting, was it?

756
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,481
But I don't know.

757
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:26,263
For some reason, I just think that she's gonna... City Hall is locked down like Fort Knox.

758
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:26,903
Open up a little now.

759
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:26,963
No.

760
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,043
Yeah, you don't think so?

761
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,484
You think she's gonna relax, maybe?

762
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,844
I mean, how long has she been doing the job now?

763
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,553
2020, she was elected in 2019.

764
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,413
She took over in 2020.

765
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:41,114
She was two months in before COVID hit.

766
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,795
Right, and that was tough.

767
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:43,815
Let's be honest.

768
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:44,615
That was horrible.

769
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,475
Yeah, it's tough.

770
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:46,735
She did a great job with that.

771
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:47,776
Yeah, it was tough.

772
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:50,916
Because everybody followed Kurt Atone in Somerville.

773
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:51,857
This guy did stuff.

774
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,037
Everybody was like, well, that looks like a good idea.

775
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,417
And they went with him.

776
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:56,498
And that's hard.

777
00:35:56,598 --> 00:36:00,779
So that was her first challenge was the pandemic and getting the city back to normal.

778
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,019
And she did a great job of that.

779
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,881
And she's got stuff that's happening.

780
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,242
And we're not out together.

781
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:07,803
We're just asking questions.

782
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:10,424
That's the part that people don't understand.

783
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:16,148
It's sort of like, if anything, people want to help you and on and on and on.

784
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:16,949
We want specifics.

785
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,510
We want to talk to the people who know the specifics.

786
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,453
We don't need to be monitored like we're five-year-olds asking questions.

787
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,114
I've been doing this job for 30 years.

788
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,355
Trust that I have a little integrity.

789
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,056
But if she doesn't have someone,

790
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:31,118
that ran against her.

791
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,880
I mean, you know, that's to me.

792
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,180
Why?

793
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,201
Why did nobody run against?

794
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:35,621
I don't know.

795
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:39,605
But I'd be if I'm the mayor and no one's running against me, I'm going to be more relaxed.

796
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,126
I might open up a little bit.

797
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,368
No, you would hope I might because what am I worried about?

798
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,569
No one ran against me.

799
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:48,211
That's, you know, just because you're worried about two years.

800
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,532
Yeah, that's what you're worried about.

801
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:49,953
Two years.

802
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,214
when the charter kicks in.

803
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:57,279
Don't forget, the charter kicks in, right, and we're not going for every two years, we're going for every four years.

804
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:58,580
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,286
So now you got a man that's sitting there for four years, and if you don't like them, you're like, well, in two years, no, no, that's a four-year position, like the president.

806
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:15,574
Like it's gonna be, like the president, there every four years, and then what?

807
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,015
Do I think she's confident?

808
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:18,925
I would be.

809
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,291
Yeah.

810
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:20,794
She should be.

811
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,301
But do I think she's going to give an inch?

812
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:23,518
No.

813
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:24,539
No, you don't think so, huh?

814
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,399
I don't think so.

815
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,720
Maybe for some reason.

816
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,480
Surprise us.

817
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,820
I don't know what it is.

818
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,102
I sometimes go with my gut feeling.

819
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:35,483
I go into City Hall sometimes just to walk around and say hello to people.

820
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:36,844
It's like I've got bubonic plague.

821
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,024
No, you can't do that anymore.

822
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:38,864
Don't talk to her.

823
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:41,145
Here comes the news report.

824
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,546
I seriously just want to say hi.

825
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:43,106
How are the kids?

826
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:45,527
Hi, how are you?

827
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,348
Can I have some of your candy?

828
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,129
That's usually what I'm looking for.

829
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:56,834
But I think the mayor needs to open up and just, like you said, give a little.

830
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:57,514
Yeah.

831
00:37:57,594 --> 00:38:00,516
I mean, with all due respect, City Hall is supposed to be the house of the people.

832
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:01,317
It's supposed to be open.

833
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,858
It's supposed to be open to the public.

834
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:04,679
And that's the way it should be.

835
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,360
Get information.

836
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,320
That is the way it should be.

837
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,002
That's supposed to be information central.

838
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:08,262
Yeah.

839
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:09,002
Yeah.

840
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:10,663
It's a very odd.

841
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:11,783
It's very odd.

842
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:18,386
They like to, in my opinion, they sort of, not that they sort of, they love to control information.

843
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:18,886
Oh yes.

844
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,186
And that's all of them.

845
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:24,768
But I think the doors, the doors are really locked with Mayor Burke's election.

846
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:26,288
Stephanie Burke's election.

847
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:32,029
She came down and said, I'm going to hire a PR person or a person to deal with my communications.

848
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,570
I'm going to lock it down.

849
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:40,771
And you as the news, because I sat with her, and was told, from now on, you have to ask my permission to speak to people.

850
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:41,811
Oh, it's like the Pentagon.

851
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,432
And I said to her, and I remember saying to her, I'm not going to ask you permission at all.

852
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:51,133
I'm going to call the person, and then they're going to call you for permission, because they're your employees and you're not.

853
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,014
but it's gotten worse.

854
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:57,617
That has gotten worse with Brianna.

855
00:38:57,697 --> 00:39:04,062
She just doesn't, I mean she's got people, you call them, you ask them a question, and then they never get back to you.

856
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,604
And what is she afraid of?

857
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:06,804
I don't know.

858
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,025
I can't answer that.

859
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:08,806
I really can't.

860
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,507
I don't get it.

861
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:10,548
Claire, what are you afraid of?

862
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:11,629
Chris wants to know.

863
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,490
I would like to know.

864
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,933
We'll see what happens.

865
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:15,814
I don't know.

866
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,637
I just have a better gut feeling this time.

867
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,418
Well, I hope you're right.

868
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:19,259
I hope you're right.

869
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,241
And like I say, we'll find out.

870
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:25,684
I'd like to see the city council be a little bit more open.

871
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:27,064
I would love to see that.

872
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:30,325
I'd love to have you be able to call them like you, I think we used to in the old days.

873
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,305
And they answered the phone.

874
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,125
Answer the phone.

875
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:33,586
Or your email.

876
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:37,166
Not have to like set a time to maybe I'll get back to you in three weeks.

877
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:40,587
We're going to be watching everything in two thousand days.

878
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:45,789
The only person, I wouldn't say the only person, the only two people have gotten back to me with Zach Behrs.

879
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,769
I text him and he gets back to me.

880
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,850
And the one who's leaving, whose name I can't remember right now.

881
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,370
Kit Collins.

882
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,071
I'm sorry, Kit.

883
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:53,931
I apologize.

884
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,212
She's been fantastic.

885
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:59,214
I text her, and she texts me back and tries to answer my questions the best I can.

886
00:39:59,234 --> 00:39:59,934
I mean, it's nice.

887
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,616
Even if you don't agree with them, at least if they respond.

888
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:03,917
Yeah.

889
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:04,577
Yeah, that's all.

890
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:05,437
Just respond.

891
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,118
I don't have to agree.

892
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,939
Just respond with a no comment.

893
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,459
Whatever.

894
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,019
Just respond.

895
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,440
Something.

896
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,780
Yeah.

897
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,400
No, I know.

898
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,700
I know.

899
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,701
Don't just blow it all up.

900
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:12,361
Just tell me no.

901
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:13,021
I mean, no is fine.

902
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,102
Because we're not going away.

903
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:14,162
No.

904
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:16,583
Well, we'll see what happens.

905
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:17,844
Chris is very pessimistic.

906
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:19,325
She wants to be.

907
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:23,649
It's a fine line between persistence and stalking.

908
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,631
We'll be on the show.

909
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:27,073
You guys will be coming back.

910
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,975
We'll do a few more shows.

911
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,096
We'll do everything.

912
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:32,459
I mean, we'll keep the whole city.

913
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,682
I can't wait for inauguration day.

914
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:36,363
There you go.

915
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:38,643
And there's a lot of arts things going on.

916
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:40,424
The city is very busy right now.

917
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,865
Yeah, there's a ton of stuff.

918
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:47,226
And without everybody obsessing over politics right now, it'll be great.

919
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,566
We've got the holidays coming up.

920
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:53,187
I think we all need a break, us and the city.

921
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:58,488
I just want to give one more plug for people to go to the November 18th, 4 to 7.

922
00:40:58,808 --> 00:40:59,729
Come to City Hall.

923
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,449
Come talk to the planning people.

924
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,169
Tell them your ideas.

925
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,650
There will be people directly

926
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:05,811
Okay.

927
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:06,832
That you can speak to.

928
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:07,453
Sounds good.

929
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:08,935
I can talk to you ladies.

930
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:12,159
As you know, we could go on all night, but I can't.

931
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,340
You know?

932
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,203
We'll go for a drink after that.

933
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:15,944
Yeah.

934
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:17,225
To the old Tiki Island.

935
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:18,147
Yeah, there you go.

936
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,128
It's good now.

937
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:21,631
Wow, is it good.

938
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:22,312
Love it in there.

939
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:22,913
A whole wind.

940
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,634
We gotta have him on the show.

941
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:25,474
That's what we gotta do.

942
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,696
We gotta have some restaurants come on.

943
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,957
We got a lot of stuff.

944
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:31,318
Chris actually does restaurant reviews.

945
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:31,959
He do.

946
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,440
I was a food reporter.

947
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,161
I did a column for 14 years.

948
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:36,742
So we'll be in touch.

949
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:37,542
Definitely.

950
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:40,324
So I gotta thank you both.

951
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:41,506
Oh, it's our pleasure.

952
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,026
Our pleasure.

953
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,227
I really enjoyed it.

954
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,189
We always love to come to see you and Paul and the gang.

955
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,673
As usual, whenever I have you guys, we always go over time.

956
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:51,855
We always start, you know, we gotta move on.

957
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,057
So much to talk about.

958
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:53,797
Yeah, there is.

959
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:55,118
Well, it's fun.

960
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,200
It's like a nice conversation.

961
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,704
And the city election has been on everybody's mind for months and months and months.

962
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:02,866
So now they can get down to work.

963
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,711
We get to take a break, but they have to get to work.

964
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:09,413
No they don't, they have to get to work in January.

965
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:12,775
That's the fun time of the year coming up, that's all.

966
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,337
But thank you both of you, I appreciate it.

967
00:42:16,658 --> 00:42:23,762
So, you know, I've got to thank my guests again, Nell Escobar-Copley, and of course Chris Stevens.

968
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:31,908
from the Gotta Know Method team, sharing their thoughts on the 2025 Method election.

969
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:34,310
I hope everyone enjoyed the show.

970
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:39,674
I also want to take a minute to thank everyone who has been watching the show.

971
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:42,076
I want to thank you for your feedback.

972
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:47,401
I always say whether it's positive, negative, it's been all positive.

973
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:49,622
We're happy with that.

974
00:42:50,483 --> 00:43:15,213

Thank you.

Ta-da!
