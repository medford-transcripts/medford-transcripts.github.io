00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:30,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everyone and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the City of Medford.

2
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:58,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not one but two very special guests, Nell Escobar-Cokley and Chris Stevens, the founders of Guttano-Metford.

5
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:11,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will be sharing their thoughts on the results of the recent elections for the Method City Council, school committee, and also we'll discuss the revised city charter.

6
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:19,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I also want to mention that Wendell Waters was supposed to join us today.

7
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:23,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to miss her, but she couldn't join us.

8
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:30,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, she's also with Guttenroh Medford.

9
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, we'll start right off.

10
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,089
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll begin by looking at the candidates who won.

11
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, why do you think they were successful?

12
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,334
[SPEAKER_03]: get the, how did they win, what did they do?

13
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:48,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can't fault the machine.

14
00:01:49,136 --> 00:02:03,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our Revolution Medford is, all of them are our Revolution Medford winners, with the exception of George Scarpelli, which they sort of noted on their website when they said that we won 12 out of 13 seats.

15
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only assume the seat they did not win was George's.

17
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:11,688
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, I think, like I said, I mean, they're a machine.

18
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:13,449
[SPEAKER_02]: They were prepared.

19
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,191
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew what they were going to do.

20
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,474
[SPEAKER_02]: They worked as a team, as a block, and they pulled that off.

21
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:25,522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, were you surprised at all by how good some of the candidates finished?

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought they did extremely well.

23
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was a really good supply of candidates this time around.

24
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:36,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a lot of really good people.

25
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,375
[SPEAKER_02]: They had really great ideas.

26
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really well informed.

27
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,156
[SPEAKER_02]: They all worked really hard.

28
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed up for events.

29
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,058
[SPEAKER_02]: They answered questions.

30
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: they went out and hit the pavement.

31
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't think Medford was at a loss for, you know, any good candidate.

32
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:53,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just talking about the incumbents, I'm talking about the- No, the challengers were great.

33
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:56,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The independent slate, there were a lot of really good people.

34
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:57,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

35
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,292
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot to choose from.

36
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I felt, yeah.

37
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:08,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought they did well, and I mean, I was surprised by the results.

38
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:08,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you guys-

39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:09,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

40
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I was surprised.

41
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once you get in, you're an incumbent.

42
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's, it's, it's, you know, they hang out of those seats sometimes.

43
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it can sometimes be difficult to balance them.

44
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,834
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, from our standpoint, it's always a little disappointing.

45
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:26,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see new people come in there.

46
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:28,857
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see somebody come in and shake things up.

47
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:29,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

48
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:34,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, oh, yeah, we got, you know, but but Liz is in and that's great.

49
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:34,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Or

50
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Miranda, I don't know.

51
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:44,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's close right now and historically in Medford You have people who have been in those seats once like it's hard to shake out an incumbent, right?

52
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:53,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when you shake out an incumbent is when someone leaves retires they leave they go do something else and that's usually when you've seen those big changes so without

53
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:59,318
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with an empty seat, I thought for sure we would see at least two more new people.

54
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were so many.

55
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:03,179
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many people.

56
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,820
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 17 to begin with for City Council.

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, oh, good Lord, as a reporter, that is like impossible to cover, to write about, to keep track of.

58
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, and I was like, OK, so they're going to have a

59
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not a primary, a preliminary vote.

60
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,364
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that'll knock it down great.

61
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it only knocked it down by three, which is, I get that's their city cap, but still, from our standpoint, it's like, oh my God, there's 14 candidates to write about.

62
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be more in the next election.

63
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:29,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes.

64
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the charter, we will have four more people.

65
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:32,928
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

66
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't even think of that.

67
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, I would think, is going to be a free-for-all.

68
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,592
[SPEAKER_01]: people coming out to run for that.

69
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be exciting.

70
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:46,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's gonna be even more interesting because you're gonna have them in wards.

71
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:51,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna have eight wards and three people who are at large.

72
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're gonna have pockets of the city where you're gonna have those mini battles.

73
00:04:56,965 --> 00:05:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have three or four people running from the eighth precinct or the first precinct.

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's gonna be really tricky to see but it'll be like really fun and exciting because we've never done that before.

75
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:15,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an off-the-cuff question that I don't know because I'm still familiarizing myself with the city and with the wards and precincts.

76
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:20,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So of the incumbents now, do they cross over in wards?

77
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,776
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question, John, do they?

78
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe some of them do.

79
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,319
[SPEAKER_03]: At least three of them.

80
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,140
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be really interesting.

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe four.

82
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe four will cross over.

83
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes it difficult.

84
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:32,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

85
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:37,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why the old city councils, at some point, that's why they didn't want to switch to each other.

86
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they were like, we're in the same ward.

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to fight each other.

88
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be really interesting.

89
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:44,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think a few of them are.

90
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting.

91
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe they'll move.

92
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:52,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think any of them actually own homes, so they're not tied down to that space.

93
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,996
[SPEAKER_03]: They could, absolutely.

94
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think maybe two of them do.

95
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:07,919
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, let's take a look, you know, if you guys can, the support, where their support came from.

96
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you notice any strong

97
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:24,297
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, strong areas of Medford that voted for the independents, we'll call them, or strong areas that went for our revolution.

98
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,917
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been studying.

99
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,318
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, but I don't know all the wards and whatnot.

100
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting, I know, like you very kindly printed out a map.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

102
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:42,283
[SPEAKER_01]: That it does seem to be like this section with 3-2, Ward 3, Ward 2, what is down here, 4.

103
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,264
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have the highest turnout.

104
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,105
[SPEAKER_01]: There seemed to be a lot of, that was a very heavy turnout.

105
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:48,405
[SPEAKER_01]: West Bedford?

106
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:54,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the West Bedford Fire Station, they did Our Revolution.

107
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,107
[SPEAKER_03]: did very well.

108
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,529
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of younger families that moved into that area.

109
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole different neighborhood over there.

110
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes complete sense.

111
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:09,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the temple is in West Bedford, the independents actually did very good.

112
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:10,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

113
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did better.

114
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:12,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did good.

115
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:13,015
[SPEAKER_03]: They really did.

116
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they were out there too.

117
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they were out quite a bit.

118
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:21,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to drive around some of the polling locations on Tuesday, and that's what I saw.

119
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:32,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of people out with signs and then got yelled at because, you know, we took pictures or I took pictures of, you know, the people who were out standing with signs, and they were, quote, unquote, the independent slate.

120
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,771
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a ton of people out.

121
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:39,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see anybody at all at the fire station, but there was a line out the door.

122
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a line out the door there.

123
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.

124
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And the polling areas were all busy.

125
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to a lot of the wardens and they were like, it has been like steady, steady all day long.

126
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what was the percentage?

127
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:55,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the turnout wasn't... Oh, no.

128
00:07:57,383 --> 00:08:04,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the total voters, the total turnout, I have the numbers, 14,175 was your total.

129
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Total vote.

130
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, total people that voted, not the numbers.

131
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was your total number of people.

132
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And this always bothers me.

133
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It always will.

134
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't forgive people.

135
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, 14,000 is a lot of people.

136
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a civic duty to vote.

137
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,783
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a lot for Medford.

138
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:24,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

139
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:24,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

140
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,665
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Medford's history of voting, this is a lot.

141
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:28,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it is.

142
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:29,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the block.

143
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:33,168
[SPEAKER_02]: The block came out with at least 7,000 votes for themselves.

144
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:39,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And compared to the number of registered voters or people of voting age that live here, it's not a lot.

145
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it isn't, because you have 44,000 registered voters.

146
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

147
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had 14,000 people came out.

148
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:48,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a lot of homeowners.

149
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Our revolution basically run

150
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,704
[SPEAKER_03]: won with 7,000 votes.

151
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a solid block of people who will come out.

152
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people say, well, we've never seen that.

153
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:01,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen that.

154
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have.

155
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:08,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had Mike McGlynn, who always used to pull out at least 5,000 votes for himself.

156
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had that in the past.

157
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:10,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had those blocks.

158
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've had what people would refer to as the machine.

159
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Chris said, they have a machine.

160
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,854
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it down pat.

161
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be tough.

162
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unless one of them leaves.

163
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, honestly, they're a national organization.

164
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:24,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.

165
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know where the money comes from.

166
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all got how many mailers from them?

167
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's incredible.

168
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:33,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they spend money.

169
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just Medford.

170
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:36,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I live in Malden.

171
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden's like that now.

172
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard for it's hard for people to get in.

173
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,160
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting a lot of money.

174
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It's national money, that's what it is.

175
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it coming from?

176
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:47,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

177
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it coming from?

178
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That I don't have any answer.

179
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:50,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will find out.

180
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:51,904
[SPEAKER_02]: We will find out.

181
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

182
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,687
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is, you know, you say once you get in there, it's tough sometimes to get incumbents out.

183
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys are all young.

184
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:00,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

185
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:05,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, unless they get bored with the gig, they could potentially be in there for a very long time.

186
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,012
[SPEAKER_00]: For quite a while.

187
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and some of them might have bigger ambitions.

188
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, right?

189
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they do.

190
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Bears, are you running for mayor?

191
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's going to be more up the road.

192
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:18,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

193
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,278
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's move on a little bit here now.

194
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:34,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So your thoughts, and what I'm looking for here, you know, your thoughts, the results of the city council, you know,

195
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:47,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward for the city of Medford, you know, we're talking, let's talk budget, zoning, economic development.

196
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they control the whole council.

197
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:53,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

198
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they going with these, with the zoning, with the?

199
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,104
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

200
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,224
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion?

201
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:08,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to see where the rezoning is going to go because the mayor put the kibosh on that when she declined to further fund their consultant.

202
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of put the brakes on the six-year journey.

203
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume that city council and the mayor are going to have to come

204
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,296
[SPEAKER_01]: to some sort of agreement at some point.

205
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:22,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or it's just going to be dead in the water.

206
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine it's going to be dead in the water after all these years.

207
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They had an idea that they worked on for two years.

208
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to rezone the entire city at the same time in two years.

209
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's crazy.

210
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there are cities that take forever.

211
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,365
[SPEAKER_02]: They take it one section at a time.

212
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why you saw so many independent candidates.

213
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people were very upset about it.

214
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:52,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it all seemed to sort of trickle to an end, and then the mayor said, we're not doing this, because she was probably getting complaints, and nobody knew what was going on.

215
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And people weren't getting information.

216
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting information.

217
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:57,999
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked millions of questions.

218
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been turned down.

219
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,641
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for sit-downs.

220
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for meetings.

221
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for all kinds of things.

222
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't just imagine what that's like for the regular citizen who wants to ask a question and doesn't get it answered.

223
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:14,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, personally, the mayor was waiting to see where the election went, what shook out.

224
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

225
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,946
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hasn't changed.

226
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:17,707
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

227
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's changed.

228
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,810
[SPEAKER_02]: They will come to some sort of agreement.

229
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there are enough people that are saying, let's just take this a little bit slower.

230
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's back the truck up and just take it a little slower.

231
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Zach said that.

232
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Zach?

233
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,079
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a seven.

234
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:38,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's what I, and this is only my opinion,

235
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:46,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that now that the election's over, I mean, I'm just talking zoning.

236
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:47,580
[SPEAKER_03]: The election's over.

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the election, I think they realized that, wow, the pushback they got on the zoning.

238
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:07,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they realized that, the pushback they were getting, so they slowed down the zoning and everything.

239
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:15,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that they're elected and they're back in office, I hate to see it.

240
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to go full steam.

241
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But she has to give them money.

242
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I understand all that.

243
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm getting at.

244
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,092
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, boom, boom, boom, and it's going to happen.

245
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:33,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the mayor may end up, I don't know what the word is, going to battle with them.

246
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:33,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

247
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the plan.

248
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their planning board, right?

249
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And that board, by the way, November 18.

250
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

251
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having yes, yeah, they open house and open house.

252
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:46,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which you know, if you're concerned about zoning, my thing is go go go to that.

253
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:47,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from

254
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: 47.

255
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Chris just told me this today.

256
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: She made me say I'm going.

257
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Told us she had to go.

258
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,981
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going, right?

259
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:01,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And we encourage people to go and to ask those questions and to say to the mayor, I want you to take this slow.

260
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked that board for a sit down and we got a lot of like nothing, silent.

261
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,251
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to have to answer these questions.

262
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,832
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to answer the questions.

263
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you guys get silence.

264
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the city gets silence.

265
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have to ask this.

266
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:22,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

267
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem?

268
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why can't they just come out?

269
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, either way.

270
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,280
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not used to having a newspaper.

271
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not used to having to answer to anything.

272
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,844
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't think they have to answer to anybody.

273
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,366
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're here now.

274
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:43,011
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we didn't come in early enough in this election to probably have any kind of an impact.

275
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next time that there is an election, we are here.

276
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might want to take that into account.

277
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,099
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interesting.

278
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:50,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to say.

279
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,446
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interesting because we can report on the fact that nobody's getting any information about anything.

280
00:14:55,486 --> 00:15:01,594
[SPEAKER_02]: They did actually, they were very good about returning candidate questionnaires that we did send out.

281
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to put that together.

282
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:07,578
[SPEAKER_01]: The council is pretty good about getting back to us.

283
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always timely, but they do get back to us.

284
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,700
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor's office does not really answer much of anything.

285
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,960
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to issue press releases, but they don't.

286
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,241
[SPEAKER_01]: They issue a lot of press releases.

287
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:19,461
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.

288
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:27,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the answer going forward for us is on our stories that we'll be saying we reached out to so and so at this office and they did not return calls.

289
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,543
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my favorite thing to write.

290
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,203
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I hear you.

291
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,304
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked everybody.

292
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,345
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, we did a lot of political shows.

293
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:35,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You did, yeah.

294
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:36,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

295
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sort of, you know, we're going to... Step away from that.

296
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Get away from the politics now.

297
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to some of the shows we're going to be doing, believe me.

298
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:53,150
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we invited everybody, and, you know, the ones that came on came on, but same thing.

299
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a lot of people just...

300
00:15:56,491 --> 00:16:00,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we had people that didn't participate in our profiles.

301
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, you know, why not?

302
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:02,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take that much time.

303
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free publicity.

304
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we asked really hard questions.

306
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,344
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

307
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:11,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not out to get you.

308
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,429
[SPEAKER_01]: We're giving you the chance to have your say.

309
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're not in print, we're not even limiting it.

310
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,695
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go on as long as you want.

311
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:22,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris always asks that fun question, like, what book is on your nightstand?

312
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:22,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

313
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually ask that to the school committee.

314
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but yeah.

315
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:25,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun.

316
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:26,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to ask them.

317
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:27,805
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make that up.

318
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with us.

319
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,687
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't trying to trick anyone.

320
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't trying to ask tough questions.

321
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you watch the shows we did, they all got pretty similar questions.

322
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:37,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there was anything.

323
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually liked the candidates' nights this year.

324
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:48,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people didn't, but I love the way they did it, where they pulled them out of the fishbowl, and everybody got a different question, and you didn't have to listen to 14 people give the very same answer.

325
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought it was great.

326
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets difficult.

327
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had regular citizens send them questions.

328
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was nice, too.

329
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you have a moderator, like somebody who asks all the questions, and nobody wants that.

330
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

331
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we covered that pretty much.

332
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,673
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a good job with that.

333
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we're going to be moving on, uh, to the school committee, but before we do, uh, let's talk about the city council candidates and we have to, who did not get in.

334
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:29,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, you basically answered this already, Chris, maybe you'll answer it the same way again.

335
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:29,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

336
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,393
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't they get in?

337
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:33,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

338
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't know, except that they were not a part of the machine.

339
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:44,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was very clear that the, you know, everybody but George was our revolution.

340
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that was some

341
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:53,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, I think the majority of the voters came out because our revolution brought them out.

342
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:58,944
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't have the poll that the others did, because they were really good candidates.

343
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:03,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some candidates that I was surprised that didn't do as well as I thought that they would.

344
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:08,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I will have to say I am the worst at calling an election, so don't follow anything I will say.

345
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:09,547
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the numbers, they're close.

346
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,067
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers are all pretty close.

347
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all very close.

348
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:12,728
[SPEAKER_01]: They all did well.

349
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I thought they all did well, right.

350
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to tell you, it's not just the

351
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:21,890
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was, it's not just the city council, it's the school community.

352
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,710
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the school community, too.

353
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

354
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:23,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 100%.

355
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

356
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:24,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

357
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:32,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And... Yeah, I mean, you look at the difference between George and, uh, George Scarpelli and Liz Mullane, I mean, he... 87 votes.

358
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:32,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

359
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:34,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he beat her.

360
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, that... There are only 14.

361
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:35,732
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 votes.

362
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:36,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

363
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:43,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only 87 between Liz and, uh... Miranda, I think.

364
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:44,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.

365
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:45,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

366
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,704
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a change, right?

367
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a change.

368
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:53,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back with me, okay, about 20 years, okay?

369
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to go back to me.

370
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:59,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and so Medford at one point was, let's call it old Medford, okay?

371
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a city council that had been there forever.

372
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Old names, old families, okay, just really old.

373
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:16,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would say, we need new voices, we need younger voices, we need people with different viewpoints who haven't been in Medford all their lives in 100 years worth of,

374
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,684
[SPEAKER_02]: families and relatives, and now you have that.

375
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are the same way, right?

376
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're all the way to the other side.

377
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:30,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people are like, we need old Medford, we need older voices.

378
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:40,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't get it this time, but you saw a lot of people come out and say, I live here and I want my voice because I'm not happy with what's happening.

379
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:44,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only do you have like more people running, but you had a lot more voices.

380
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had like the average citizen

381
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,521
[SPEAKER_02]: up in arms about this is not happening in my neighborhood.

382
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And you saw those people show up at meetings about zoning or whatever they were concerned about.

383
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: They came out.

384
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: If they had come out to vote, that would have probably been better.

385
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time come out to vote.

386
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you can't complain.

387
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what we need.

388
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We need them to come out and vote.

389
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:05,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

390
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:09,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just sort of, it's like a pendulum swing.

391
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, eventually, it'll get back to the middle.

392
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:18,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember when Zack Bares was first elected, he was like the youngest person on that council that had seen that council in years.

393
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:24,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, you know, maybe the pendulum will swing back, maybe there'll be a middle and then they're like, who knows?

394
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:24,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

395
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,338
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I always think back when you say go back 20 years.

396
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: You go back 20 years and I look at the council, you know, the Bob Mayako, Bob Penta, Paul Donato, Stephanie Burke, Michael Marks, those guys.

397
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:45,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But you, the battles that went on.

398
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But you enjoyed watching them.

399
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:49,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, and they got pretty intense.

400
00:20:50,080 --> 00:21:05,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best show in town People would watch the cable and they were like a popcorn just pop But see and I was you know, I obviously I was a lot younger than but when you watch that

401
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:11,639
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that I always took hold in me was, wow, look at these guys.

402
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And these three think Medford's got to go this way.

403
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:21,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And these three and this one, they all had different opinions.

404
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of big issues back then.

405
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys know that.

406
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, but it was always about Medford.

407
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was always, it was just good to see the,

408
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,205
[SPEAKER_03]: back and forth with these guys.

409
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:49,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, like I say, they'd be done, maybe they'd go out, have a drink, whatever, I don't know, but you know, they stayed, you know, they remained basically friendly.

410
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: The city stayed together.

411
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that anymore.

412
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like.

413
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,823
[SPEAKER_02]: That's national politics.

414
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right, and I feel like it's not,

415
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,439
[SPEAKER_03]: You watch a city council.

416
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the way they treat people anymore.

417
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we always treated people with respect, dignity.

418
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:10,786
[SPEAKER_03]: There was never any of that.

419
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: The councilors went back and forth.

420
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't go back and forth with the people too much.

421
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,652
[SPEAKER_02]: The council usually just let them have their say.

422
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:18,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

423
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And listened, but they paid attention.

424
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:24,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I feel like only my opinion

425
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You start with one council, they go right down the line, with the exception of George, and it's all the same conversation.

426
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,118
[SPEAKER_03]: representing the whole city.

427
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:42,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're ruling over this city.

428
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:43,079
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

429
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I feel.

430
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, am I wrong?

431
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,320
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is a little bit that way, but that is what the people voted for.

432
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

433
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,261
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I understand that's what they voted for.

434
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,802
[SPEAKER_02]: But do they understand what they're voting for?

435
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,343
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question.

436
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question.

437
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:02,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most the average, I mean, we can sit here because not, you know, you follow politics pretty close.

438
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

439
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

440
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always do it as part of our job.

441
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:10,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're more like on the inside watching, right, just kind of sometimes shaking your head.

442
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,657
[SPEAKER_02]: But the average citizen is not watching that.

443
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.

444
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,819
[SPEAKER_02]: They're concerned with their taxes.

445
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They're concerned with their, I mean, a lot of people

446
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,684
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people said to us, I have no idea what's going on.

447
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea that we're rezoning anything.

448
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

449
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And this had been going on for two years.

450
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been going on longer than that.

451
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the end, we probably knew more about it than they did.

452
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started this in February.

453
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:35,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just started in February.

454
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

455
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

456
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

457
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:37,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

458
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be completely honest.

459
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what's going on in my city.

460
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an override.

461
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

462
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:43,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay attention.

463
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm paying more attention to what's going on in Medford.

464
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:55,377
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to, at some point, as a resident or a citizen, take a step to participate.

465
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:58,201
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to pay attention, whether the information is there or not.

466
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:02,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I always hear, well, I'm working, I have this, I have that.

467
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, look, that's no excuse.

468
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to make it a priority.

469
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:10,496
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when I was younger, you used to get, it's your civic duty.

470
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:11,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Now go vote.

471
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

472
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:13,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You went and voted.

473
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the way I feel.

474
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:17,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like it's not.

475
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: and

476
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hopefully, you know, I mean, I always believe, even if I disagree with people, you know, you give everybody a chance, we'll see what happens.

477
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:48,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe things will change this time.

478
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they'll listen, I don't, who knows, you know, maybe things will work out.

479
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interesting though, isn't it?

480
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:54,761
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

481
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:55,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always interesting.

482
00:24:55,722 --> 00:25:03,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to be interesting, and they've got, what, two years to prove it, because the charter comes, kicks in in the next election, and that's going to be a whole new ballgame.

483
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:06,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that will be a completely new ballgame.

484
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,408
[SPEAKER_02]: For everybody in the city.

485
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like going from plan E to plan A. Exactly.

486
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:16,232
[SPEAKER_02]: With a whole new ballgame then, and now it's going to be completely changed.

487
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:17,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be here before you know it.

488
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:18,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

489
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:22,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've got to just move on to the school committee.

490
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what do you think with the school committee?

491
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: What areas?

492
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:30,142
[SPEAKER_02]: No opening.

493
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,723
[SPEAKER_02]: No opening on the school committee.

494
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:32,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

495
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:32,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Two new people.

496
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:33,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Two new people.

497
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:33,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

498
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:33,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

499
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,987
[SPEAKER_01]: That says something.

500
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:37,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's the change that we're looking at.

501
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:37,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

502
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jessica Parks, I mean, she came in third.

503
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,772
[SPEAKER_01]: She was third on the ticket.

504
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:41,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

505
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So she didn't just like squeak in.

506
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike too.

507
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:44,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

508
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael had a good showing as well.

509
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:46,858
[SPEAKER_01]: He came in fifth.

510
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we do have some new people on there.

511
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:50,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

512
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're going to be great.

513
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:56,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Michael is the budget director for the city of Somerville.

514
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:56,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

515
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:00,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got certainly going to help the school committee.

516
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:00,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

517
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:07,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jessica is she's a project manager in campus construction for MIT.

518
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when you come into the high school project, you got two ringers.

519
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:12,855
[SPEAKER_00]: And maintenance.

520
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:13,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.

521
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And maintenance.

522
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a lot when it comes to that, to the high school.

523
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're going to have their work cut out for them.

524
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:21,698
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be fun.

525
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:22,358
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be fun.

526
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:22,938
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be fun.

527
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,399
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're going to be great additions to the school committee.

528
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not that Nicole and John weren't.

529
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicole and John were great.

530
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think they did a great job.

531
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Again.

532
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,000
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did.

533
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they had really good candidates.

534
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:36,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anybody, you know, that they had voted would have been fine, would have been great.

535
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:39,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

536
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be nice to see new blood.

537
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:42,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun.

538
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:43,590
[SPEAKER_01]: New blood, yeah.

539
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:49,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might have something positive to look at with the school committee.

540
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they got their work cut out for them.

541
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:51,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.

542
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that with everything that's going on.

543
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they got a lot going on.

544
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:55,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll be interesting.

545
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,165
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a new superintendent coming in.

546
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,067
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to think about that in June.

547
00:26:59,307 --> 00:26:59,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

548
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:00,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

549
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:01,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The hiring a new superintendent.

550
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:02,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

551
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: My vote is for Suzanne.

552
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucy, she's doing an amazing job.

553
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a good job.

554
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think she's she's a Medford girl.

555
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

556
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:09,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she is right.

557
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Her entire career has been her entire career.

558
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:11,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

559
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:12,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Her family's from here.

560
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Her dad was Jack Buckley.

561
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:15,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they do that.

562
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,074
[SPEAKER_01]: But nice.

563
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember.

564
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:18,175
[SPEAKER_01]: School committee guy.

565
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:18,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

566
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:18,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

567
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:19,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

568
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:19,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be great.

569
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:20,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's awesome.

570
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:24,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But I imagine they will have to go out for a search just to because they have to because they have to.

571
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:24,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

572
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to finish up with the charter.

573
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:30,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

574
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:31,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

575
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

576
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the charter.

577
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to tell you.

578
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I voted.

579
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:38,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

580
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:39,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I voted yes.

581
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:40,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it too.

582
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:41,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

583
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:42,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.

584
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:43,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to make a change.

585
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,038
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to be honest.

586
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:47,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with you.

587
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:50,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, wow, did they vote for the charter.

588
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:51,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

589
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:57,165
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been wanting a new charter since, oh my gosh, I can't.

590
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, forever.

591
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, forever.

592
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Berk came in and there was a committee that they wanted to do a charter.

593
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted a grassroots committee.

594
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted the city council to get on board.

595
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:12,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But that old council was like, we're not going to go to wards because we'll have to fight each other.

596
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:13,481
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not on board.

597
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,363
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of attempts made.

598
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one finally went through.

599
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:20,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people can see, there was a change.

600
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,867
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go with this change.

601
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:24,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can always change the charter again.

602
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's not set in stone.

603
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like about it.

604
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a living, I think Ron said it best, Melva.

605
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

606
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a living document.

607
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:35,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a charter review built in, I think, for every five years, right?

608
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:35,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.

609
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect.

610
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it did pass by almost 5,000 votes.

611
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:38,277
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.

612
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:38,717
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.

613
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with a lot of it.

614
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things I don't agree with.

615
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the school committee setup is a little weird.

616
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:51,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't understand that, but I mean, I think the mayor, four years?

617
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

618
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:53,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be.

619
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, don't you?

620
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cities and towns have done it, and it's worked out.

621
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise you're constantly running for re-election.

622
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,198
[SPEAKER_01]: You barely get a year in.

623
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,841
[SPEAKER_01]: You barely get anything done and then you're running for re-election again.

624
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.

625
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:07,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're there forever.

626
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Like McGlynn was there for 30 years.

627
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was like whatever.

628
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who ran against him he like flattened.

629
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:15,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

630
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there wasn't any opportunity.

631
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So he could get stuff done.

632
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the last two mayors, it's hard to get stuff done in two years.

633
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:25,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.

634
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:26,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

635
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.

636
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:28,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great change.

637
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's...

638
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:42,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hopefully you get good mayors, you know, but four years, I definitely think they need at least that amount of time to make, you know, to get some things done, accomplished, however you want it.

639
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:52,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not worrying about, like Chris said, you're not worrying about that every, oh my gosh, here I go again, am I going to see this project continued, is my successor, if there ever will be one.

640
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:55,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to continue the project?

641
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:56,483
[SPEAKER_02]: The project's in the works.

642
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to get anything done, like you said.

643
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:05,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really care about the school changes, I'll be completely honest, but I love the city council changes.

644
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes total sense.

645
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't believe they don't have ward counselors now.

646
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:12,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's... I love that.

647
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:14,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've never covered a community that doesn't have ward counselors.

648
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a warded community, and I love it.

649
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:20,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you why I love it, because I can call, I can pick up the phone,

650
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I can call up my city, I know who it is.

651
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,969
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who it is, you probably have their number right next to the fridge.

652
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.

653
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You can complain about stuff.

654
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes it more easy for people to be involved because it's one of your neighbors.

655
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You might see them walk by your house, the park, whatever.

656
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:44,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I love about it too is in the city I live in, in Malden, my city councilor, my ward councilor holds a little thing every year.

657
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 4th of, they do, I love it.

658
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:54,058
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 4th of July for families in the ward on one of the parks, they bring out stuff, but you get an opportunity to meet the people in your ward.

659
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You know your neighbors.

660
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:57,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who this person is.

661
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, I think, you know, people want to be represented in wards.

662
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They want people to, people in North Medford don't care that other people are like, they're like, why is this person who doesn't know what my problems are?

663
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this person all the way across town, right?

664
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people in South Medford have different problems and right.

665
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely or West No, wherever we have our own little areas and I yeah, I think it's great.

666
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:34,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that have that yeah, it's about time Chris is weirded out by the Well the school committee this so is that I mean am I reading that correctly one?

667
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna one.

668
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.

669
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,036
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna be elected by districts.

670
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:39,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's four districts.

671
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:39,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's

672
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:41,438
[SPEAKER_01]: just weird to me.

673
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:44,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen another community that does that.

674
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a school community.

675
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:50,105
[SPEAKER_01]: You represent, because you don't just represent your district.

676
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,987
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to represent all the schools equally.

677
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the schools are all over the city, so I agree.

678
00:31:56,109 --> 00:32:02,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't there a city council thing where they want, like every school, again, every school is different in every district of the city.

679
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:04,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right, it has to be, you can't be.

680
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:05,816
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be equal.

681
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:08,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you have to represent every school.

682
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:13,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's always been an argument in every community I've ever covered is equal funding for schools.

683
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they feel that having districts that this way they'll be able to do that because they'll have somebody fighting for a specific district.

684
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:21,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

685
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:26,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you're like four districts, I've got to spread the money across the four districts instead of.

686
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring that maybe more money will go here.

687
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the thinking?

688
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

689
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

690
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: was tough for me to figure out.

691
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

692
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:40,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there may be a good reason for it.

693
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they had a reason.

694
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can honestly tell you I haven't heard one yet.

695
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,663
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the mayor being knocked off as the chairman?

696
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:49,044
[SPEAKER_01]: That also surprised me.

697
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow.

698
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've never covered a community.

699
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never covered a city where the mayor wasn't the automata.

700
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's part of some deal they might have worked out or something.

701
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be.

702
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very surprised.

703
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said that was interesting.

704
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Mean that's the biggest budget.

705
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:05,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest.

706
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:16,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah She's still a voting member Yeah, yeah, but it was you know, she she was in charge put it that way and that's you know You're talking a lot of money.

707
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:23,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a huge amount of money people might say well, you know now you have a president a vice president they're able to go to the schools, but

708
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always been at the schools.

709
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny Graham is great.

710
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,565
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes out there and has a vice chair.

711
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: She's out everywhere.

712
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:33,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor goes to a ton of school stuff too.

713
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:35,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like Medford doesn't have

714
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Representation in the schools schools are a very important and big thing.

715
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the city.

716
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:47,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and have been for a long time So that's a that's a weird one.

717
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and their numbers don't change just their configuration changes.

718
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:57,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird Yeah, so the last question I have to get this thing because you mentioned the mayor so we know the mayor

719
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: ran unchallenged this election.

720
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:02,294
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

721
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:09,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think the mayor's reelection will have any impact, the important decision-making coming, the public?

722
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean... She has no reason to change.

723
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:15,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

724
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:15,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean...

725
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:18,403
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got the city council still the same.

726
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:22,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but you were talking earlier about- Although there's a little friction between them.

727
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

728
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:23,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

729
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,225
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to see.

730
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:25,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

731
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has to be.

732
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, why is that good to see?

733
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:32,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that means- Like you said, because then there's some debate on issues.

734
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:33,488
[SPEAKER_01]: There's debate.

735
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a rubber stamp.

736
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:37,310
[SPEAKER_02]: You rubber stamp her ideas, or she rubber stamps their ideas.

737
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm trying to think.

738
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You had said it earlier, and I know other people,

739
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: have said this, you know, with the mayor, with, I mean, I know they do their messaging and everything else, but do you think because she ran unelected, it's better for you?

740
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:54,915
[SPEAKER_03]: You think you'll get?

741
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

742
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:56,015
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

743
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:57,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's going to be?

744
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:57,255
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

745
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:58,335
[SPEAKER_01]: She has no reason.

746
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:59,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, she has no reason.

747
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:03,096
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, there was no call to action for her.

748
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:04,577
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, there was no threat.

749
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,997
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, it wasn't a close race.

750
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe I better change my ways.

751
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:08,738
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were 1,000 write-ins?

752
00:35:10,598 --> 00:35:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is a lot.

753
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:14,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I heard about that, yeah.

754
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard there was quite a few rumors.

755
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that was very interesting, was it?

756
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

757
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:26,263
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, I just think that she's gonna... City Hall is locked down like Fort Knox.

758
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Open up a little now.

759
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:26,963
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

760
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't think so?

761
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,484
[SPEAKER_01]: You think she's gonna relax, maybe?

762
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how long has she been doing the job now?

763
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020, she was elected in 2019.

764
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,413
[SPEAKER_02]: She took over in 2020.

765
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: She was two months in before COVID hit.

766
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and that was tough.

767
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:43,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be honest.

768
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: That was horrible.

769
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's tough.

770
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:46,735
[SPEAKER_02]: She did a great job with that.

771
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was tough.

772
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody followed Kurt Atone in Somerville.

773
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:51,857
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy did stuff.

774
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was like, well, that looks like a good idea.

775
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went with him.

776
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's hard.

777
00:35:56,598 --> 00:36:00,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was her first challenge was the pandemic and getting the city back to normal.

778
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did a great job of that.

779
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's got stuff that's happening.

780
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not out together.

781
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:07,803
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just asking questions.

782
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:10,424
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the part that people don't understand.

783
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:16,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like, if anything, people want to help you and on and on and on.

784
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:16,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We want specifics.

785
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to talk to the people who know the specifics.

786
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to be monitored like we're five-year-olds asking questions.

787
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this job for 30 years.

788
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust that I have a little integrity.

789
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But if she doesn't have someone,

790
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:31,118
[SPEAKER_03]: that ran against her.

791
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, that's to me.

792
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

793
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did nobody run against?

794
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

795
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd be if I'm the mayor and no one's running against me, I'm going to be more relaxed.

796
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I might open up a little bit.

797
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,368
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you would hope I might because what am I worried about?

798
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,569
[SPEAKER_03]: No one ran against me.

799
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:48,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, just because you're worried about two years.

800
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what you're worried about.

801
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:49,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years.

802
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,214
[SPEAKER_01]: when the charter kicks in.

803
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:57,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, the charter kicks in, right, and we're not going for every two years, we're going for every four years.

804
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you got a man that's sitting there for four years, and if you don't like them, you're like, well, in two years, no, no, that's a four-year position, like the president.

806
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:15,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's gonna be, like the president, there every four years, and then what?

807
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I think she's confident?

808
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:18,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be.

809
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

810
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:20,794
[SPEAKER_02]: She should be.

811
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But do I think she's going to give an inch?

812
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:23,518
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

813
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't think so, huh?

814
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

815
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for some reason.

816
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise us.

817
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

818
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I sometimes go with my gut feeling.

819
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I go into City Hall sometimes just to walk around and say hello to people.

820
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:36,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I've got bubonic plague.

821
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,024
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't do that anymore.

822
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:38,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk to her.

823
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:41,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes the news report.

824
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously just want to say hi.

825
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: How are the kids?

826
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:45,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how are you?

827
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have some of your candy?

828
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,129
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually what I'm looking for.

829
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:56,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the mayor needs to open up and just, like you said, give a little.

830
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:57,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

831
00:37:57,594 --> 00:38:00,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with all due respect, City Hall is supposed to be the house of the people.

832
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:01,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be open.

833
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,858
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be open to the public.

834
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way it should be.

835
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Get information.

836
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,320
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the way it should be.

837
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,002
[SPEAKER_03]: That's supposed to be information central.

838
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:08,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

839
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:09,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

840
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:10,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very odd.

841
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very odd.

842
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:18,386
[SPEAKER_03]: They like to, in my opinion, they sort of, not that they sort of, they love to control information.

843
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:18,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes.

844
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all of them.

845
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:24,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the doors, the doors are really locked with Mayor Burke's election.

846
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:26,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephanie Burke's election.

847
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:32,029
[SPEAKER_02]: She came down and said, I'm going to hire a PR person or a person to deal with my communications.

848
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to lock it down.

849
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:40,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And you as the news, because I sat with her, and was told, from now on, you have to ask my permission to speak to people.

850
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:41,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's like the Pentagon.

851
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to her, and I remember saying to her, I'm not going to ask you permission at all.

852
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:51,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call the person, and then they're going to call you for permission, because they're your employees and you're not.

853
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,014
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's gotten worse.

854
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:57,617
[SPEAKER_02]: That has gotten worse with Brianna.

855
00:38:57,697 --> 00:39:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: She just doesn't, I mean she's got people, you call them, you ask them a question, and then they never get back to you.

856
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is she afraid of?

857
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:06,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

858
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't answer that.

859
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:08,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I really can't.

860
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

861
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:10,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Claire, what are you afraid of?

862
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:11,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris wants to know.

863
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know.

864
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,933
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

865
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:15,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

866
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a better gut feeling this time.

867
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope you're right.

868
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:19,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're right.

869
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I say, we'll find out.

870
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see the city council be a little bit more open.

871
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see that.

872
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:30,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have you be able to call them like you, I think we used to in the old days.

873
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And they answered the phone.

874
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer the phone.

875
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:33,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your email.

876
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Not have to like set a time to maybe I'll get back to you in three weeks.

877
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:40,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be watching everything in two thousand days.

878
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:45,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The only person, I wouldn't say the only person, the only two people have gotten back to me with Zach Behrs.

879
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I text him and he gets back to me.

880
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one who's leaving, whose name I can't remember right now.

881
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Kit Collins.

882
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Kit.

883
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

884
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,212
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been fantastic.

885
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I text her, and she texts me back and tries to answer my questions the best I can.

886
00:39:59,234 --> 00:39:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's nice.

887
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you don't agree with them, at least if they respond.

888
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:03,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

889
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:04,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all.

890
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:05,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Just respond.

891
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to agree.

892
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Just respond with a no comment.

893
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

894
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Just respond.

895
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Something.

896
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

897
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,400
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

898
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

899
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just blow it all up.

900
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:12,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tell me no.

901
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:13,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no is fine.

902
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not going away.

903
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:14,162
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

904
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:16,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what happens.

905
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:17,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is very pessimistic.

906
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:19,325
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to be.

907
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:23,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fine line between persistence and stalking.

908
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,631
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be on the show.

909
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:27,073
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will be coming back.

910
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a few more shows.

911
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do everything.

912
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:32,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we'll keep the whole city.

913
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for inauguration day.

914
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:36,363
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

915
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:38,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of arts things going on.

916
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:40,424
[SPEAKER_02]: The city is very busy right now.

917
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a ton of stuff.

918
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:47,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And without everybody obsessing over politics right now, it'll be great.

919
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the holidays coming up.

920
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:53,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all need a break, us and the city.

921
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:58,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give one more plug for people to go to the November 18th, 4 to 7.

922
00:40:58,808 --> 00:40:59,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to City Hall.

923
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Come talk to the planning people.

924
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them your ideas.

925
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,650
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be people directly

926
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:05,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

927
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:06,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That you can speak to.

928
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:07,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

929
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I can talk to you ladies.

930
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, we could go on all night, but I can't.

931
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

932
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go for a drink after that.

933
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:15,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

934
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:17,225
[SPEAKER_02]: To the old Tiki Island.

935
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.

936
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good now.

[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta have some restaurants come on.

943
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of stuff.

944
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:31,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris actually does restaurant reviews.
