    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=0.089s">reports</a>  of subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=3.116s">Chair</a>  Graham, would you like to report out yet or do you want to also table that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=6.223s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=6.544s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.469s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=10.809s">A</a>  couple of quick notes for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=15.313s">We</a>  had our first strategic capital planning meeting around this capital plan specifically last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=23.819s">We</a>  have another meeting scheduled for November 19th to finish the draft of the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=31.545s">And</a>  after that in December, we will have a committee of the whole scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=36.449s">All</a>  of those meetings are Zoom only. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=38.89s">And</a>  we in December will have a capital plan for this group to work through, ask questions about and prioritize so that we can give direction to the district about any CPC funding we want to direct the district to apply for to the mayor and the council about the immediate capital needs and the upcoming capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.144s">etcetera.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=62.644s">So,</a>  there we had a good productive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=65.507s">It</a>  started with the input of the building principles across the district to identify some of those projects that were maybe not otherwise listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=75.936s">So,</a>  we've updated the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=77.577s">There</a>  are a number of capital projects in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=79.859s">So,</a>  those those are noted as well and there's a huge number of upcoming capital needs, not the least of which is the HVAC <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=88.146s">project</a>  at McGlynn and Andrews, but all of that is being sort of packaged up as part of the policy that we passed last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=94.911s">And</a>  we will be ready to share in a committee of the whole in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=100.676s">So</a>  right on schedule with our with our timeline so that that does not interfere with our typical budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=108.361s">Whether</a>  that interferes with other supplemental appropriation budgets is sort of a one-time thing for us to consider maybe this year, but generally speaking, I think we're on a good track to not overlap the budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=120.732s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=122.694s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=127.378s">We</a>  have our reports of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=129.54s">First</a>  up is Dr. Edouard-Vincent's updates and comments.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=136.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=137.33s">Good</a>  evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=139.092s">Welcome</a>  to tonight's school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=141.775s">Since</a>  we last spoke, our students have continued to shine and thrive in our Medford community, and I'm excited to share their recent accomplishments, as well as upcoming events in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=154.278s">Thank</a>  you to all our students, staff, community members, and elected officials who joined us at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new universally

members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=175.037s">Our</a>  health assisting CTE students and staff members have been busy supporting flu and COVID vaccine clinics held in our schools for all

athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=226.301s">All</a>  of our fall middle school sports teams captured greater Boston league conference championships last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=235.124s">Congratulations</a>  to our baseball team, our softball team, our middle boys and girls cross country teams on fantastic seasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=246.272s">I'd</a>  also like to highlight our boys high school golf team, who also earned a GBL championship since we last gathered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=256.456s">Well</a>  done to all of our student athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=260.718s">While</a>  we eagerly await seeing how the rest of the fall sports season plays out, it's not too early to think about our winter sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=269.013s">Registration</a>  for our winter sports is now open and can be done

tryouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=296.423s">Our</a>  schools, once again, will be busy this week outside of normal classroom instruction with events happening to support the futures of our Mustang students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=309.606s">On</a>  Wednesday, October 23rd, Medford High School will host our College and Career Night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=317.671s">Our</a>  annual college fair for all middle and high school students and families will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. <a

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=501.701s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=504.624s">We</a>  have a report on water testing Dr. Edouard-Vincent superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent of enrichment, innovation and operations and Department of Environmental Protection representatives, Alex Smith Lynn project manager UMass Amherst Hannah parson project manager UMass Amherst, Yvette <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=526.328s">the</a>  Pisa Program Director, and Jessica Saborowski, Environmental Analyst, Marion Borowski, Technical Assistant Provider, UMass Amherst, and Kate Gallagher, Technical Assistance Provider, UMass Amherst. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=540.455s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=540.755s">I'm</a>  going to just turn on your microphone.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=546.358s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=547.238s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=547.878s">Good</a>  afternoon, Madam Mayor and members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=549.599s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=551.42s">Sorry,</a>  red means go now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=554.534s">Thank</a>  you for this opportunity to present and have the team from UMass on with us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=560.277s">They</a>  will be presenting a slide deck momentarily to talk through. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=564.258s">But</a>  one of the reasons why we initially started this water testing was to be able to participate in what is known as the SWIG grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=574.623s">SWIG</a>  stands for School Water Improvement Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=579.266s">One</a>  statistic that I saw was that over 82% of Massachusetts schools have some type of lead in their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=585.05s">So</a>  in 2016, the governor authorized funds to be able to test water in schools and then also provide some funds for replacing drinking and bottle filling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=600.94s">in</a>  schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=601.721s">So</a>  in order for us to be eligible for that and to also have concern and the utmost focus on the best drinking water possible for our staff and students, we began testing the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=616.015s">Madam</a>  Superintendent, would you like to say anything before we move on to the team from UMass?</p>
