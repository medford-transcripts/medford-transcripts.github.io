1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,172
[SPEAKER_09]: reports of subcommittee.

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:06,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair Graham, would you like to report out yet or do you want to also table that?

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:06,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

4
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:06,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:10,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

6
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,293
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of quick notes for everyone.

7
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:22,498
[SPEAKER_05]: We had our first strategic capital planning meeting around this capital plan specifically last week.

8
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another meeting scheduled for November 19th to finish the draft of the capital plan.

9
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:35,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that in December, we will have a committee of the whole scheduled.

10
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:37,910
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those meetings are Zoom only.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:01:01,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And we in December will have a capital plan for this group to work through, ask questions about and prioritize so that we can give direction to the district about any CPC funding we want to direct the district to apply for to the mayor and the council about the immediate capital needs and the upcoming capital needs.

12
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:02,604
[SPEAKER_05]: etcetera.

13
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:05,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there we had a good productive discussion.

14
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:15,055
[SPEAKER_05]: It started with the input of the building principles across the district to identify some of those projects that were maybe not otherwise listed.

15
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:17,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we've updated the list.

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,799
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of capital projects in process.

17
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:26,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So, those those are noted as well and there's a huge number of upcoming capital needs, not the least of which is the HVAC

18
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:34,891
[SPEAKER_05]: project at McGlynn and Andrews, but all of that is being sort of packaged up as part of the policy that we passed last year.

19
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be ready to share in a committee of the whole in December.

20
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So right on schedule with our with our timeline so that that does not interfere with our typical budgeting process.

21
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether that interferes with other supplemental appropriation budgets is sort of a one-time thing for us to consider maybe this year, but generally speaking, I think we're on a good track to not overlap the budget season.

22
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:01,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

23
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:03,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

24
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our reports of superintendent.

25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,463
[SPEAKER_09]: First up is Dr. Edouard-Vincent's updates and comments.

26
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:17,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

27
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening everyone.

28
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:20,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to tonight's school committee meeting.

29
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:33,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we last spoke, our students have continued to shine and thrive in our Medford community, and I'm excited to share their recent accomplishments, as well as upcoming events in the district.

30
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:47,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to all our students, staff, community members, and elected officials who joined us at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new universally accessible playground at McGlynn Elementary.

31
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:53,562
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't have asked for a better day to celebrate the new space for our students and community members.

32
00:02:55,037 --> 00:03:06,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Our health assisting CTE students and staff members have been busy supporting flu and COVID vaccine clinics held in our schools for all students and staff.

33
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:13,503
[SPEAKER_01]: These clinics are scheduled for Wednesdays at each of our schools through early November.

34
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:26,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Our National Art Honor Society members recently joined the grand opening of the city's new Clippership Pop-Up Park.

35
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:36,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Students volunteered to paint the cement markers at the new outdoor play area alongside other community members.

36
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:41,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Their terrific artwork will further enhance the enjoyment of the new park.

37
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Switching over to athletics.

38
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:54,404
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our fall middle school sports teams captured greater Boston league conference championships last week.

39
00:03:55,124 --> 00:04:05,267

40
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:15,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to highlight our boys high school golf team, who also earned a GBL championship since we last gathered.

41
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done to all of our student athletes.

42
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:28,021
[SPEAKER_01]: While we eagerly await seeing how the rest of the fall sports season plays out, it's not too early to think about our winter sports.

43
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:35,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Registration for our winter sports is now open and can be done at medfordathletics.com.

44
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The deadline to register for our winter sports is November 18th.

45
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:54,274
[SPEAKER_01]: As a reminder, all athletes must complete the online registration and provide an up-to-date physical within 13 months to the nurse's office before tryouts.

46
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:08,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Our schools, once again, will be busy this week outside of normal classroom instruction with events happening to support the futures of our Mustang students.

47
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:16,268
[SPEAKER_01]: On Wednesday, October 23rd, Medford High School will host our College and Career Night.

51
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:56,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Beginning at 530 on Wednesday, the same day, Medford High School will also be hosting a college information session for students with IEPs and 504 accommodation plans.

52
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:15,576

[SPEAKER_01]: We have Mr. Chuck Winitzer with us, Ms.

68
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessica Guadalupe, and his son, Mr. Winitzer.

69
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:12,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it David?

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,360
[SPEAKER_01]: David, David Winitzer.

71
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:14,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

72
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

73
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:44,764
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a report on water testing Dr. Edouard-Vincent superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent of enrichment, innovation and operations and Department of Environmental Protection representatives, Alex Smith Lynn project manager UMass Amherst Hannah parson project manager UMass Amherst, Yvette

74

[SPEAKER_09]: the Pisa Program Director, and Jessica Saborowski, Environmental Analyst, Marion Borowski, Technical Assistant Provider, UMass Amherst, and Kate Gallagher, Technical Assistance Provider, UMass Amherst.

75
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:00,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

76
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to just turn on your microphone.

77
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:06,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

78
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:07,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

79
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Good afternoon, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

80
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,180
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

81
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, red means go now.

82
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:19,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this opportunity to present and have the team from UMass on with us as well.

83
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:23,558
[SPEAKER_15]: They will be presenting a slide deck momentarily to talk through.

84
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:34,043
[SPEAKER_15]: But one of the reasons why we initially started this water testing was to be able to participate in what is known as the SWIG grant.

85
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:37,805
[SPEAKER_15]: SWIG stands for School Water Improvement Grant.

86
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:44,590
[SPEAKER_15]: One statistic that I saw was that over 82% of Massachusetts schools have some type of lead in their water.

87
00:09:45,050 --> 00:10:00,260
[SPEAKER_15]: So in 2016, the governor authorized funds to be able to test water in schools and then also provide some funds for replacing drinking and bottle filling stations.

88
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,501
[SPEAKER_15]: in schools.

89
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:14,274
[SPEAKER_15]: So in order for us to be eligible for that and to also have concern and the utmost focus on the best drinking water possible for our staff and students, we began testing the water.

90
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:21,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Superintendent, would you like to say anything before we move on to the team from UMass?

91
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would just like

92
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank the team from UMass and DEP for partnering with Medford.

93
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:36,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the opportunity to speak on several occasions with Ms.

94
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:41,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Marion Berkowitz, Mr. Alex Smith-Linn, and Ms.

95
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:47,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Yvette DiPizza, just with them sharing their expertise and the work that it is that they do.

96
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to hearing from the members of the team this evening.

97
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:59,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are prepared to talk about their programming and answer any questions that may come up.

98
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, I believe all of you have been made co-hosts.

99
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alex, the document is shared with you.

100
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should be able to do it right now.

101
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:18,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want us to present?

102
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Or did you want to present it and then we kind of go through it?

103
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm willing to let you you.

104
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull the slide deck up then.

105
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,360
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no problem.

106
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

107
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:04,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

108
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:05,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everyone.

109
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:06,113
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Hannah Parson.

110
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm joined today in this presentation.

111
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:15,718
[SPEAKER_14]: My colleague, Alex Smith-Linn, we are both program managers on the MassDP UMass Amherst WaterSMART program.

112
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:23,882
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have with us today Yvette DiPisa, who is the director of the MassDP Drinking Water Program, Jessica Sabierski, who is a

113
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:34,469
[SPEAKER_14]: lead and copper lead in the MassDEP drinking water program, and two of our UMass technical assistance providers, Marion Berkowitz and Kate Gallagher.

114
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:36,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

115
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:49,210
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to start with just a brief overview of the sources and health effects of lead, just so that we're all on the same page to begin with.

116
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So lead, we know, is a dangerous and toxic metal.

117
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:58,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And although it's found in nature, most lead exposure comes from human activities and use.

118
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:04,344
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that young children, infants, and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the impacts of lead.

119
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:05,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

120
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,962
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that there is no safe level of lead for children and that even low levels of lead can negatively impact a child's development.

121
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: These impacts can include damage to the brain and nervous system, slow growth and development, as well as learning and behavior problems and hearing and speech problems.

122
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,006
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are often no initial signs or symptoms of lead exposure.

123
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,267
[SPEAKER_14]: So unless you test for lead, you often do not know that it is present.

124
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

125
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:46,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

126
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:52,296
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many different sources of lead exposure for any particular individual.

127
00:13:52,976 --> 00:14:06,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Lead has been found in some consumer products, in some paint, but EPA does estimate that drinking water can account for upwards of 20% of an individual's total exposure if lead is found in the drinking water.

128
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

129
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:16,131
[SPEAKER_14]: When we talk about lead and drinking water, it's important to understand how lead gets into drinking water.

130
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:26,696
[SPEAKER_14]: So typically lead is not found in the water that comes from your public water supplier, but leaches into the water through either lead service lines or

131
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:32,132
[SPEAKER_14]: lead plumbing or faucets or fixtures within your home or building.

132
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:42,194
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see in this graphic here, there's a couple of different examples of the types of pipes or fixtures in which lead may be found and may be causing lead to be leached into the drinking water.

133
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:50,496
[SPEAKER_14]: So this could be from a service line, which is the line that connects your public water system water main to the pipes that enter your home.

134
00:14:51,218 --> 00:15:06,899
[SPEAKER_14]: or within the pipes in the home as well, or building, in this case, a school or childcare facility, or actually in lead can be a component of the faucets or fixtures or solder or fitting that are in your sinks or other outlets.

135
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:08,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

136
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:24,256
[SPEAKER_14]: So in Massachusetts, in terms of regulations that we have here in this state, we do not have any state regulation that requires schools or child care facilities to test for lead.

137
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:37,282
[SPEAKER_14]: However, because if you don't test, you don't know if it's present, MassDEP does recommend that all schools and child care facilities test all of the fixtures that are used for drinking, cooking, or medical purposes for lead.

138
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:48,986
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we recommend that you take certain remedial actions based on those results and we'll go over what some of those potential remediation actions and follow up actions are a little later in the presentation.

139
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:50,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide please.

140
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:56,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We also wanted to make you aware of some recent federal regulations.

141
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:11,178
[SPEAKER_14]: So just earlier this month, EPA announced the lead and copper rule improvements, or the LCRI, which makes updates to requirements for public water systems around drinking water.

142
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these updates include

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,266
[SPEAKER_14]: starting in 2027, that communities or public water systems will be required to replace lead service lines within 10 years.

144
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:30,250
[SPEAKER_14]: The action level, the lead action level, has also been lowered from 15 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion.

145
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,455
[SPEAKER_14]: This means that communities would have to notify the public and take action when they test above that 10 part per billion.

146
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,377
[SPEAKER_14]: level, and then specifically for schools and childcares.

147
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:49,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting in 2027, public water suppliers will be required to offer free testing to all the schools and childcare facilities that they serve or that they provide water with.

148
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:55,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, this will not be a requirement for any testing in any school or childcare facility.

149
00:16:56,146 --> 00:17:02,049
[SPEAKER_14]: There is nothing that will regulate schools or childcares on a state or federal level to actually perform testing.

150
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:12,335
[SPEAKER_14]: This will just be a requirement that your public water supplier offers to do free testing at your school or child care facility if they provide water to that facility.

151
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:26,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So starting in 2022, MassDEP through the Water Smart Program began a pilot program to help a number of public water systems offer this testing to their schools and childcares ahead of this federal requirement.

152
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:35,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And if any school or any public water supplier was still interested, we are still offering that opportunity through our Water Smart Program.

153
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Next slide, please.

154
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so thanks, Hannah.

155
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:45,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit more about our Water Smart program.

156
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,237
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we are discussing today.

157
00:17:47,717 --> 00:18:00,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, the goal of our program is to provide free technical assistance and testing for all schools, public and private, and child care facilities throughout Massachusetts that have not previously tested in our program.

158
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:04,324
[SPEAKER_11]: DEP, we've been running a lead testing program since 2016.

159
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,826
[SPEAKER_11]: The current phase of the program has been going since 2020.

160
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:16,896
[SPEAKER_11]: The first round included comprehensive testing of all fixtures used for drinking, cooking, and health reasons.

161
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:22,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We've tested over 150 schools and 650 childcare facilities since 2020.

162
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:25,584
[SPEAKER_11]: That's in our current phase, which is known as the Water Smart.

163
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:26,624
[SPEAKER_11]: program.

164
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:41,351
[SPEAKER_11]: This effort involves many partners, including UMass Amherst, Department of Public Health, MA Water Resources Authority, the Department of Early Education and Care, as well as the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

165
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:42,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

166
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,191
[SPEAKER_11]: got a little bit cut out here.

167
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:51,933
[SPEAKER_11]: But the program process is the first step.

168
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:56,476
[SPEAKER_11]: This kind of goes through how we do the Water Smart program and our process.

169
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:00,378
[SPEAKER_11]: The first step there, everything seems to be cut out here.

170
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't see it entirely, but I can pull it up.

171
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,681
[SPEAKER_11]: The first step is to apply to the program.

172
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:14,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Then MassDEP, myself especially, will then review and accept your applications, like I said, as long as you haven't previously tested and you're a licensed

173
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:20,970
[SPEAKER_11]: child care facility or school in in the state, you will be eligible and you will be accepted to our program.

174
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:30,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Then our technical assistance providers, Marianne and Kate, among several will then contact the facility and design a sampling plan.

175
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:35,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Then sampling will be performed with the assistance of our technical assistance providers.

176
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,679
[SPEAKER_11]: The samples will then be collected.

177
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:43,881
[SPEAKER_11]: This is step five, will then be collected and mailed to a laboratory.

178
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:48,382
[SPEAKER_11]: We have several approved laboratories that we use regularly for this testing.

179
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:58,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Then to step six, we receive and kind of help you understand the results, including identifying actions to take.

180
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,668
[SPEAKER_11]: and to address any elevated levels of lead at your facilities.

181
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:13,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, step eight, we distribute information to teachers, parents, students, and deliver certificates as well as Brita filters.

182
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:21,477
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also an additional step, which is step nine, which I'll discuss later, which is the SWIG program, which we've talked about previously.

183
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,458
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not actually run.

184
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:35,390
[SPEAKER_11]: by MassDEP but we work with the Clean Water Trust to implement this program and you have to go through our program or at least have data in our EEA data portal to be able to apply to that program.

185
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide please.

186
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Also discussing Medford Public Schools testing.

187
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Why was this testing done?

188
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:53,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, Medford school districts, they were being really diligent in testing their public schools for lead as MassDEP recommends testing every three years.

189
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,802
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an entirely voluntary program that we're running.

190
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:57,783
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no mandate, as we said earlier.

191
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,865
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's very important because, you know, if you don't test, you don't know.

192
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And lead is especially dangerous for children, as we discussed earlier.

193
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:14,492
[SPEAKER_11]: So by performing this testing, Medford Public Schools are now eligible to apply for those school water improvement grants that we discussed earlier.

194
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:24,297
[SPEAKER_11]: These can provide funding for installation of water fill stations, which will ensure safe drinking water, and they can replace contaminated fixtures.

195
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:27,328
[SPEAKER_11]: in your schools.

196
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:28,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

197
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:40,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking about the public school testing, some more Medford already, they applied, that was back in January of this year at all of the schools.

198
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there was eight of them.

199
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:51,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Testing was performed in May through June of this year and results were shared subsequently with recommendations for remediation by our TAPs here.

200
00:21:52,599 --> 00:22:00,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, from our understanding, signage has already been posted throughout the schools advising against drinking water from fixtures which have found lead.

201
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:10,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Fixtures with levels above 15 parts per billion have been deactivated and are no longer in service because this is above our action level.

202
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:20,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And in addition, bottled water is being provided throughout some schools until long term remediation can be implemented, which would be

203
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,966
[SPEAKER_11]: the SWIG program.

204
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:25,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

205
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we have a little table.

206
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,353
[SPEAKER_11]: It shows some of the Medford school results.

207
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,454
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all the different schools, as you see.

208
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:46,521
[SPEAKER_11]: There's samples that are below one part per billion, from one to 15 parts per billion, and then above the action level, which is 15 parts per billion at each school.

209
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:49,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important to note that in this,

210
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:57,530
[SPEAKER_11]: table here that when we did flushing samples in a lot of cases the water was below one part per billion.

211
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:10,461
[SPEAKER_11]: That means we ran the water for approximately 30 seconds and took a second sample at a lot of these locations and then sent those to the labs and in a lot of cases the lead was significantly decreased in that second sample.

212
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:19,465
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to see these results more in depth and look, you can go on to our Energy and Environmental Affairs data portal.

213
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:20,766
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the EEA data portal.

214
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:28,570
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a link that we can provide and all the results from our lead and copper testing throughout the state will be publicly available here.

215
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:39,756
[SPEAKER_11]: You can use a lot of search parameters and change it up and see just elevated results or see all results from all schools and child care facilities, whichever you so choose.

216
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:43,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

217
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:49,040
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of going over that previous chart table that I had.

218
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So lead levels over 15 parts per billion.

219
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:53,542
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the action level.

220
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:57,183
[SPEAKER_11]: We ask you to take them out of service immediately until the problem is addressed.

221
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:00,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And sampling shows that levels are no longer elevated now.

222
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:04,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was saying earlier that that will change to 10 parts per billion in 2027.

223
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:12,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So this chart will still, or this graph here will still be the same, and you just have 10 parts per billion as opposed to 15.

224
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:20,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Lead levels between one and 15 parts per billion, we obviously always recommend long-term remediation is the most important thing.

225
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:24,940
[SPEAKER_11]: But you should still be taking steps to reduce lead exposure in the meantime.

226
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Depending on the levels, these can include daily flushing.

227
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:29,963
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was saying earlier, you can implement

228
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:42,877
[SPEAKER_11]: flushing programs, replacing fixtures and taps, those are more long-term, installing a point of use filter device, or posting not for drinking or cooking signs, which I believe have already been done at Medford schools.

229
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:48,884
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, prioritizing long-term solutions at the locations with the highest level is always the most important thing.

230
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:54,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And then for levels one parts per billion and below, we say that you can continue using them.

231
00:24:54,693 --> 00:25:02,465
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes no detections, which means there is no lead at all that's found and they can be used as normal, but we still recommend resampling every three years.

232
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:04,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

233
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:14,216
[SPEAKER_11]: For next steps, as we were discussing earlier, one of the main next step would be obviously to apply for SWIG.

234
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:18,700
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was discussing earlier, I believe that you guys have already done that.

235
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:24,805
[SPEAKER_11]: In many of these schools, these water fill stations can replace

236
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:29,211
[SPEAKER_11]: any fixture that has found lead above one parts per billion.

237
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:34,137
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not have to be above 15 parts per billion to get these filters.

238
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:41,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Signage has already been posted, as we were talking about, and flushing is always advisable to reduce lead that is built up in stagnant water.

239
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:51,115
[SPEAKER_11]: We also recommend that schools can set up a program to perform ongoing sampling as our current program does not sample facilities more than once.

240
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,036
[SPEAKER_11]: That goes back to the application process.

241
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:57,457
[SPEAKER_11]: We only accept facilities that haven't been through our program previously.

242
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:04,839
[SPEAKER_11]: These instructions for setting up your own program will be provided to the Medford School District officials.

243
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And we actually have them in a later slide as well.

244
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see that.

245
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:14,813
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, we're always happy to continue assisting with remediation plans going forward in any way we can.

246
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:16,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

247
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then talking more about SWIG.

248
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:30,597
[SPEAKER_11]: So schools that test and find lead are eligible to apply for school water improvement grants to purchase these filtered water bottle filling stations as seen on the right here.

249
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:35,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Schools have to have results in our EEA data portal to be able to apply.

250
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:37,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I again linked it right here.

251
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:38,659
[SPEAKER_11]: You can take a look.

252
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:42,305
[SPEAKER_11]: at all the data there if you want to.

253
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:49,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Grants may provide up to $3,000 per station to replace contaminated fixtures.

254
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:57,088
[SPEAKER_11]: To date, there's been over 500 grants that have been awarded to over 230 schools and child care facilities throughout the state.

255
00:26:57,888 --> 00:27:06,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Family child care programs are currently excluded from these, and the program is overseen by another of our partners, the MA Clean Water Trust.

256
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:08,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

257
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then here's more information.

258
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:17,052
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of this stuff, we have our program page right there.

259
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:19,573
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the mass.gov WaterSmart page.

260
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:20,873
[SPEAKER_11]: There's our application page.

261
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:38,599
[SPEAKER_11]: If you know anyone else who may be interested in applying for our program, childcare providers included, the EEA data portal, if you want to look at your results, feel free to use this link and contact us at lccatb.umass.edu or a program director.

262
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:43,118
[SPEAKER_11]: dwpms.gov if you have further questions about any of this stuff.

263
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

264
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:52,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And then here's the additional resources I was discussing earlier for implementing your own lead sampling program.

265
00:27:53,689 --> 00:28:00,891
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys are interested in continued testing, we do provide guidance through the Lead Contamination and Control Act program.

266
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,691
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a webpage right here.

267
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:13,813
[SPEAKER_11]: We have everything from how to develop a sampling plan, a comprehensive guide of doing testing, a list of certified labs, and different follow-up actions that you guys can take.

268
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:20,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything should be here and it can help you guys with implementing your own LCCA program if you so choose.

269
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:21,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

270
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:25,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that is all we have.

271
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,262
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone has questions, we're happy to answer.

272
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:43,091
[SPEAKER_11]: We have, as Hannah was saying, we have Yvette, our program director here, and Jessica Serberski, and both of our technical assistance providers, Maryann and Kate, if you have more technical questions about the sampling process.

273
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:46,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

274
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:52,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley.

275
00:28:56,712 --> 00:29:00,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just wondering if we can have a copy of that slideshow sent to us.

276
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Each of us can have that slideshow.

277
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Before this testing was done, was the city testing the water?

278
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the city tests the water every week.

279
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:16,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Are the schools part of that testing regularly?

280
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,357
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not weekly testing.

281
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:25,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the city does one or two locations in each school per year.

282
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:30,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So nothing extensive like what Water Smart has done for us.

283
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:38,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the testing that came from this go to the water department?

284
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,452
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the follow through in collaboration with the city?

285
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Swig Grant.

286
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,611
[SPEAKER_15]: We applied for the Swig Grant.

287
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,071
[SPEAKER_15]: It's two phases.

288
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:56,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Phase one is the initial verification application, and then that was done on October 3rd.

289
00:29:56,513 --> 00:30:00,334
[SPEAKER_15]: We were notified that we were moved on to phase two on October 15th.

290
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:04,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Marianne and I will be working on that, and then Marianne O'Connor and I

291
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:07,997
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll work on a plan moving forward.

292
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:11,420
[SPEAKER_15]: These results are all shared on the state website.

293
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:19,645
[SPEAKER_15]: They are also updated with all of our remediation actions based on the recommendations in the Excel spreadsheets that were shared with us.

294
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:35,776
[SPEAKER_15]: So that work, with the exception of one location that I just have to verify of flushing, is every single, the hundreds of locations that were done are all updated as of this past Friday night.

295
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:41,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, anything our water department Mr. Sousa, I believe.

296
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:43,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Received results.

297
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And he forwarded them to the schools over the summer.

298
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:49,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the Department of Public Health.

299
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,589
[SPEAKER_08]: The plan moving forward.

300
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:54,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we be notified what the plan is going to be moving forward?

301
00:30:57,954 --> 00:30:58,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

302
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:00,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think that might be it.

303
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:02,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

304
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:07,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

305
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:18,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is a question for the folks on Zoom, but I was curious how many filling stations we would be eligible for in Medford.

306
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it per number of students?

307
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it based on square footage?

308
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,130
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you decide how many we would be eligible for under the grant?

309
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:30,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't directly deal with that.

310
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,181
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the MA Clean Water Trust.

311
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:38,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a program that we work with, but we don't actually give out those grants ourselves.

312
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,729
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would have to ask them.

313
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen over 50 in some cases.

314
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:50,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was with Worcester, but I don't have any more knowledge about that currently.

315
00:31:51,623 --> 00:32:01,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're typically eligible for one for every fixture that tests above, every eligible fixture that tests above one part per billion.

316
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:09,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would have to look back at your results for which of those fixtures would specifically be eligible, but there's no limit.

317
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: It's based on which ones would be needed to be replaced.

318
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's fabulous.

319
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

320
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:27,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other question that I had was, are the results that we saw here unusual in any way?

321
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:31,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my first thought was like, how do we have all this like lead in our fixtures?

322
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:39,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just didn't know if this was unusual in some way for us or if this is pretty common based on what you see in other districts.

323
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:45,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We do see a lot of situations with similar results.

324
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:54,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically, it's in schools that are built prior to 1988, because that was when they stopped using lead in pipes.

325
00:32:56,293 --> 00:33:04,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But it isn't infrequent to see lead above one part per billion in more recently renovated schools as well.

326
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:17,719
[SPEAKER_14]: About 65% of the schools and childcares that have tested through our program have at least one fixture that tests above one part per billion.

327
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:20,881
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very common to find lead in facilities.

328
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

329
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:31,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That is just helpful context to understand because our buildings were not generally built before 1986.

330
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:47,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So is the typical remediation, I know it's different for everybody, but is the typical remediation at that point, simply replace, I'll say simply, but simply replacing the fixtures, or are there other potential things that need to happen in terms of our planning?

331
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I think typically, yes.

332
00:33:55,551 --> 00:34:00,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, implementing flushing programs is something that we regularly suggest as well.

333
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:13,661
[SPEAKER_11]: That's typically if the results are not above 15 parts per billion, the action level, like I said, if it's above 15 parts per billion, we ask you to take those offline immediately until they're replaced completely.

334
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:18,824
[SPEAKER_11]: But from anything from one to 15, we typically suggest flushing.

335
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:22,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, prioritizing long-term remediation

336
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:23,307
[SPEAKER_11]: efforts.

337
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:26,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

338
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:37,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will just note to the committee that we will put this faucet replacement remediation on the capital plan as well, just so we don't lose track of it.

339
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, from the chair, I think the slide was, I think it was a third or fourth slide.

340
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:44,166
[SPEAKER_09]: It showed that

341
00:34:45,177 --> 00:35:00,058
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have lead pipes outside the building you can have lead in the pipes throughout the building, it could be in the fixtures there's, I think there was four different ways that lead could be coming into these schools, and we don't know what the reason is.

342
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:14,335
[SPEAKER_09]: facilities and grounds director from the city was notified of this probably beginning of last week, the week before, and immediately took action to start testing the fixtures.

343
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:20,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got replacement fixtures, and we're going to be retesting those locations that we're going to test out.

344
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't know the cause of

345
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,493
[SPEAKER_09]: yet of why we have lead in our new schools that were built far after 1988, but we are working to get to the bottom of it.

346
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:33,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

347
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:37,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld.

348
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so this presentation was very much about remediation.

349
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:58,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I am wondering, while we have these folks on the line, if there's anything we need to be keeping in mind for a new building that could potentially be coming to Medford in the next few years, we hope.

350
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say just try to sign it up and probably get it tested again.

351
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:11,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, we always recommend testing in facilities, including new facilities.

352
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:17,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We have found situations where even new buildings will have elevated lead or copper levels.

353
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's important to do testing.

354
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:24,699
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of the day, there is no mandate, but as we said, we always recommend it.

355
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Also too, we work with the plumbing board and the plumbing inspectors.

356
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:43,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So as part of a new building being constructed and you're following the local plumbing codes, they are going to be checking to make sure that the piping that they're putting in is lead free.

357
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:48,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you will be doing testing before you put that water line into service.

358
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:52,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And if in fact something is identified at that point,

359
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: the building does not go online until they have addressed these issues.

360
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be for electrical and any other one of the services that would go to a building.

361
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:05,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, of course.

362
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there resources available to help with some of that?

363
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:17,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not remediation if it hasn't happened yet, but you mentioned grants for getting filling stations.

364
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:22,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that sort of thing available for new installations?

365
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:41,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the sampling part of it, there'd be funding if you're part of the SWCC program, we'd like to, for instance, when you install like a bottle water filling station, that has to test out and ensure that it's meeting the standards and that testing is covered.

366
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:48,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not that clear on a new building, but I can certainly find out and we can get back to you on that.

367
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:50,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

368
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:52,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

369
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna go to a member in Tapa.

370
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:59,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.

371
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:07,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Mayor, for also the clarification on the possible, the fact that we just still don't know what's going on.

372
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And I find that deeply unsettling, and we gotta figure that out.

373
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:16,511
[SPEAKER_16]: My questions with the data presented, do we know,

374
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:21,256
[SPEAKER_16]: It's listed here, the Medford High Complex is listed as one item line.

375
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:33,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know the breakdown of faucets or fixtures, I guess is the better phrase, that are impacted in the high school versus the vocational buildings?

376
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know the proportional difference between the two if one was more impacted than the other?

377
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:46,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, no, that was just one question.

378
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:49,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I suppose I could go through and look at each location but

379
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:54,605
[SPEAKER_15]: it was not differentiated for that.

380
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:56,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just seen as one Medford High School.

381
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:57,126
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, cool.

382
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:58,826
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I just wanted a clarification on that.

383
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:15,910
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33.

384
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:23,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening.

385
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:30,336
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools.

386
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:35,438
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that.

387
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:40,260
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is?

388
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the last number I saw was June.

389
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this?

390
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Like when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?

391
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:58,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We were receiving results from June on, depending on the building.

392
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:02,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

393
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:10,791
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's all I have, but just wanted to thank MassDV for doing this great work and for helping us figure this all out.

394
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:13,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's all I have to say.

395
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:13,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

396
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:21,834
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just address the, I can't speak to the why, as Madam Mayor said with, you know, multiple possible reasons.

397
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:30,206
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing that Director Riggi mentioned during our conversation last week was that up until I believe it was 2014,

398
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:37,677
[SPEAKER_15]: lead was still being used in both solder and the plumbing fixtures themselves.

399
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:45,230
[SPEAKER_15]: So even though I believe it was 1986 when the Clean Water Act restricted lead pipes,

400
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:49,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that was still being allowed to happen.

401
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:53,674
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, we're replacing as the mayor mentioned.

402
00:40:54,174 --> 00:40:54,935
[SPEAKER_15]: We're right now.

403
00:40:54,955 --> 00:41:02,261
[SPEAKER_15]: We're placing two faucets at the worst locations in each building, faucets, fixtures in each building.

404
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:10,708
[SPEAKER_15]: We will then go back and retest those to see where we are on the numbers following the protocols that were outlined here.

405
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:32,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just point out, even though it's concerning, I think we all know that every faucet or any place that tested over the 15 kilobytes per billion has a sign on the faucet now as of October 3rd.

406
00:41:33,144 --> 00:41:36,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Brooks was sooner saying hand wash only.

407
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:41,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

408
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:44,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

409
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:53,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these fixtures, I mean, we were talking about one part per billion, 15 parts per billion.

410
00:41:54,836 --> 00:42:00,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we have a sink at Medford High with 967 parts per billion.

411
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:09,127
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing is, is that all of the really bad stuff isn't at Medford High.

412
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the worst two are at Medford High.

413
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:19,402
[SPEAKER_12]: 235 parts per billion at the Andrews, 180 at the McGlynn Middle.

414
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:27,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there are 176 fixtures over 15 parts per billion.

415
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:41,635
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm obviously very interested in mitigation, but I really hope that how we are here and why we are here doesn't get any kind of sugarcoating.

416
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,110
[SPEAKER_12]: No sugarcoating.

417
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

418
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,012
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not okay.

419
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:56,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, 967 parts per billion, I bet DCF would take a kid out of a house.

420
00:42:57,335 --> 00:42:57,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

421
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:05,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that's like, well, I can't do that kind of math at this hour that quickly, but hundreds of times over.

422
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:10,845
[SPEAKER_12]: the maximum amount before you have to shut down equipment.

423
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:16,591
[SPEAKER_12]: So I look forward to the results of the investigation.

424
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:26,680
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to all the very graphic detailed reports explaining what was snaked and looked at and where every fixture that does get replaced, I want those fixtures saved.

425
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:33,056
[SPEAKER_12]: need to know where they came from, how they were purchased, how did we end up with them, if it was a fixture.

426
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:36,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously if it's not a fixture then we got to find the root cause.

427
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:45,468
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't want it to just be we replace the 376 fixtures, it costs a million dollars or whatever it costs, and we throw them all in the dump.

428
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:48,532
[SPEAKER_12]: There needs to be answers.

429
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:52,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for the Medford High stuff, the answer is that's what it was when we built it.

430
00:43:53,055 --> 00:44:14,011
[SPEAKER_12]: But for everything else, I want to know who received funding to sell us a piece of equipment that was not necessarily allowed at that point in time, because I just can't believe that these levels are a result of purchasing the appropriate stuff and putting it in front of children.

431
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:23,553
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do have a question about whether or not it makes sense for the school committee to draft a policy on required testing.

432
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:30,256
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that's very unclear right now is like, what does it cost to test every fixture in our whole school system?

433
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:36,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, is it $50,000 a year or is it a vastly bigger number?

434
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And without that number, it feels like

435
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:42,206
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, my gut test everything every single year.

436
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:48,494
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you tell me it's going to cost a million dollars a year, then my gut starts to feel a little less comfortable with that.

437
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:52,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So I understand that this testing we weren't paying for, correct?

438
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, our program.

439
00:44:56,537 --> 00:44:57,098
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a grant.

440
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:05,924
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, if we can get an estimate for what it would actually cost for us to do this on the regular, I would like to know that.

441
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:13,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of how much on the regular would depend very much on the investigation as to how we are here and why we are here.

442
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:24,497
[SPEAKER_12]: If we find out that this certain fixtures were purchased and they had lead in them and we replaced them, then it makes sense that we don't have to test those fixtures regularly.

443
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:28,174
[SPEAKER_12]: But those schools are 24 years old.

444
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:37,418
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm looking back at the data on the state's website there are a few from 2016 or 2018 but pretty much nothing ever since.

445
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:41,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to make sure we're never, we don't leave a future school committee.

446
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:50,213
[SPEAKER_12]: and certainly kids and staff to discover that they've been consuming this stuff for decades.

447
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:55,537
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's, I don't know if I have a question, but those are my comments.

448
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:56,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

449
00:45:56,277 --> 00:45:57,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

450
00:45:58,038 --> 00:45:58,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade.

451
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:02,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

452
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:16,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a question for both the DEP team or the assistant superintendent comments about flushing protocol I understand that every three years with the LCR rule suggests that that's been like the EPA suggesting every three year for testing but

453
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:23,069
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go above the 15 parts per billion, it changes to a different protocol timeline.

454
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,212
[SPEAKER_00]: What does flushing actually mean?

455
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I keep hearing it, but I want to understand better, like, what that protocol actually looks like.

456
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:29,397
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the methodology that we use?

457
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:33,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that we do that compared to some other method of cleaning up the system?

458
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:34,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

459
00:46:42,902 --> 00:46:54,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so on the pictures that we are flushing, which are very few in comparison to the total number, those are controlled by either kitchen or nursing staff.

460
00:46:55,607 --> 00:47:07,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, we we posted every fixture in the district, regardless of result, um, to to make sure that we were being on the safe side when we got these results back.

461
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:20,459
[SPEAKER_15]: The reality is, is that myself and Director O'Connor were uncomfortable leaving Flushing in every other location.

462
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:25,070
[SPEAKER_15]: we couldn't reliably say that it would be conducted.

463
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:34,737
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's in a nurse's office or kitchen or a place like that, we can reliably say that someone will flush it, all right?

464
00:47:36,238 --> 00:47:37,399
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's 30 seconds.

465
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,241
[SPEAKER_15]: It's done at the beginning of the day.

466
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:44,604
[SPEAKER_15]: I think most people are actually running it for longer than 30 seconds.

467
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:50,728
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can also, for safety's sake, do it multiple times during the day.

468
00:47:52,308 --> 00:48:08,293
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe in one of the conversations with members of the team online to do it at three o'clock as well if the water has been sitting, but it is done at the beginning of the day to make sure that it is flushed in those limited locations.

469
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:14,515
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a flushing of the entire water system, it's just specific portions of the building?

470
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:14,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

471
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:31,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess I actually want to agree with my fellow committee member I think that there should be some explanation about how the actual costs, how we're incurring those costs of the, the yearly or try yearly testing just because I think that there's a way for us to

472
00:48:31,938 --> 00:48:50,380
[SPEAKER_00]: afforded if depending what the cost would be to having a more more consistent process just because evidently even though we these buildings were built post the 84 rule about changing the piping that's still an issue evidently so I think there is a way for us to kind of have a conversation about testing more consistently I would like to know how to do that as well.

473
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:52,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

474
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: DEP would also like to just touch upon the flushing programs.

475
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually send around notices like after holidays and periods where students are out of the schools, we encourage flushing because what flushing does, the intent is to bring water from the street where we know that the public water supply is providing water

476
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:26,228
[SPEAKER_02]: that does not have elevated lead levels to bring that water into the school and to the taps.

477
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to mention that use pattern

478
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:51,672
[SPEAKER_02]: is also very important because we have noticed that when you find very elevated levels of lead, when you look at the use pattern, you may find out that that particular faucet is not being used and therefore the accumulation of lead or other buildup.

479
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:56,041
[SPEAKER_02]: might be why you're getting really high levels at a particular point.

480
00:49:57,742 --> 00:50:13,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Our experience is that in some schools we have said if you're not going to be using this faucet on a regular basis that maybe you don't need that faucet and therefore they can go to another location on the same level where there's more active use.

481
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:23,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also identified that faucets within classrooms that, for whatever reason, don't get used tend to have higher levels.

482
00:50:24,303 --> 00:50:26,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be something we would encourage you to look at.

483
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:36,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at your use pattern as you determine where you're going to put your bottle water filling stations or to encourage

484
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:48,604
[SPEAKER_02]: the students to drink and to also look at our information on flushing because we have a lot of guidance on our web page on how to do that and maybe work with our TA providers as needed.

485
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:50,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

486
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:54,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

487
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:55,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

488
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Rutherford.

489
00:50:57,311 --> 00:51:01,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to everybody from DEP for being on the call to answer our questions.

490
00:51:01,554 --> 00:51:02,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

491
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:11,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a report on the district-wide busing, Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation and Operations, Ms.

492
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:19,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Megan Fidler-Carey, Director of Family and Community Engagement, and Mr. Chuck Winitzer, owner of Eastern Bus Company, and Ms.

493
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:23,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Jessica Guadalupe, Eastern Bus Medford Manager.

494
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:25,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, everybody.

495
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:25,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here.

496
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:28,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it over to you, Dr. Cushing.

497
00:51:31,192 --> 00:51:35,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Mayor, just making Miss Fedley-Cowrie a co-host as well.

498
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:38,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this opportunity.

499
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:44,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So Medford Public Schools is in the last year of a five-year contract with Eastern Bus Company.

500
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,175
[SPEAKER_15]: We're currently working on our procurement

501
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:49,736
[SPEAKER_15]: for the next contract.

502
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:58,760
[SPEAKER_15]: We currently run 14 buses at the Medford Public Schools, one bus for North Medford at Medford High School.

503
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:03,663
[SPEAKER_15]: The rest of transportation there is reliant on MBTA transportation.

504
00:52:04,383 --> 00:52:05,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we run

505
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:09,585
[SPEAKER_15]: the buses combined for our middle schools.

506
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:18,446
[SPEAKER_15]: All students walk from the McGlynn to the Andrews at the end of the day, board the buses there, and then are moved throughout the city to their bus stops.

507
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:36,150
[SPEAKER_15]: We have buses also for our elementary schools, as you know, but we also now offer and are trying to offer more transportation for families looking for aftercare, specifically to RSK, Ready, Set, Kids, and

508
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it is called Sigma.

509
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:42,204
[SPEAKER_15]: And at this time, Ms.

510
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:43,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Fidelicari, if you have anything else to add.

511
00:52:45,906 --> 00:52:57,289
[SPEAKER_03]: That summed it up really well that, you know, contractually the state rules, as you've said, forgive me if I reiterate, state rules say that we are obligated to transport students who live more than two miles away from the schools.

512
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:06,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have an even more generous policy in Medford where at the elementary level, we've got in our policy that we transport students who live more than a mile away from the schools.

513
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:13,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But knowing that afterschool care is a concern and a need for our families,

514
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:20,681
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing our best to also provide transportation after in the afternoons to the private providers throughout the city.

515
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:25,729
[SPEAKER_03]: As they're getting more of them, that means more students to transport.

516
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:27,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a challenge.

517
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There are numbers, but we're working on it and doing our best.

518
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And the afterschool programs are terrific partners, and they're working really closely with us to try and perfect any logistics that change or that are challenging.

519
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:43,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're good partners.

520
00:53:43,374 --> 00:53:46,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to put that out there and thank them publicly right here, right now.

521
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:55,296
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll invite members of Eastern Bus to the podium, and I'll happily stand by.

522
00:53:56,537 --> 00:53:56,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

523
00:53:56,857 --> 00:53:57,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

524
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:15,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we came because the superintendent has been speaking with me, you know, over the beginning of the year till now.

525
00:54:16,027 --> 00:54:16,527
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also

526
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been working with everyone we can to try and put things together.

527
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:24,560
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a difficult situation.

528
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:35,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if everybody knows that it is a serious driver shortage problem that every company is having.

529
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:40,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we do a bunch of districts, MedFed being one of them.

530
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:42,418
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been doing MedFed for a long time.

531
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:47,322
[SPEAKER_13]: And since the pandemic, it's a struggle to keep everything full.

532
00:54:48,263 --> 00:54:53,548
[SPEAKER_13]: We try, but we train as much as we can.

533
00:54:54,528 --> 00:55:00,894
[SPEAKER_13]: As a company, five years ago, we bought a building up in Barreca just to set up our own training course.

534
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:05,051
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was approved by the state, and we do all our training there.

535
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:09,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a big piece for us trying to stay up.

536
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,277
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, we are training many people.

537
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:20,103
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have people testing, but one of the issues we have is we're trying to support all the communities we have.

538
00:55:20,243 --> 00:55:26,628
[SPEAKER_13]: So we get one guy, we move him to a place, another guy, usually depends on where they live.

539
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the biggest thing.

540
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,873
[SPEAKER_13]: And Malden, we don't have, you know, the most drivers coming from there.

541
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:37,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of them are coming from Dorchester, Roxbury, whatever.

542
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:42,180
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a little easier to get them in different situations.

543
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,045
[SPEAKER_13]: But MedFed has a bunch of guys that come in from Dorchester and Brockton to drive.

544
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:50,287
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them have been with us a long time.

545
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:52,949
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are trying to get it together.

546
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:57,634
[SPEAKER_13]: We did get the word, you know, late in the spring that you were looking to add.

547
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:09,507
[SPEAKER_13]: And at that time, we just we knew going into the fall, one of the big problems we have is people, you know, they collect unemployment for the summer.

548
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:15,334
[SPEAKER_13]: They promise that they're coming back and then we get to September and we lose 10, 12, 15 people.

549
00:56:15,935 --> 00:56:23,157
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been consistent over the past five years that this has been something that happened and we saw it coming.

550
00:56:23,657 --> 00:56:32,879
[SPEAKER_13]: So we prepared for it and we got 15, 16 guys to start, but they were all just brought in and put right into routes we needed right away.

551
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,001
[SPEAKER_13]: We were able to right away get the 14 buses for Medford with the word that

552
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:42,487
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's any way we can add two more buses, that's what they want.

553
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:44,248
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to add two more buses.

554
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:50,852
[SPEAKER_13]: And we told them, as soon as we see the situation where we can do it, we're going to do it.

555
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:52,893
[SPEAKER_13]: We're working hard on it.

556
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:55,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford is on the top of the list.

557
00:56:56,015 --> 00:56:57,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody will get one first.

558
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:01,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we get a second one, that's when we'll push the second one in.

559
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:07,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are trying very hard to get into the situation that Medford wants at this time.

560
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:16,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, I've spoken to the mayor, Jessica has spoken to Megan over and over about what we're trying to do.

561
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,001
[SPEAKER_13]: We've worked as hard as we can to get any overages covered.

562
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:26,383
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done everything we can to get all the buses going where they have to go and getting them there on time.

563
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:28,563
[SPEAKER_13]: The regular buses are running excellent.

564
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,464
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we've worked hard to

565
00:57:31,144 --> 00:57:32,564
[SPEAKER_13]: get control of the overages.

566
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,165
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have any overages.

567
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,425
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't for a while.

568
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:39,446
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the beginning of the year, you actually run into it.

569
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:44,367
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know a bus is going to have 70 kids when last year it only had 44.

570
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:46,588
[SPEAKER_13]: But it happens every year.

571
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:48,328
[SPEAKER_13]: We know what we have to make for adjustments.

572
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:52,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And with Megan and Jessica, we've been able to put everything together.

573
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the biggest thing you're looking for is the after-school program, which

574
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:00,081
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what do we do?

575
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:05,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we cover athletic or do we cover a late school?

576
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:06,845
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

577
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,066
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not really a late school, but it's an afterschool.

578
00:58:09,926 --> 00:58:16,830
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do have some commitment to athletics, but we even make them wait and try and get the regular buses first.

579
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Even this one goes before an athletic event.

580
00:58:20,972 --> 00:58:27,175
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so we did reach out and say, whenever we have a spare person,

581
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to put them over there and we're going to bring them back.

582
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:40,354
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it's been working, you know, not every day, but it does work whenever we get a chance, we do send a bus over to Roberts, right.

583
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:41,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Brooks.

584
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:48,023
[SPEAKER_13]: We send it over to Brooks to get the kids to where they got to go earlier, you know, at two 30, which is, I know that's what you're looking for.

585
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:52,934
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are, we are looking, working very hard on trying to get more drivers in.

586
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:55,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, we're training as quick as we can.

587
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:57,138
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes time.

588
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:01,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not used to be that we could turn guys around in three, four weeks.

589
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:04,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's a month, two months.

590
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:08,507
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is a whole different process than it was five years ago.

591
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:12,590
[SPEAKER_13]: The registry of motor vehicle does not work well with us.

592
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:17,394
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they were doing pretty good, but you know, you're still every driver,

593
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,491
[SPEAKER_13]: for any reason, flunks the first time.

594
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:27,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's always a second test because, you know, the registry is very difficult and tight with their regs.

595
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:28,395
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter what it is.

596
00:59:28,415 --> 00:59:31,517
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be the smallest thing and they call them on it.

597
00:59:31,657 --> 00:59:35,119
[SPEAKER_13]: As soon as you make any mistake at all, the test ends and you start again.

598
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:37,500
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to go for another test and start again.

599
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,601
[SPEAKER_13]: It was brutal over the summer.

600
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:46,425
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a brutal time and all of the bus companies, Stan being the major,

601
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:55,383
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, person that everybody works through, they have an organization for all the school bus companies in the state.

602
00:59:55,883 --> 01:00:00,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody filed a complaint because the registry just decided, you know, a year ago, they weren't going to pass anybody.

603
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:01,665
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't care what it was.

604
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:08,167
[SPEAKER_13]: You take three, four tests for us to get somebody passed and everybody complained and they did readjust it.

605
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:15,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the big things you have is when they change a trooper and they changed, you know, what they were doing, they're going to change a little bit.

606
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:23,626
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and that's when we run back into and we just ran into that, you know, the last couple of weeks, we had a couple of guys that didn't make it through.

607
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:25,828
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have a few tests coming up.

608
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:27,729
[SPEAKER_13]: We have tests coming up this month.

609
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,933
[SPEAKER_13]: We have tests coming up in November, because the other thing is we don't get

610
01:00:33,177 --> 01:00:33,917
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the choice.

611
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:37,758
[SPEAKER_13]: It is, you know, 50 companies all trying to get tests.

612
01:00:38,658 --> 01:00:40,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's very hard to get the test.

613
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:42,639
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes a few weeks for us to get a test.

614
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Once we have the driver in a position for him to go to have a test.

615
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,601
[SPEAKER_13]: So once he has his hours and once we feel comfortable with him, we put him right in for a test.

616
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:56,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So like I said, as soon as we can turn it around, you know, it's not a bus problem.

617
01:00:57,062 --> 01:00:58,922
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nothing but a driver problem.

618
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:08,815
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so we are, you know, and I've been talking to everybody here to try and let them know we are working on it.

619
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:14,058
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I have, like I said, I have every community I have is looking for extra buses.

620
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:21,924
[SPEAKER_13]: It's across the board right now that every city I have is requesting two buses, three buses.

621
01:01:22,564 --> 01:01:22,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

622
01:01:22,944 --> 01:01:24,685
[SPEAKER_09]: We have just a few questions.

623
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:25,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

624
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:28,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

625
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:29,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Jenny.

626
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being here.

627
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,396
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of questions.

628
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:42,203
[SPEAKER_05]: How, when you think about the people that are in the pipeline to be tested, how many of them are coming to Medford and do you have any timeline at all?

629
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,245
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we don't know when they're gonna pass.

630
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:51,409
[SPEAKER_13]: We have guys, like I said, you know, we have yards all over the area.

631
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:55,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, it kind of goes where the guy lives.

632
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,990
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't try and just do that.

633
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,571
[SPEAKER_13]: But if somebody lives in Malden, Medford, Melrose, anywhere over in this area, they're going to Medford.

634
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:06,612
[SPEAKER_13]: We have drivers that come in that live up near Lowell Barrica.

635
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:07,752
[SPEAKER_13]: They go to the Barrica Yard.

636
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:10,513
[SPEAKER_13]: We have guys down in Randolph and Brockton.

637
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:12,873
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them go to Newton or Wellesley.

638
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:14,394
[SPEAKER_13]: We're spread out.

639
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:19,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So until we know where the guy is, we try and work with the people.

640
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:25,096
[SPEAKER_13]: If you live in Medford or this area, we say, we're going to move you to Medford, and they're fine.

641
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:32,201
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we take somebody from Brockton that has a friend in Newton and says, I'd rather go to Newton, we can't push him, we won't get him.

642
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:40,267
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take a guy and try and put him in Medford and he wants to be in Newton, he's not gonna stay with us, he's gonna leave on us.

643
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:53,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do have guys that if they pass in the next few weeks from the area, I have a couple from Medford, Cambridge, some of this area that are going to be tested.

644
01:02:54,428 --> 01:02:58,491
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't guarantee when they pass, but as soon as they do, we'll move them.

645
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:05,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Best case scenario, maybe Thanksgiving, maybe three or four weeks, depending on what occurs.

646
01:03:05,576 --> 01:03:15,103
[SPEAKER_17]: If nobody leaves, because it's a fluid situation, I'll think we're confident within the next six to eight weeks, we should be able to add two drivers to the city of Metro.

647
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:17,424
[SPEAKER_17]: But things can change very quickly.

648
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:18,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

649
01:03:20,618 --> 01:03:34,282
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of other things I think just strategically, there's a lot of conversation in Medford about the huge thousand kids who are not eligible for transportation to the middle and the high schools because they live between one and two miles.

650
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And your bus drivers can probably tell you that traffic around Medford is a nightmare.

651
01:03:39,803 --> 01:03:49,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I am shocked that anybody gets to school on time at Medford High because I live a few blocks away and it's like impassable to get through there.

652
01:03:50,186 --> 01:03:53,608
[SPEAKER_05]: even until almost eight o'clock and school starts at like 740 or something.

653
01:03:53,668 --> 01:04:03,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the other thing that we're talking about is all of those people who are driving their kids to school, that's a hardship for them.

654
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:10,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad for our roads and it would be far more efficient to put those kids on a bus.

655
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:12,419
[SPEAKER_05]: We obviously don't have the money to do that right now.

656
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:23,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that is to change like we I think we could be in a position that when we go out to bid we would be looking for additional buses and I think.

657
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:32,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be interested to know from you all how we can help the bus driver shortage situation.

658
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:40,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure there's much we can do, but if there is something we can do, please let us know because it's really important that kids get to school on time.

659
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:43,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the bus is late, that's a problem.

660
01:04:43,257 --> 01:04:46,840
[SPEAKER_05]: If their parents can't drive them and they're walking two miles, that's a problem.

661
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:50,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanna make sure that we're doing what we can to support

662
01:04:51,863 --> 01:04:55,744
[SPEAKER_05]: you all as you think about getting additional drivers here.

663
01:04:55,764 --> 01:05:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: The other comment I did have about the afterschool programs in the afternoons, I appreciate the willingness to send the buses when they are available.

664
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:11,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is a huge help.

665
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:15,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And the folks whose kids are sitting and waiting

666
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: for a really long time are really appreciative.

667
01:05:18,552 --> 01:05:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: They obviously want that to already have happened and be done yesterday.

668
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:31,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was talking to some parents recently, and they were talking about how their kid spends an hour on the bus from the Roberts to the square.

669
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:35,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And you all made some sort of route adjustment recently.

670
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:42,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And the parent sought me out to tell me that the change was dramatic for their kids getting off at their after-school program.

671
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:48,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the difference but it was like a 40 minute 45 minute difference so thank you for that.

672
01:05:50,091 --> 01:06:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am, I am interested in where else our roots can be optimized like that so that kids are not sitting on the bus because the truth is they're sitting in the elementary schools for some amount of time before they even get on the bus.

673
01:06:04,426 --> 01:06:09,511
[SPEAKER_05]: for kids to not be getting to an after school program till like after 4pm 430.

674
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:16,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very, very long time to wait and parents are paying for those services that they're not getting so

675
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:34,767
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are other route optimizations that can happen, I assume you use some sort of geo software that helps map the routes, but we would certainly be interested in anything you can do to support route optimization to get kids to their destination just a little bit faster.

676
01:06:34,787 --> 01:06:38,150
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not a whole lot.

677
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:41,879
[SPEAKER_13]: in Medford or any other city we can do with traffic.

678
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:47,404
[SPEAKER_13]: But if I see something, I know what day they go and I look and see what they did.

679
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:54,189
[SPEAKER_13]: If they're doing something that I think they can do better or Jessica, we'll look into it straight.

680
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:55,830
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do the best we can.

681
01:06:55,890 --> 01:07:01,935
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are certain times you just can't move.

682
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:05,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything happens on the highway and Medford closes.

683
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,971
[SPEAKER_13]: We know.

684
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,413
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on Mystic Ave.

685
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:12,134
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on Mystic Ave now.

686
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:14,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I drive by all the time.

687
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:20,461
[SPEAKER_13]: We see the backups on the highway from in front of us and on the other side of Mystic Ave.

688
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:21,342
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does.

689
01:07:21,462 --> 01:07:24,345
[SPEAKER_13]: As soon as there's a problem on the highway, everybody jumps off.

690
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:25,886
[SPEAKER_13]: especially in the square.

691
01:07:26,086 --> 01:07:26,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

692
01:07:26,367 --> 01:07:31,211
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just shuts it down because the lights, you know, you have too many lights and too many people trying to get through it.

693
01:07:31,332 --> 01:07:36,016
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will we will look into it if we see that it's taken too long.

694
01:07:36,076 --> 01:07:39,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And the person that did it, you know, they just didn't go the right way.

695
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:40,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll fix it.

696
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:46,473
[SPEAKER_17]: It is also that we have to take when the logistics of transportation come in, we also have to take the headcounts in.

697
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:47,554
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we do headcounts.

698
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,016
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to look at students.

699
01:07:49,057 --> 01:07:52,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's hard to optimize routes when you're also dealing with overcrowding.

700
01:07:52,621 --> 01:07:55,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Because obviously we can't go over for the little guys, we can't go over 77.

701
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:04,482
[SPEAKER_17]: which is a full bus, that's all the little ones three per seat, almost impossible because you'll get like home in all different shapes and sizes.

702
01:08:04,662 --> 01:08:06,083
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's very difficult.

703
01:08:06,843 --> 01:08:13,265
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's why we're always trying to do headcounts just to update and see if we can take off dead stops and stuff like that.

704
01:08:13,285 --> 01:08:21,848
[SPEAKER_17]: That is part of our normal protocol to be able to make sure buses, you know, we don't want buses going to stops that aren't there, you know, just because it's on the list.

705
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:31,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my last question, we have had multiple incidents where students have been let off the bus in the wrong place this year.

706
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:40,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And I fielded a call from a parent who was pretty distraught about that on a recent Friday evening.

707
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:46,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm just curious from your standpoint, like, is there something we're doing in Medford that is exacerbating

708
01:08:47,412 --> 01:08:51,415
[SPEAKER_05]: This situation where five year olds get off the bus and cross the square by themselves.

709
01:08:51,935 --> 01:08:57,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something we could be doing differently to assist your drivers like what how do we make sure five year olds are not.

710
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:02,215
[SPEAKER_05]: traversing the square by themselves because they got off at the wrong stop.

711
01:09:03,216 --> 01:09:06,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, I actually know exactly what, that's from the Roberts.

712
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:17,045
[SPEAKER_07]: We pulled a video, we have camera inside and out, and I sent it over to Megan and Michael from the Roberts, and that wasn't the case.

713
01:09:17,645 --> 01:09:27,472
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a, from the YMCA, there's a staff member that comes out, the child got out, went with the staff member, and then all of a sudden staff member said, hey,

714
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:41,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is the wrong child, it wasn't that you know she just, you know, unfortunately, these, these buses have like 60 kids, and they're all screaming to have a tag but it was at the YMCA when there's a staff member.

715
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: went with the staff member and staff member ended up calling, because it was supposed to be at our child supposed to go to RSK.

716
01:09:49,237 --> 01:09:54,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So the why ended up calling, and then ended up getting back to me and I'm like, we pulled the video and that wasn't the case.

717
01:09:55,143 --> 01:09:59,726
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, otherwise, if they're second grade and under, they need to have a tag.

718
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:01,915
[SPEAKER_07]: They all have these tags.

719
01:10:02,015 --> 01:10:03,856
[SPEAKER_07]: My drivers know that they need to be looking.

720
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:08,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, I was on a run this afternoon, and I'm like, wait a second, there's a tag, where's your parent?

721
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking out for where the parent is with the tag.

722
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:15,944
[SPEAKER_07]: If the child doesn't have a tag, that's where there's a problem.

723
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:24,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what can we do in Medford to make this easier on your drivers because

724
01:10:24,918 --> 01:10:26,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel for them.

725
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:31,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought 63 was the number, so I'm a little blown away that it's 77.

726
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:40,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, it's a really hard job for them to keep control of the bus, to keep all the things from going right on the bus.

727
01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:45,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just curious from your standpoint, what should we be doing that would help the situation?

728
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:50,248
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing that would help the situation is do what Cambridge does.

729
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,949
[SPEAKER_13]: They have monitors on every bus.

730
01:10:53,388 --> 01:11:04,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, they're more responsible to controlling the kids and checking the kids and the drivers more driving and not having, you know, to do all that looking back and everything else.

731
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,844
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, it's a huge number to try and do that.

732
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:12,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Cambridge pay for those monitors?

733
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Cambridge pays for the monitors.

734
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been there 40 years, always have.

735
01:11:18,466 --> 01:11:19,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially PMs.

736
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:26,090
[SPEAKER_13]: The AMs, they don't care about, but the PMs is what they make sure we have for every bus.

737
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,212
[SPEAKER_13]: We probably did half and half before the pandemic.

738
01:11:29,232 --> 01:11:33,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Half in the morning, 20 of them, and then 40 in the afternoon.

739
01:11:34,014 --> 01:11:35,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we do 40 all day.

740
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,977
[SPEAKER_13]: But they always made sure it was afternoon monitors, because that's where all the work is.

741
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:42,218
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing in the morning.

742
01:11:42,915 --> 01:11:48,641
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, really, other than making sure the kids are behaving, not so much where the kids are or where they're getting off.

743
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,923
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's, that's right.

744
01:11:49,943 --> 01:11:50,643
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all going to school.

745
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:51,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

746
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:51,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

747
01:11:52,165 --> 01:11:58,472
[SPEAKER_17]: So the afternoon is when, when we do that, because that's obviously a big endeavor to try to do something like that today.

748
01:11:58,632 --> 01:12:04,178
[SPEAKER_17]: It's making sure the staff members are putting the children on the correct bus one.

749
01:12:04,898 --> 01:12:07,140
[SPEAKER_17]: you'd be surprised at how often kids get on the wrong bus.

750
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And two, that the second grade and younger have tags.

751
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:11,843
[SPEAKER_17]: This has been an issue in the past.

752
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:15,465
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just Medford, but I'd be lying if I said it hasn't happened here.

753
01:12:16,126 --> 01:12:18,527
[SPEAKER_17]: So tags are very important in making sure kids run.

754
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:23,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if the kid gets on the wrong bus, we're setting up the driver to fail right off the top.

755
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:26,112
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you said, it's not easy.

756
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:27,994
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're rerouting to go back.

757
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:29,555
[SPEAKER_17]: That bus is even late.

758
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:30,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

759
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:45,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say the last thing about that is that if there are new students that are getting on the bus, and it happens all the time, or going to a different bus for something, then they really should come out and tell the driver.

760
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:51,634
[SPEAKER_13]: They should let the driver know, give him a note, and say to him, you have a new student.

761
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:52,915
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where they're going.

762
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:56,217
[SPEAKER_13]: You should keep them up front.

763
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:59,860
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't know how well that works to do that.

764
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: appreciate that.

765
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

766
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think my request to the superintendent is that the principals be asked to make sure that kids are all tagged, that there is some sort of protocol for what happens when a new student gets on the bus so that we're in communication with the bus driver as as that's happening.

767
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:27,261
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like I've seen that happen before when I've been in sort of bus area.

768
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:32,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to make sure that it is happening with some consistency, I think would be very helpful.

769
01:13:33,003 --> 01:13:38,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And to try to lighten the load from a bus driver perspective.

770
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:43,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And then your point about bus monitors, we've been asked that question many times.

771
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's a very expensive endeavor.

772
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:50,879
[SPEAKER_05]: and perhaps there's some relief coming on that too.

773
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:53,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned for more.

774
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for being here.

775
01:13:56,122 --> 01:13:56,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

776
01:13:56,442 --> 01:14:00,464
[SPEAKER_09]: One more member has questions and then I think we're gonna wrap up.

777
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld.

778
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:06,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here.

779
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:16,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about expanding the pool of drivers or what is the main impediment there?

780
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it salary?

781
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:19,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the timing?

782
01:14:19,332 --> 01:14:20,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just a fixed thing?

783
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:34,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I'm asking is as we look to plan for the next few years, what are some things that we maybe could expect in order to get the pool of people we needed?

784
01:14:34,043 --> 01:14:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think member Graham's questions around how we can support the people who are already there

785
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:47,213
[SPEAKER_04]: are really key, but looking at expanding the pool, like once people are in as drivers, do they stay or are we losing people partway through the year?

786
01:14:47,753 --> 01:14:51,654
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do to make sure we have more people?

787
01:14:51,894 --> 01:14:52,674
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to say.

788
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:57,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I had drivers that I started with and I started the company and they've been with me forever.

789
01:14:58,016 --> 01:15:03,958
[SPEAKER_13]: But since, and I want to say it, since the pandemic, it's a different group.

790
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:09,675
[SPEAKER_13]: of people were saying, we always lost a few, but now, you know, it's just a whole different thing.

791
01:15:09,775 --> 01:15:13,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody got paid for nothing for six, eight months.

792
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:19,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody's offering basically the same money.

793
01:15:19,622 --> 01:15:22,824
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we have to pay them a certain rate.

794
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:24,045
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not cheap.

795
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:24,826
[SPEAKER_13]: $34.25 is the current rate.

796
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

797
01:15:25,366 --> 01:15:27,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And would we be looking at that going up in the future?

798
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:29,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go up every year.

799
01:15:29,288 --> 01:15:29,969
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to go up.

800
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:30,629
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that.

801
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,751
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the newest buses in the system.

802
01:15:33,932 --> 01:15:35,112
[SPEAKER_13]: We pay better.

803
01:15:35,152 --> 01:15:36,273
[SPEAKER_13]: We pay more hours.

804
01:15:36,313 --> 01:15:38,435
[SPEAKER_13]: We do everything we can to keep our drivers.

805
01:15:39,015 --> 01:15:41,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of my drivers come word a month.

806
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:42,677
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always friends.

807
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:43,778
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always family.

808
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:45,499
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always people they met.

809
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,241
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter what it is.

810
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:49,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to keep them there.

811
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:51,876
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard to say.

812
01:15:52,056 --> 01:15:53,757
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very difficult to say.

813
01:15:54,077 --> 01:15:56,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know what's gonna happen.

814
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:01,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, right after the pandemic, I had a lot of older drivers we lost.

815
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:05,886
[SPEAKER_13]: In the past three years, we've probably lost 12 drivers that have passed away.

816
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:12,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a big number, because a lot of these guys weren't old.

817
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:15,072
[SPEAKER_13]: They were between 55 and 60.

818
01:16:15,953 --> 01:16:17,434
[SPEAKER_13]: We just lost another one last week.

819
01:16:18,557 --> 01:16:20,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, it's just there's nothing we can do.

820
01:16:21,019 --> 01:16:33,467
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy's been driving with us a few years and he came in just before the first of the year and said, I've been, you know, they discovered I had, you know, leukemia.

821
01:16:34,747 --> 01:16:35,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Six weeks he was gone.

822
01:16:35,728 --> 01:16:36,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my gosh.

823
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:38,590
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, but nothing you can do.

824
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:43,153
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had guys, you know, 55 year old guy have a heart attack, you know, and he was gone.

825
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,615
[SPEAKER_13]: It just is nothing you can do to change any of that.

826
01:16:47,506 --> 01:16:49,167
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we do whatever we can.

827
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:51,189
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a strong group of people.

828
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:57,414
[SPEAKER_13]: My company is by far better than any company in the state with drivers.

829
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:02,317
[SPEAKER_13]: NRT, just alone, at Framingham, they're short 30 drivers.

830
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:04,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Burlington, they're short five.

831
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:07,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, they're short tons of people.

832
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:08,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody is.

833
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's struggling with it.

834
01:17:10,023 --> 01:17:11,484
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I say, we bring them in.

835
01:17:12,325 --> 01:17:13,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully we can keep them.

836
01:17:14,113 --> 01:17:16,154
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we do everything we can for them.

837
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:19,575
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not even going to Boston like they were.

838
01:17:19,775 --> 01:17:23,696
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to, because of the benefits, everybody used to go to Boston.

839
01:17:23,956 --> 01:17:26,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Once they got our license and worked a couple years, they could go to Boston.

840
01:17:27,157 --> 01:17:30,418
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not doing that because the money's the same and the kids are tough.

841
01:17:31,843 --> 01:17:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if we shifted school days, that's not going to make a difference.

842
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I live right in Medford Square.

843
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:42,256
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been trying lots of different avenues.

844
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:45,921
[SPEAKER_17]: We really developed this program, this training program.

845
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:52,376
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's increased every year as Chuck and I have seen the decrease in the workforce.

846
01:17:52,797 --> 01:17:53,957
[SPEAKER_17]: That's our biggest issue.

847
01:17:54,638 --> 01:17:57,099
[SPEAKER_17]: And not everyone wants to be a school bus driver.

848
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,602
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a lot of patience with a lot of children, but it can create a good opportunity.

849
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:05,084
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've tried, we're above prevailing wage.

850
01:18:05,424 --> 01:18:08,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Our rates are above what the attorney general requires for the city of Method.

851
01:18:10,507 --> 01:18:13,589
[SPEAKER_17]: We've increased our benefits, but in the end,

852
01:18:14,309 --> 01:18:16,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of these drivers, they don't want to work over the summer.

853
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:19,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them are not from this country.

854
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,694
[SPEAKER_17]: So some of them have family in other places.

855
01:18:21,715 --> 01:18:24,597
[SPEAKER_17]: They like to go away for the summer and they just don't come back sometimes.

856
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:29,880
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very difficult, but we have invested a lot of resources to fix this problem.

857
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:39,748
[SPEAKER_17]: We're optimistic come spring, we are going to be turning over a new leaf and with what might come out with this new contract through the,

858
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:44,429
[SPEAKER_17]: purchasing department for Medford, we're optimistic we will be in good standing.

859
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:46,410
[SPEAKER_17]: But the summer is a curveball.

860
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:47,390
[SPEAKER_17]: We just never know.

861
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:47,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

862
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:52,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

863
01:18:52,893 --> 01:18:54,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we do, can I say one more thing quick?

864
01:18:55,814 --> 01:19:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to put a big thank you to to say that Chuck is right about the communication.

865
01:19:01,817 --> 01:19:05,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give Jessica a huge round of applause and thank you publicly here, Jessica.

866
01:19:06,138 --> 01:19:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been terrific with communicating with me and with the schools as fast as you can.

867
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:14,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got everybody on like speed dial and speed text.

868
01:19:14,665 --> 01:19:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been wonderful from my perspective, as far as getting us the information as fast as you can so that we can get it out to families as fast as we can.

869
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:29,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's an ever improving process that we've got about how to inform families about up to the minute

870
01:19:30,086 --> 01:19:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: things that they need to know about the buses, but I just wanted to say it has been great whenever you can give us an early bus.

871
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:46,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate the timely and quick and short communication and the long phone calls that we've also had into the night trying to be like, what can we do differently?

872
01:19:46,135 --> 01:19:55,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, I feel affirmed a lot of what was said tonight is what we've gone over a couple of times in our several times a month check-ins.

873
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really appreciate all of your help in partnership with this.

874
01:20:00,022 --> 01:20:00,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

875
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

876
01:20:01,603 --> 01:20:02,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Megan.

877
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley.

878
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:03,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a couple of points.

879
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Jessica, yes, I was gonna just say thank you for all that you do.

880
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:13,547
[SPEAKER_08]: In Somerville, I work side by side with the Somerville Special Education Transportation Department, and the transportation calls never end.

881
01:20:14,467 --> 01:20:16,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's all year round.

882
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:17,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have extended school year.

883
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:19,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another whole project in itself.

884
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:30,379
[SPEAKER_08]: field trips, day-to-day, it never ends, detours, road closures, unexpected things, a car accident, changes a whole route for a bus.

885
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:34,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want you to know that I do appreciate everything that you do.

886
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I obviously don't work hand-in-hand with you here at Medford.

887
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:45,166
[SPEAKER_08]: But just another point, with the kids getting on the buses, I worked in the kindergarten classroom for six years at the Brooks.

888
01:20:47,607 --> 01:20:48,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Dismissal is chaos.

889
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:50,680
[SPEAKER_08]: especially in the kindergarten.

890
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Five-year-olds don't always know where they're going.

891
01:20:52,941 --> 01:20:54,761
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know what day it is all the time.

892
01:20:57,442 --> 01:21:00,383
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to say, give the bus driver a note.

893
01:21:00,883 --> 01:21:01,543
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

894
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:09,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the day-to-day in the classroom, I just can see how that could just be nearly impossible at times.

895
01:21:10,186 --> 01:21:17,728
[SPEAKER_08]: A child goes up to the bus at one time, one week with two aides and maybe a teacher.

896
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:25,214
[SPEAKER_08]: they get up to the gym and then it's you're off to your bus line.

897
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Those people change constantly.

898
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Different staff covered different weeks.

899
01:21:32,497 --> 01:21:40,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know how to really make it as smooth as I would love to see it, or as you would love to see it, or the bus driver would love to see it.

900
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:46,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I give all the kudos to the bus drivers because I've been on plenty of field trips for my own children.

901
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be a bus driver.

902
01:21:50,941 --> 01:21:59,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So I big huge kudos to the bus drivers also because they are really the ones on the ground doing all the work, you know, day in and day out with.

903
01:22:00,183 --> 01:22:11,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all you know anybody that has children know the chaos of having your own children in the car asking for something when you have one or two children that are asking a question, let alone 60 or 70 kids that

904
01:22:15,089 --> 01:22:16,951
[SPEAKER_08]: is beyond imagination to me.

905
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,375
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really think it's great that everybody has their tags.

906
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:23,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I was the one that put the tags on the kids in the kindergarten.

907
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:26,639
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great system, but those tags fall off.

908
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:28,141
[SPEAKER_08]: You forget your backpack one day.

909
01:22:28,161 --> 01:22:30,983
[SPEAKER_08]: A million things can happen.

910
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know how we really make this like the smoothest process.

911
01:22:34,346 --> 01:22:36,128
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, I know our staff

912
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,620
[SPEAKER_08]: would do anything, you know what I mean?

913
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously to ensure that the kids are getting in the right place and so are you.

914
01:22:41,141 --> 01:22:45,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So a big, huge kudos to everybody that's working this constantly.

915
01:22:45,903 --> 01:22:46,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

916
01:22:48,223 --> 01:22:54,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you so much for coming tonight and answering some of our questions and trying to train as many bus drivers as you can.

917
01:22:54,185 --> 01:22:55,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we can get another one or two.

918
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:56,846
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

919
01:22:56,946 --> 01:22:58,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you very much.

920
01:22:58,426 --> 01:22:58,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

921
01:22:58,746 --> 01:22:59,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

956
01:25:03,757 --> 01:25:07,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also have a regular scheduled meeting.

957
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:15,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next one will be on November 4th, 2024, held remotely, only to accommodate the election process.

958
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:16,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the two upcoming meetings.

959
01:25:17,143 --> 01:25:18,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to adjourn?
