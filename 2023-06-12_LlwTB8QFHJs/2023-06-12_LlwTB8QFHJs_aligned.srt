1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:01,192
I'm Justin Tseng.

2
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:05,176
For the last two years, I've been proud to be your voice on the Medford City Council.

3
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:08,158
Now, I'm running for re-election to keep Medford moving forward.

4
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,300
Let's build a future that leaves no one behind.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,465
The challenges my family faced while I was growing up in Medford motivated me to hit the ground running.

6
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:21,407
And in just two years, we've made real progress in making our city more affordable, accessible, and welcoming for all.

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,887
We've created an affordable housing trust and passed a housing production plan.

8
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,128
We're upgrading our green space and cutting pollution.

9
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:34,350
I'm proud to have fought for and won more money for our schools and library, keeping bus routes in Medford, and protecting our immigrant and LGBTQ plus neighbors.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,751
Our city is finally moving again, but our work here isn't done.

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,612
Let's turn these moments of progress into momentum for the future.

12
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,834
Let's think bigger and act bolder to tackle the housing crisis.

13
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:50,196
Let's implement the ambitious climate agenda we started this term and let's revitalize our local economy.

14
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:55,599
From fixing our roads and sidewalks to creating more after-school child care and tackling systemic injustice.

15
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,060
We have more work to do.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,382
We need someone in the room who will bring our conversations back to what fundamentally matters.

17
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,184
How do we stop folks from being priced out and left behind?

18
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,646
How do we make our city cleaner and our schools better?

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:12,029
How can we make our residents, no matter where they were born or how they identify, feel safe and welcome in our city?

20
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,471
As your counselor, I'm proud to be that voice.

21
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:20,815
Together, we've brought more housing, more jobs, a more vibrant scene, better parks, and better bus service back to Medford.

22
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:22,656
But there's still so much left to do.

23
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:24,517
Let's keep Medford moving forward.

24
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:28,465
and build a city that works for you, me, and our neighbors down the street.
