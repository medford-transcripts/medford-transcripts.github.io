1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:01,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Justin Tseng.

2
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:05,176
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last two years, I've been proud to be your voice on the Medford City Council.

3
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:08,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm running for re-election to keep Medford moving forward.

4
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build a future that leaves no one behind.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,465
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenges my family faced while I was growing up in Medford motivated me to hit the ground running.

6
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:21,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And in just two years, we've made real progress in making our city more affordable, accessible, and welcoming for all.

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We've created an affordable housing trust and passed a housing production plan.

8
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,128
[SPEAKER_00]: We're upgrading our green space and cutting pollution.

9
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:34,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to have fought for and won more money for our schools and library, keeping bus routes in Medford, and protecting our immigrant and LGBTQ plus neighbors.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Our city is finally moving again, but our work here isn't done.

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn these moments of progress into momentum for the future.

12
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think bigger and act bolder to tackle the housing crisis.

13
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:50,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's implement the ambitious climate agenda we started this term and let's revitalize our local economy.

14
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:55,599
[SPEAKER_00]: From fixing our roads and sidewalks to creating more after-school child care and tackling systemic injustice.

15
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more work to do.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,382
[SPEAKER_00]: We need someone in the room who will bring our conversations back to what fundamentally matters.

17
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,184
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we stop folks from being priced out and left behind?

18
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,646
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make our city cleaner and our schools better?

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:12,029
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make our residents, no matter where they were born or how they identify, feel safe and welcome in our city?

20
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,471
[SPEAKER_00]: As your counselor, I'm proud to be that voice.

21
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:20,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, we've brought more housing, more jobs, a more vibrant scene, better parks, and better bus service back to Medford.

22
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:22,656
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still so much left to do.

23
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:24,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep Medford moving forward.

24
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:28,465
[SPEAKER_00]: and build a city that works for you, me, and our neighbors down the street.
