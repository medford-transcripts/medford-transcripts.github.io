[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get in, we're going to talk mostly I think about West Medford Open Studios today.

37
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get into that, I'll start with the question that I ask everyone on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

38
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you like to eat there?

39
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:36,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

40
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,571
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite topic, food.

41
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:48,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we, I would say, you know, we have a bunch of favorites, but we love pikaichi ramen.

42
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of our, you know, kind of

43
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,736
[SPEAKER_04]: every other week favorite.

44
00:02:54,157 --> 00:03:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Emilino's is awesome and love Goldilocks bagels like those are our favorite kind of takeout take home so that's it for me.

45
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

46
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:12,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah so I was thinking about it and so our all-time favorite restaurant

47
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,393
[SPEAKER_08]: closed, which was Emiliana's, which we grew up taking.

48
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I took all my kids there.

49
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, it's four blocks away.

50
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had all our birthdays there.

51
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:26,297
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a family-owned and operated Mexican restaurant.

52
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,939
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we go mostly to Canote, which we love.

53
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's our new favorite.

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird picks, yeah.

55
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some popular ones.

56
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't heard about that one that closed though, so thanks for sharing that.

57
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:41,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.

58
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:49,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping we could talk more about West Medford Open Studios and Tanya, it sounds like you've, um, you've been around the West Medford Open Studios since the beginning.

59
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping you could tell us a little bit about the history.

60
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:52,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

61
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:53,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

62
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:09,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so West Medford Open Studios was sort of, so my husband and I, um, prior to West Medford Open Studios had been, you know, he was doing pottery and I'm doing photography.

63
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:15,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had like a group of friends, most of them were from not from Medford.

64
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:21,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would just kind of do pop ups, where I don't think we call them pop ups.

65
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:25,388
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what they were back in the day, prior to 1999.

66
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So quite a while ago.

67
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:29,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And then

68
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:39,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as we kind of got to know some new neighbors that we realized were artists, we realized there were a lot of artists just right around us.

69
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And so over the fence, our neighbor Marilyn is a painter.

70
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to know her friend, Mary Lou, a photographer, and several West Medford artists that we knew, including Maureen Thawney.

71
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was one of the founders too.

72
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:58,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would just start chatting like over the fences, like gathering.

73
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, Hey, like we heard about this kind of newish thing, like an open studios event, you know, it'd be cool to have one here.

74
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:09,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's really how it started.

75
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably fall of 1999 or summer, fall of 1999.

76
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:16,683
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, yeah, we should do it.

77
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:17,464
[SPEAKER_04]: This was cool.

78
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:17,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's.

79
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:28,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, talk to a few more friends that we know that we got a small group together, um, and just started meeting to talk about how we could do it.

80
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:37,766
[SPEAKER_04]: One of, you know, like one of the friends was Anita Tucker, and she lives in West Medford.

81
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:46,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And she kind of just wanted to help organize it, not as an artist, but just, you know, a neighbor, kind of that wanted to be helpful.

82
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just started having meetings at people's houses, you know, a little grassroots thing.

83
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and figured out how to organize it.

84
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:57,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all just

85
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:02,770
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteer, whoever wanted to do it, whatever jobs we were kind of good at.

86
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we, someone did reach out to someone from Somerville Open Studios that had started maybe a year or two before us.

87
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and they were very helpful and shared information.

88
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:18,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's basically how we got started.

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the winter of 2000, I guess we decided like, yeah, we're going to do this.

90
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

91
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It was small.

92
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:31,388
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one we had, uh, I wrote it down.

93
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: We had 13 sites.

94
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and the other thing is the, the structure of open studio, that's really like, uh, use your home studio, community spaces, and you have like a map and, and people from the community just walk around in wherever, or get, get to the different artists faces and view the art.

95
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like,

96
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:13,768
[SPEAKER_04]: a neighborhood community event that brings the community to artist spaces or we have artists host other artists, you know, and it wasn't, we weren't trying to make it exclusive to only West Medford artists, but we wanted to focus on a small enough area.

97
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seemed manageable as well.

98
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really, that's the beginning of what we did.

99
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it's,

100
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,920
[SPEAKER_04]: grown and grown and grown.

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, the structure has stayed the same until COVID.

102
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, that's a another topic.

103
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:41,446
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, basically, we we've been in people's homes and studio spaces.

104
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And like we've used the West Medford Community Center since

105
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:53,156
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first year, I looked at the first year map and they were one of our spaces, which, you know, they've been a partner, great partner through the years.

106
00:07:54,476 --> 00:08:02,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also used the Brooks School, I think most of the years, but maybe not the very beginning.

107
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:12,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, as I said, the first year we had 13 sites and 24 artists, and it has grown substantially since then.

108
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:18,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I look forward to hearing what you have to say about the changes in COVID and that's interesting to know.

109
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:25,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was like, I don't know what I was imagining open studios to be, but it's helpful to hear that it's kind of like seeing some artists maybe like in their own space.

110
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:31,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some, I was imagining more of like a, like a craft fair sort of farmers market setup, but it is sort of.

111
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:43,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Brook School, when it, there were sites at the Brook School and that had more of a craft fair feel, like there were, there are tables in one big like cafeteria space and all the artists would set up at their table.

112
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:51,268
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was still fine art, like, you know, woodturners and potters and things, but they, that was more like what you're thinking, like a traditional art fair.

113
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:57,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was right from the beginning, I guess it was like half open studios and half more traditional art fair.

114
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I would say.

115
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,501
[SPEAKER_04]: we had, because we only had 13 sites.

116
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:06,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were just mostly all at people's homes.

117
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:14,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just the community center was like the one location that we were able to have a few more artists in one space.

118
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:24,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, but we just made it work, you know, because part of it is like, if you don't have enough

119
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:30,729
[SPEAKER_04]: of artists in the community, we have to ask for hosts, ask people to host their homes.

120
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is something that grew as well through the years.

121
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was good too.

122
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a way for artists to get to know the people in the community.

123
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:50,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So non-artists would open their homes up and people would walk around and see who had art studios and meet their neighbors who were hosting artists.

124
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel like it was a really good way to get to know

125
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: your neighbors.

126
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.

127
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna say, Tanya, the way you described it is kind of felt like, you know, you and your husband are artists, you kind of connected with other artists that you didn't even maybe know necessarily were in your neighborhood, and then kind of went from there.

128
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:17,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I wonder what your hope was, in starting something like this, like what you had maybe as a hope for the impact on the community and impact on the artists in West Medford.

129
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was definitely to, you know, kind of

130
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:28,944
[SPEAKER_04]: expose our neighbors and friends to the art.

131
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:33,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We realized there were so many artists in the community and

132
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to like share it with people and share, you know, and let have opportunities for artists in the community.

133
00:10:42,013 --> 00:11:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said, not just from West Medford, but from all of Medford and even surrounding communities, like we always invite whoever, but just an opportunity for people to share their art and, you know, it's emerging artists and, you know, more experienced artists and just kind of create like,

134
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,456
[SPEAKER_04]: a nice cultural vibe and, you know, a sharing experience of art.

135
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:14,477
Yeah.

136
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:15,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephanie, would you add anything?

137
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:23,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I think coming on a few years later, would you add anything about sort of like your choice to be involved or kind of your hopes for being involved with the open studio?

138
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:27,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just love the idea of that.

139
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:43,510
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have been living here for probably eight or ten years before I got involved with maybe a little less than that before I got involved with open studios, but it was just so much fun to walk around the neighborhood and you might like see people going in and out of their houses like

140
00:11:44,310 --> 00:12:06,482
[SPEAKER_08]: during the course of the year but you didn't talk to them or you didn't know them and and then you would go into their house and they'd be like oh yes well here's my like whole art studio in the backyard where I make these gorgeous oil paintings or this amazing pottery or you know oh by the way I'm a musician on the weekends and you had like no idea and there are so many of them in our in West Medford like in our little neighborhood so

141
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:34,936
[SPEAKER_08]: it was such a surprise and a treat to walk around and be like I had no idea you did this like you know you talk to them on and off on their porch or whatever but then you go into your house and you're like this is crazy like so many interesting people and so many cool artists and it's so much fun and when people move into the area and they go to open studios and then you talk to them they're like oh I'm a potter and then they show you a picture of their like basement which is like a full-on pottery studio like um so it's just

142
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:43,239
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a great way to get to know people like that because we tend to all be, you know, like you don't, that's not like maybe the first thing you say to somebody when you meet them.

143
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a good way.

144
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:45,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know?

145
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

146
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also going to add that.

147
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:53,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So through the years, and I'm not sure what year.

148
00:12:53,698 --> 00:13:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been maybe the second or third year that we added one of our neighbors, David Shaw was a writer, and he wanted to organize, like having local writers doing readings as part of Open Studio.

149
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So like that piece got added on.

150
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:21,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also, I don't even know what year we started having musicians, but we have music as part of it.

151
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:32,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's evolved in a way from just visual art, you know, to like all art, which is, I love about open studios as well.

152
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had moving screenings when we were at the Brooks Center.

153
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

154
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:45,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And this year we're going to have Monique and Clay's film, two showings at the community center.

155
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:48,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a little film and everything.

156
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And every year it's been different.

157
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, some years we have more performances.

158
00:13:54,598 --> 00:14:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had the Irish Step Dance Company from West Medford perform, um, when, when we were, we used the church across the street, um, from the Brooks School a couple of years.

159
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:12,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we had tons of performances and they're all different types of performances.

160
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:18,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really, it's been interesting, like every year it's really like a little bit different.

161
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:23,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had a favorite moment in the open studios or sort of like highlights that you'd share?

162
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, let's see.

163
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we were able to

164
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:56,587
[SPEAKER_04]: know pre-COVID at our have it at our home like we so my husband will bring out the pottery wheel into the driveway and he on a couple of the day a couple of time slots he would do um just throwing in the driveway and people love to see that and it's just it's pretty cool you know because

165
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:02,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if there's a lot of people that love pottery, but they don't really get to see how it's made.

166
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really like a beautiful process to see.

167
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:11,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And he makes it look pretty easy too, but it's great.

168
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:16,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And like occasionally he's like, let someone else try it and kind of give a little lesson.

169
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:20,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know over the years, I love, and we've had other demos.

170
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, as a personal chef.

171
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:25,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done demos in the kitchen at Jerome Street Studio.

172
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:32,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do like kind of like half hour demos on some thing of cooking that I want to share.

173
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:45,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like those moments were great for me because I really got to interact with people coming through and asking questions and seeing what I do as well.

174
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and celebrating big moments.

175
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,489
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2019, we had our 20th year.

176
00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:02,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was also our last time when we had it at people's homes and studios.

177
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So the 20th year was pretty special.

178
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We had like over 100 artists, too.

179
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:07,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

180
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:08,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot.

181
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:22,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like a demonstration that sounds like a really powerful way to share something that you are so passionate about and really be able to see the process and have people witness that.

182
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:28,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can imagine for even people that maybe don't already have an interest in art, that being pretty captivating.

183
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

184
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:30,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes people happy.

185
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a happy weekend.

186
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,157
[SPEAKER_04]: People come around, they're like, oh, this is what you do.

187
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:39,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We always hosted.

188
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,285
[SPEAKER_04]: probably like four or five artists, because we had it in our barn garage.

189
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a lot of space to host other people and just seeing people interact with the other artists that we host, that's really cool.

190
00:16:54,553 --> 00:17:06,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just, it really, it's a joyous weekend, I think, you know, people really, people from the community get very excited about it.

191
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Stephanie?

192
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Any highlights for you?

193
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:20,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I was, I was thinking while Tanya was talking, but I think the most amazing thing that I experienced was, so we had the 2020

194
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Open Studios was canceled because of COVID, we had it all online.

195
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:33,419
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then I guess 2021, we were able to have it down at Duggar Park.

196
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:37,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And so everybody had been in COVID for like a year.

197
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like the brief window where everything kind of opened up again.

198
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:43,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And we weren't sure until the last minute if we were going to be able to pull it off.

199
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:47,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was all new, and it was outside, and there were like a whole bunch of artists involved.

200
00:17:47,964 --> 00:18:08,945
[SPEAKER_08]: we had it and people so many people came so many people it was packed and everybody had this like kind of glazed happy look like they couldn't believe they were out and talking to people and seeing art and everyone was like this is the greatest thing I've ever that's like ever happened like people were so happy to be there and we had um

201
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:11,475
[SPEAKER_08]: What did we have a food tent?

202
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:12,796
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we had music though.

203
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:13,776
[SPEAKER_08]: We had live music.

204
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,497
[SPEAKER_08]: We had music and the readings.

205
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:16,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And the readings.

206
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:23,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just, it was such an exciting, and people from the neighborhood were like, we've never come to this before.

207
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:25,119
[SPEAKER_08]: We had no idea this was happening.

208
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And people were like wandering in, like didn't even know what was going on.

209
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And it felt like it was an amazing experience.

210
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's my favorite memory.

211
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:35,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

212
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:36,811
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're right.

213
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,472
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.

214
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:40,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty amazing.

215
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:41,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

216
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:43,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you've been... Sorry.

217
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:44,153
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go ahead.

218
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:44,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

219
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:53,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It just felt like such an accomplishment to be able to have it, to host it, you know, after having gone through COVID.

220
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:58,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had to really brainstorm, like, are we going to be able to do this?

221
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:04,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it was waiting till the last minute almost because, you know, things were changing.

222
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know what the regulations and rules would be.

223
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:13,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had to also think about, like, making sure there was enough room between the tents.

224
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:29,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like a little bit smaller event, but, you know, we, like, measured out between the tents, made sure the aisles were, you know, so it was like a lot of work on our part, but it was just, when it happened, it was really, it was really amazing, it was definitely so.

225
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like you had a couple of different ways of adapting to the various stages and phases of COVID.

226
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this year's event going to look like?

227
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:44,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So this year, we are having it down at Duggar Park.

228
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year since, like, for post-COVID, we've had to, like, in our meeting, planning meeting, we're like, OK, like, how can we do this?

229
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,728
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't seem like we can go back to the old way yet.

230
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not quite sure.

231
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So we keep, this is now going to be our third time.

232
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:09,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct stuff?

233
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Our third time at Duggar Park.

234
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we use the community center, West Medford Community Center.

235
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like, as I said, they're right across the street.

236
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:24,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have some artists within the West Medford Community Center.

237
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: But mostly it's

238
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,837
[SPEAKER_04]: it's on the field in at Duggar Park.

239
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have so all the artists are under 10.

240
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe we have 71 artists this year.

241
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's less than last year, more than 2020.

242
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:45,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sort of like a happy medium.

243
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be having music performances.

244
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,505
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the writers as well.

245
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:56,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And this year we're having, well, I guess last year we also had like food trucks.

246
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:59,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Gouldy Lock Bagels doing a pop-up.

247
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the Medford Brewing Beer Tent.

248
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And what am I missing?

249
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the... Bon Me food truck.

250
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:09,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bon Me.

251
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be down there.

252
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, we're excited.

253
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:17,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think it's, we have a few.

254
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We also like to involve the

255
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:24,633
[SPEAKER_04]: high school, um, any art programs of the high school.

256
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:28,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the, uh, ceramics club at the high school.

257
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:29,555
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a table.

258
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:39,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, also the, how do you fabrication metal welding and fabrication, the Vogue with, um, Curtis Jackson, right?

259
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:40,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

260
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And he, he'll, they're going to have like some sort of installation of things they've worked on over the year.

261
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

262
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And mass art.

263
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, one of our board members, John and Tapa,

264
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:59,276
[SPEAKER_04]: is graduating from math art, but we're hosting a table for math art students through him.

265
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:05,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, I don't know, I'm excited for this year.

266
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a little bit different than last year and the year before.

267
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:19,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, when you talked about the first year, you said about 24 artists, and now you're saying over 70 down from more last year.

268
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:29,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like when something starts at such a grassroots level, and then I know the hope, it sounds like, is to become bigger and more integrated in the community and getting more people there.

269
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,165
[SPEAKER_02]: What challenges have come with that?

270
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:36,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

271
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:40,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, along the way, definitely,

272
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:51,218
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as you grow, you have to find like, how to fund it, you know, that's always been a thing for the beginning part, I think it became more obvious.

273
00:22:52,339 --> 00:23:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget which year, but we we did create like an official nonprofit for open for West Medford Open Studios.

274
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:07,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, it was easier to find sources of funding.

275
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:08,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get grants from

276
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:13,721
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Cultural Council or the Mass Cultural Council, we've applied.

277
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten other grants along the way.

278
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten some funding from Tufts over the years, and even from private donations.

279
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:36,049
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like in the beginning, that was definitely like, okay, like we can all chip in, you know, but then at some point, you're like, well, we should maybe find other ways that we're not just chipping in.

280
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But so that's one thing in starting a grassroots.

281
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's worked itself out.

282
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Steph, do you have?

283
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So the volunteer.

284
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah volunteers.

285
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:54,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a huge number of volunteers who work closely with Monique Doherty.

286
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:09,527
[SPEAKER_08]: She kind of is the volunteer wrangler and they're there all day long the day of the event and they help with setup and they help artists during the course of the day like if they need a bathroom break or they need water or just to check in because it can be hot in June.

287
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's like like water stations and we check in with the artists and

288
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:24,073
[SPEAKER_08]: They help with takedown and they're just like super and they're usually a mix of high school students and local adults from the area, right?

289
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:25,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

290
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:25,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

291
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:25,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

292
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:26,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

293
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:27,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

294
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:37,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, we wouldn't be able to have an open studios without support from the community, you know, through volunteers, through

295
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, small donations, um, just friends of people telling their friends and neighbors about open studio.

296
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a big, it's a big effort and we don't have a very big board.

297
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:52,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're all volunteer.

298
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all doing tons of other things too.

299
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think like one challenge is just kind of having the energy for us to keep

300
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,283
[SPEAKER_04]: figuring things out, especially post COVID.

301
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:29,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like, it's, there's definitely struggle, or not struggle, but, but challenges from having it at Duggar Park now, it's logistically, there's just wholly different issues than everyone just opening their own space, you know.

302
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:34,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's been a big challenge in the last few years, the logistics of having

303
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:36,995
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody going to one space.

304
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the plus side, people love it, you know, like we've gotten tons of great feedback from people, you know, visitors and artists because everyone kind of gets an equal opportunity to experience open studio at the same time, you know, as opposed to, oh, I have my map, like, where am I going to go?

305
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have two hours and I have to make decisions about where to go.

306
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:02,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

307
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's definitely a plus side and a minus side to changing the way we've done it over the years.

308
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:18,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if folks want to get involved and volunteer, how would they do that?

309
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: On our website, we have a link or a tab for volunteer.

310
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,978
[SPEAKER_04]: But OK, I'll share it.

311
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:30,758
[SPEAKER_04]: The website is wmos.org.

312
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:44,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an Instagram page, which anyone can message if they're interested in or have a question, can message through there.

313
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:52,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's west.medford.open.studio.

314
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also a Facebook page that I believe the same as the Instagram page.

315
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically on the website,

316
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:08,301
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely, I think, volunteer or question tabs that you can send messages.

317
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and we're always looking for volunteers.

318
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go on.

319
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:16,245
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just gonna say, or reach out to anybody on the board.

320
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:22,187
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know somebody on the board, you can contact them and they'll direct you to the right person.

321
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:25,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are definitely always looking for volunteers.

322
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:27,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's fun.

323
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's really,

324
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:33,788
[SPEAKER_04]: People volunteer, you know, like sometimes you can also choose how much you want to volunteer.

325
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:35,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have to do the whole day.

326
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:40,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I know a lot of people that, that get involved and they're like, Oh, that was so fun.

327
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to meet some new people.

328
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:49,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and you know, T-shirt that says, every year, right.

329
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:50,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

330
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:56,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a free T-shirt and you know, it's just, it's nice to sort of, if you're

331
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:10,060
[SPEAKER_04]: new to the community or you just want to do something where you're meeting new people or learn about the arts, you know, it's definitely a good way to learn and get involved.

332
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

333
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I, I have a young kid.

334
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the way that I connect with the community, but also makes me unable to do a lot of these things that I hear about, like volunteering for, but it sounds like.

335
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:30,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I like thinking about all the different ways, any, any different type of persons or somebody without kids, somebody who's kids have, you know, have gotten older, like that they can engage with the community.

336
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes me excited to think like one day I could do that.

337
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.

338
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:36,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

339
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:37,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice.

340
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:41,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one thing that I've noticed over the years, like we have

341
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of some younger people that I've known as kids now participate either as artists, like two of our artists this year are kids that I knew as kids growing up.

342
00:28:56,103 --> 00:29:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're part, you know, they're signed up, they're registered, you know, they're adults, young adults.

343
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:07,066
[SPEAKER_04]: My son and his girlfriend are both on our board now.

344
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is an artist.

345
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:11,327
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a photographer.

346
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:17,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus and his girlfriend, Mary, and they're part of the board now.

347
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:24,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, we have a lot of volunteers that I've known since like, we've known since they were like little kids.

348
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're like, Hey, I'm here to help.

349
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a senior in high school or I'm a freshman in high school.

350
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:35,229
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's lots of different ways, you know, to, to help out or be involved.

351
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:40,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to meet artists, whether you're a visitor or

352
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:42,759
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteer.

353
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, thank you.

354
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And can we say you want to say when the event is happening?

355
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

356
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's June 24.

357
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:58,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And at from 12 to 5pm.

358
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:00,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be at Duggar Park.

359
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And also at the West Medford Community Center, which is on

360
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,143
[SPEAKER_04]: that's Mystic River Road in West Medford.

361
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:13,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a nice location, too.

362
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:15,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to add this because it's right by the river.

363
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a kayak, you want to kayak from Medford Square, kayak on down.

364
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pull your kayak in.

365
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The tennis courts are there and the playground.

366
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:31,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a beautiful area.

367
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You can bring some snacks.

368
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we'll have restrooms and port-a-potties and there's food and, you know, you bring a blanket and just hang out, listen to the music, listen to the writers, walk around.

369
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:54,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really, it's quite a nice place and event.

370
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:57,393
[SPEAKER_04]: to come to, and it's free.

371
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,174
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just show up.

372
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:08,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free on street parking, and it's like six blocks from the commuter rail, and it's about a mile from the red line in Davis.

373
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:12,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's buses, so it's super easy to get to commuting.

374
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:24,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bike path, or the path, you could really walk, because the path goes all the way, I don't know how far it goes, but it at least goes to Medford Square, and it goes

375
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:28,820
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way up to Winchester, right?

376
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:39,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, say if you walked, if you walk, if you follow Duggar, the path that goes along the river, you could really walk to Winchester, right?

377
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

378
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far.

379
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice walk.

380
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that we forgot to mention that you want to share about the event or about anything else?

381
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:58,732
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a great website that actually, Tanya, I wanted to ask you how long the website, when did you guys first have a website?

382
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:00,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

383
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not positive.

384
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think.

385
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had a wonderful community member, Naomi Peer.

386
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:13,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Stringfield.

387
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Stringfield, right.

388
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:18,184
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I paused because she's married.

389
00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:23,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known her as Naomi Pierce for years, but she is Stringfield now.

390
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:40,928
[SPEAKER_04]: She designed the website many years ago, and I actually don't know what year, but she's been involved doing our graphic design and web stuff up until kind of

391
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,552
[SPEAKER_04]: the end of last year.

392
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:56,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's also kind of helping our new web graphics design person, Victoria, just kind of mentoring her in to take over.

393
00:32:57,217 --> 00:33:05,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's a West Medford community member that has been doing it all these years.

394
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:12,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, I don't off the top of my head know when we got the website, but that was a big change, you know?

395
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So like from the beginning, we just kind of had a very simple little pamphlet, like black and white.

396
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can probably print a table and then, you know, over the years it's changed.

397
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we kind of have like a glossy, lots of beautiful color photos and, you know, like a little map of the river and everything.

398
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's definitely evolved and.

399
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:44,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you go on the website, you'll see listings of all the artists and the schedules of the music performances and the writers.

400
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, check out the website.

401
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:48,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Each artist has a page.

402
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:50,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you go to the main page, it lists all the artists.

403
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you click on the artist's photograph, like a piece of their work,

404
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:02,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes you to their page with links and a description of their artist statement and what works they'll, like an example of the works they'll be bringing.

405
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:06,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a good way to, and that should be up about a month before the event.

406
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go in and look and see who's going to be at the event.

407
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:14,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great service for the artists too, getting them on the website and making all that so accessible.

408
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Do artists get involved in the same way as volunteers, like just sort of reaching out to the board or reaching out to the website?

409
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:27,207
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of artists volunteer, you know, to help.

410
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:47,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we try to have an event just for the participating artists about a month before kind of a kickoff event where people get to meet each other and, you know, sort of decide if they want to pick a job, if they want to help volunteer.

411
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We have signs, we have yard signs that will

412
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:55,226
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll put around the city and, you know, at artists' homes if they want to have one in their yard.

413
00:34:56,808 --> 00:35:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there's different ways for the artists themselves to be involved.

414
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:03,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

415
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that we missed?

416
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:08,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

417
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:08,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

418
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:09,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down, though.

419
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a great event this year.

420
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping the weather, you know, is very nice for us.

421
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:17,621
[SPEAKER_08]: The rain date.

422
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rain date is on Sunday.

423
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So the event is Saturday, the 24th.

424
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:28,611
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it looks bad on Saturday, we'll have the rain date on Sunday, the 25th.

425
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Last summer, it was incredibly hot, right?

426
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that?

427
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:36,375
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still fun.

428
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

429
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:38,456
