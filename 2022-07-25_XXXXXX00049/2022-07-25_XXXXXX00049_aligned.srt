1
00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:11,425
Hey Medford Bites listeners, I wanted to give you some updates on proposals being made to address the city budget following the most recent budget session.

2
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:18,748
Two different plans have been proposed, one by Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern and the other by City Councilors Zach Bares and Kit Collins.

3
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:27,671
The Mayor is proposing that the City Council approve a measure to levy taxes that has a cap of $3 million, totaling of about $150 a year for each household.

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:40,406
Councilor Behrs and Councilor Collins have proposed a plan to increase the city budget by overriding Proposition 2.5 to increase revenue in taxes by $12 million.

5
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:44,189
This would break down to about $550 a year or $46 a month for the average single-family household.

6
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:54,788
Under Prop 2.5, property taxes can only increase by 2.5% in one year.

7
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:00,774
Overriding Prop 2.5 would allow property taxes to be set by assessed property values.

8
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:09,643
This increase would only be allowed for a single fiscal year and exemptions can be implemented for those groups that may be most impacted by the change.

9
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:13,747
Both plans are available to read on the Mayor's Facebook page as well as

10
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,168
Councillor Behrs and Councillor Collins social media.

11
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:21,689
I also included a link in the show notes to explain more about how Prop 2.5 works.

12
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,670
Today you'll hear a conversation with members of the Medford Family Network.

13
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,672
Check out the show notes for links to their website and ways to stay connected.

14
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:30,852
I hope you enjoy.

15
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:39,583
All right, thank you both so much for joining me today.

16
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:44,984
If we could start just by introducing ourselves, if you could say your name and your pronouns and just who you are.

17
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,445
It's great to be here, Danielle.

18
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,486
I'm Marie Cassidy, director of the Medford Family Network.

19
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:56,207
Her, she, hers, my pronouns, and just wonderful to have this opportunity to talk with you.

20
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,948
Thank you.

21
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:58,868
I'm Caroline Cohen.

22
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,509
I'm the president of the Friends of the Medford Family Network.

23
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:02,529
My pronouns are

24
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:04,088
she and her.

25
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:11,233
And yeah, thank you so much for doing this for the community and really letting everyone learn more about the great things here in Medford.

26
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,535
Thank you both so much.

27
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:17,458
And I know Caroline, you've listened to the podcast, so you're ready for this next question.

28
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:23,944
So the one that I ask everybody is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

29
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,466
I have hopefully two answers only.

30
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:33,690
I'd say in general my answer to all food questions in Medford is snappy patties.

31
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,252
I feel like you can never go wrong there.

32
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:43,057
I love their patio and it's great for brunch and their chicken, what do they call them now?

33
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:47,118
Their fried chicken is just out of this world.

34
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:53,304
But then a little closer to home, I love Classic Cafe and their breakfast burrito.

35
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:59,950
I pretty much only ordered that for the last five or six years, and I love it.

36
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,591
Delicious.

37
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,933
Classic Cafe isn't one we've heard yet, so thank you.

38
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:03,473
Excellent.

39
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:08,218
I went on memory lane when I heard that question, Danielle.

40
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:15,265
So having been growing up in Medford, my favorite place to be was Carol's Restaurant because it was open 24-7.

41
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,429
So you would go there after an evening out, you'd meet your friends late at night.

42
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,072
It was a wonderful place to be in Medford.

43
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:25,815
I don't know what they served at those days, but we had a wonderful time just being there.

44
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:39,139
I'm falling in love with sushi and so Yoki in Station Landing has been a wonderful place to eat and also they've been a wonderful supporter of our program.

45
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,460
So it's been great.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,961
And Red Sox is my favorite sushi.

47
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,001
What's in the Red Sox?

48
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,202
Oh, I wouldn't even know.

49
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,283
But it has some tempura in it.

50
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:53,217
special kind of rice, and it's just beautiful.

51
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:53,957
Great.

52
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,938
I always forget about station landing and the Medford spot, so yeah, thank you.

53
00:03:58,278 --> 00:03:58,618
Awesome.

54
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:04,600
So if you guys could both each tell me about kind of what, how you got involved with the Medford Founding Network, sort of what it means to you.

55
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:06,321
Sure.

56
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:13,763
Well, I have been blessed since 1994 to be able to have the opportunity to utilize the funding

57
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,202
that had been put in place by the superintendent at that time.

58
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:25,907
There was a new grant in place to the Department of Education and grants were sent out to all the school departments across the state.

59
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,331
And seven of those were given grants to run a brand new entity called the Family Network.

60
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,012
It had never been done before.

61
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:43,098
The goal was to engage families at the birth of a child and into age four to help parents to understand child development, to secure their

62
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:51,078
you know, a child abuse prevention aspect of things, and also to have them comfortable with helping their children academically.

63
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,201
And also to broach the achievement gap.

64
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,482
That was a piece of that as well.

65
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,804
You'll notice I said till four.

66
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:06,912
So we got the grant, Medford was one of the 200 were submitted, seven were accepted, Medford proudly won that.

67
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:14,833
And at that time I was a social worker at the then DSS and received a phone call saying, why haven't you applied for this job?

68
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,294
And I said, what?

69
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:16,995
What job?

70
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:26,625
I guess I had helped them in the past design some family programming through another call and they asked me if I would consider applying for the job.

71
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:27,026
I did.

72
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,536
I got it, and it's been wonderful ever since.

73
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:38,577
And later years, about five years after that, I wrote a new grant called the Children's Trust Grant to then up our age to age eight.

74
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,817
My ultimate goal was to go up to 18.

75
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:42,178
That hasn't happened yet.

76
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:46,978
I did get a mini one at 13 about 10 years ago, but that has gone now.

77
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,779
But anyway, so that's how that became.

78
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,900
My background is a social worker, a teacher, a head staff director, and teacher.

79
00:05:56,935 --> 00:06:03,432
and a community organization specialist with the Office for Children for 10 years, kind of all kind of blended to kind of

80
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:12,966
bring hopefully some skills to how do we create something that literally is on a piece of paper and had to be built, you know, made flesh and real.

81
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:18,308
So I kind of put those skills together and literally walked the pavements of Medford.

82
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:27,691
I'm a Medford-born gal, so I knew the streets and the roads and how to walk around and talk to people, which I did a lot of.

83
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,452
So it's fair to say you created the Medford family?

84
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:30,693
Yeah.

85
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,293
Wow, great.

86
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,773
But, you know, you don't do that alone.

87
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,073
You build a community.

88
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:37,375
Everything is all about relationships, right?

89
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:41,177
I was lucky to have had relationships with community members as a social worker.

90
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,518
I worked with all the other organizations, the school department.

91
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:57,905
I was in every school overseeing my kids, you know, and so I had some already some things in place where I could tap into and people could call upon to help me, you know, get into the nitty gritty of Medford.

92
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:08,700
Fellow social worker here, but I think it's um, yeah, it's interesting to hear like I think programs like DCF, what it's now called, I feel like are always looking for resources like this.

93
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,781
Like where can we send these families for support?

94
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,341
Where can we help them sort of adjust to being new parents?

95
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:18,142
And it sounds like you were able to use that experience to design a program to do just that.

96
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,202
Absolutely, yeah.

97
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:19,522
Awesome.

98
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:21,503
And Caroline, what about you?

99
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,523
How did you get involved with MSN?

100
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:27,927
I was lucky enough to be introduced to Marie before I even had children.

101
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:39,514
And so I knew about the MFN and I knew that I wasn't going to have a lot of family support just because I don't have much family in the area when I was pregnant.

102
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:45,958
And so I was excited and ready and started bringing my first child who is now five and a half

103
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:53,476
here when he was seven days old to the parent support group, to creative coping.

104
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:59,358
And literally from that day, I met life-changing friends.

105
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,452
And it has been such an amazing support for me.

106
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,453
I am a graphic designer by trade.

107
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:21,176
And when probably my son was two or three, friends approached me about if I was interested in helping out with the advisory board or the friends, partially to bring on my skills.

108
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,416
And I was happy to be a part of it.

109
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:27,617
And over time, I focused more on the fundraising.

110
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:30,458
And then I guess I've officially been the president for

111
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:32,739
three-ish years.

112
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,261
Um, and it's been fun.

113
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:45,708
And, you know, honestly through COVID times, it was really fun and interesting to have to recreate or do a lot of new programming, um, for fundraising.

114
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:51,973
And it has been amazing what this community has stepped up and given and they get excited about our events.

115
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:59,318
And, um, I'm really thankful to be a part, um, of both the friends, which is the fundraising arm of,

116
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:04,146
the MFN as well as a sitting member on the advisory board as well.

117
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,189
And can you say a little bit more about the advisory board, like what that is?

118
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:09,630
Yeah.

119
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:20,659
So there are two different boards that help with the MFN, one of which was the friends, and then there's also the advisory board, which are, maybe Marie, you can go into a little more detail.

120
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,743
I actually created that when we first started.

121
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:30,827
The first thing I did, because I understood that parent leadership isn't key, and we have to define what leadership means.

122
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,187
It isn't being at a podium.

123
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:36,490
It's being part of a team that can actualize and move things.

124
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,272
So I created what was first called the steering committee to help me steer this thing.

125
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,313
And then it created

126
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:59,437
an advisory board, I wrote bylaws, I was a bylaw writer in a previous life, and I love parliamentary procedure, so I created a group of 12 parents and raised them with bylaws and were charged with helping me

127
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:13,437
The eyes and ears of this city helped me know if I don't know what's going on in this part of the city or what's in this neighborhood, helped me to understand how we're going to make this program work and how we can be best in the city.

128
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,758
At that point we had nothing.

129
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,700
We had no place to be.

130
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:25,486
So we had to find churches and a homeless shelter and the after school areas and in other places.

131
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:40,190
Grocery stores wherever we could go literally to have a spotless place and we did that for several years But the advisory board always helped me and they grew in its ability to feel its leadership to

132
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:51,713
to promote programming, and I've seen so many parents come through kind of reticent in the beginning, kind of maybe not knowing what to do but wanting to do something.

133
00:10:51,733 --> 00:11:00,442
And after several years, they've just shown and just have been a really advocate for themselves, for their children, and for our community at large.

134
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:09,390
They have been a cornerstone of the FEMI network for 27 of the 28 years we've been here.

135
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,812
Wow, that's interesting.

136
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:15,797
I feel like there's a lot of organizations that have the board, which is mostly fundraising, right?

137
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:24,405
And some approving of what the organization can do, but it sounds like you've separated that to a fundraising capacity and a program development capacity.

138
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,336
Well, what happened was about 20 years ago, the funding was drying up.

139
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,282
So I didn't know what to do.

140
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,145
So I said, well,

141
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:33,205
I'll create a 501C3.

142
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:39,006
And there was no, no one had done it in the entire state of any of these programs, so I figured it out how to do that.

143
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:49,988
And my husband and I wrote it, wrote the 501C3, and went down to the treasurer's office, plucked out $15, and got a 501C3.

144
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:57,649
We named it the Friends of the Medford Family Network, and they said, we'll do an ink, a company, and then corporation just sounded like so awesome.

145
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,570
So it's now the Friends of the Medford Family Network Corporation.

146
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,054
And I understood then that we have to have separate, but demonstrate alignment.

147
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:06,836
We have to be separated.

148
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:20,290
So I took three of the board members at that time who were willing to be the first, the three first members, and they became the president, the recording person, and the treasurer, and just built it.

149
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:26,947
And now you see it flourishing like never before under the wing of Caroline.

150
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:33,993
But it took so many amazing people to step up and create those new fundraising opportunities.

151
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,575
And it's an ebb and flow.

152
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,396
Some years are stronger than others.

153
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:42,840
But I'm seeing an amazing strength now because of the years that we've built into it.

154
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,363
And it's like anything, the foundation is building stronger than ever.

155
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,325
So that's how that.

156
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:56,193
So basically we took from, we leveraged the leisure that was in place and created a node through those programs.

157
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:56,613
Wow.

158
00:12:57,114 --> 00:13:03,320
So Marie, you've seen the program through its whole development up until now, and Caroline, you've been in the program for several years, it sounds like.

159
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,866
I'm wondering if you could speak to some of your favorite moments or favorite parts of being involved with a family network.

160
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:16,343
For me, the most favorite part is when parents are talking to each other.

161
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:24,010
I think Caroline alluded to that when she said some of my best friends and longest-term friends, and I'm so proud that that's what it's all about.

162
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:31,696
It gives us a sense of belonging, a sense of having someone by your side, the go-tos.

163
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:35,560
And whatever we taught here in terms of parenting education,

164
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:45,508
and had those programs that most of them are curriculum-based and I've researched them thoroughly for many years and created a few.

165
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:48,351
What we hear on the streets, why don't you try it this way?

166
00:13:48,711 --> 00:14:02,283
Instead of walking away or scouring at an interaction between a parent and child, just knowing that it's okay to say, I know what it feels like, I know that feeling, and hey, try it this way.

167
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:06,806
And for me, that's the most favorite thing that that happened.

168
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:16,893
My whole point is planting seeds and to see them grow, having the good luck to see them grow once in a while and flourish, that is amazing to me.

169
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:31,233
That sounds like you've created a pretty organic peer model, right, where you're saying it can feel really maybe condescending to hear a provider or someone tell you, like, here's a way you could do this, but to hear it from someone who you know is sort of doing the same thing.

170
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:37,658
To that end, just very quickly, the first thing I did when I got signed on online was

171
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,477
The word client popped up.

172
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:43,220
As a social worker, I know that word well, as do you, don't you?

173
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,842
So I said, there are no clients here.

174
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,885
There are parents and there are families, and that's what there are.

175
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:56,213
So client was gone, and I just hope that that kind of told the world that, you know, you are you, and that's awesome.

176
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:57,655
Thank you.

177
00:14:58,936 --> 00:14:59,316
And Cameron?

178
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:11,206
Um, I mean, as I alluded to some that, I mean, the new parenting classes really introduced me to, um, a great, great group of families in town.

179
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:24,956
And then through playground play groups and concerts, it's just amazing that, you know, because of my connections through things at the MFN I've done, you know, I can go almost anywhere in town and run into people.

180
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:30,260
And, you know, they've all seen our kids enough and interacted enough that

181
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:35,292
It helps you feel comfortable, you know, where you are in this town.

182
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:43,058
And I find it just so, so important because, you know, so many of us, you know, no longer have family that lives right by and things like that.

183
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:47,682
And so this is a way to kind of create your own families and your own network.

184
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:52,125
And so, you know, it's just wonderful.

185
00:15:52,145 --> 00:16:05,853
And then, you know, things like the swap that, you know, it's just been the clothing swap, which has changed over the years with the direction of Tamar and, you know, what we can provide, you know,

186
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:15,307
both on the sense of saving money, but also saving the resources and environment by sharing our goods with everyone else in the community.

187
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,468
I mean, it's just been amazing.

188
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:27,495
So I guess I didn't pinpoint one thing, but really the sense of community that I feel like it brings to Medford is so important to me.

189
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,039
I need to say too, Danielle, that what Carolyn talks about, it's

190
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,761
It's because of an amazing team we have in place here.

191
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:38,022
The world knows Ms.

192
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:48,707
Andrea Breen, who's done an amazing job over the years as a playbook leader, and has stepped up and pivoted unbelievably during COVID like no one could.

193
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,608
Kept us outside safe.

194
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,230
rediscovered the world for parents, literally.

195
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:59,194
She walked all over to make sure we could get outside and take care of ourselves and be safe.

196
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:16,286
And Brenda Kennedy, who does our ages and stages questionnaire, our screening part, giving parents the skills to understand children through five different skill set domains and giving them constant support in those areas, making referrals all the time as needed, early intervention, other kinds of programs.

197
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:25,832
And Heather Fuller, who does an amazing job with the marketing and assists me in all of my work and my reports and all of that kind of thing, but does a great job marketing.

198
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:34,934
And Miss Cindy Sabag, who is also doing marketing, my child care, now working with a pre-K and K playgroup leadership program.

199
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:41,315
And then the team of parenting educators that we bring on, it's just a whole

200
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,856
cadre of different people coming together.

201
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:45,857
And it changes.

202
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:51,819
So the basic of how we evolve, what do we need more of, less of, always that kind of thing.

203
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,580
I do want to do one quick thing and that is just like, and who are we missing?

204
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,901
That's the key question for me.

205
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,382
Who are we missing?

206
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,383
This city has changed so dramatically.

207
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:05,264
from when I was here, which was 4,000 years ago.

208
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:09,945
But it has so changed, and we want to not miss them.

209
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:15,286
And we'll talk about how we're responding to that need through the Cummings grant in a minute.

210
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,888
But we need to constantly ask my staff, where are we not?

211
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,448
Where do we need to be?

212
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:22,856
Who are we missing?

213
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,377
How are we missing them?

214
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:25,417
And how do we get them?

215
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:30,780
So it's a very exciting, constant way to be, because we're never satisfied.

216
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,481
We're never just going to be placated.

217
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,382
We're just going to be always, always evolving.

218
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:35,762
Right.

219
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:43,145
And that actually was a great lead-in to my next question, which was about the mission of the MFN and how that aligns with equity in the city.

220
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:49,928
And I wonder if you could speak to some of the things that you're already doing, and then also maybe what's on the horizon for addressing those goals.

221
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:50,788
Sure.

222
00:18:52,764 --> 00:19:05,396
Well, I think we are feeling center itself is reflective of the diversity that is by our pictures in our books and our everything that we have in here, our language.

223
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,713
of the increasing diversity of Medford.

224
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,274
And we have to think of diversity in a variety of ways, too.

225
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:20,578
Age, children with special needs, in all the ways that diversity exhibits itself.

226
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,722
Single parents, those who are marginalized in any kind of way.

227
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:33,925
We need to look at the diversity of how one raises children, what needs.

228
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,431
to be effective for what they want.

229
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:40,111
We don't put any value system in place.

230
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:45,052
We ask you to think about these ideas and place them into your value system as you see it.

231
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:55,755
And so the advisory board created Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, which we're going to, I think, generalize into a group as opposed to just a committee.

232
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:02,397
And we're working with a diversity director in Medford, Frances Nelage, very intentionally to be

233
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:08,881
really work our programs that make it much more.

234
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:14,366
And then, you know, Corita Anderson, she's an amazing counselor in Medford.

235
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:21,272
She had helped us with raising sexually healthy children years ago, those courses, and now I'm bringing her back in.

236
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:29,039
She's going to be helping me with making sure our programs are very reflective of that and of diversity.

237
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,183
And also looking at ourselves as an organization.

238
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:45,700
I'm putting myself and our staff through training to look at how are we, how do we view the world, what are our biases, and let's deal with them and acknowledge and then move with our language.

239
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:54,424
So it's a big issue, but as Caroline said, we've got so many wonderful things going on in this city that can help us do that.

240
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,005
New boards being created.

241
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:05,047
I was on the Human Rights Commission for years and years, and a lot of good stuff is coming up with that, and plenty of opportunity.

242
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:06,007
Thank you.

243
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,848
Did you have anything, Caroline?

244
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:14,930
Yeah, I mean, one thing that in the programming that I've been involved in the last couple years, I mean, last year we

245
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:28,770
had to do some of our summer concerts in another location, namely Harris Park, which has a brand new amazing playground, water park, and we had a great night.

246
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:35,690
that is almost as far away from our core location here at the high school as you can be in Medford.

247
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:44,052
And we were really shocked at how many parents showed up just because they saw something going on and had no idea about the Medford Family Network.

248
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:49,314
To me, it's just an ingrained part of what every parent in Medford should know, but that was a real understanding of

249
00:21:50,447 --> 00:22:05,276
Oh, maybe we're really not reaching a lot of people and I know when we did when Cindy sent out a lot of the stuff to new families, you know, it was in a lot of apartment buildings and a lot of things on sort of like more than Medford or the mold inside of Medford.

250
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:14,338
And one thing that we really are trying to open up is making sure that we are reaching everyone.

251
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:23,367
And that is part of why Marie and myself and a whole team of people applied for the amazing Cummings grant.

252
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,431
a Cummings Foundation grant this year.

253
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:43,467
And we are so blessed to have been awarded $100,000 over three years with the goal of really trying to expand our programming and really targeting areas and different groups in the city

254
00:22:44,337 --> 00:23:01,481
who we're not currently hitting, whether it's one thing we found that there's certain families that have a lot of trouble getting to the MFN, but they need our physical resources and diapers and formula and things like that, but they're also not able for a number of reasons to attend some of our programming.

255
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:09,423
So the goal with the money we've received from the Cummings Foundation is to hire

256
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:31,169
an additional person to really help spread out and really focus on who, as Marie said, who we're missing and how we can adjust programming and adjust our offerings to really make sure that we are reaching everyone who needs it.

257
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:36,213
Because yeah, the Medford Family Network is, I mean, as we've all said is, you know,

258
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:40,363
a very, very unique thing in this town, or in this area.

259
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:50,784
And wanna make sure that we can really make sure everyone knows of what they can get out of being a part of the Medford Family Network.

260
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,465
Seems like a real privilege to be connected to the Medford Family Network, right?

261
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,826
Making sure that it's accessible to as many people as it can be.

262
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:00,846
Well, thanks for mentioning the Cummings grant.

263
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:05,747
I'm wondering if there's anything else that you wanna make sure to mention or promote while we're talking to each other.

264
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:15,982
I just think that due to that end, we really are seeking voices that have not been heard yet.

265
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:20,488
There are many resilient families in Medford that we know whose need for

266
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:34,374
is that for English classes, and we're going to be providing them in the fall, and also their need for programming on the weekends as opposed to weekdays, and maybe on certain times of the day, evenings.

267
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:38,096
Child care is a huge need in our Brazilian community.

268
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:45,740
So we're looking to take an honest approach and address all of those issues.

269
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,420
Yeah.

270
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:52,444
And I know we, I've mentioned it before in the podcast, but you have a gala coming up as well.

271
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:53,465
Yes.

272
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:54,145
So excited.

273
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:54,666
Yes.

274
00:24:54,806 --> 00:25:00,770
We, the gala, um, which traditionally as we call it the night, um, of 10,000 lights.

275
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:08,236
Um, we, unfortunately because of COVID, we're not able to, um, have it the last couple of years.

276
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:12,659
And we are really, really excited to be able to resurrect.

277
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:37,065
um the gala this year in a whole different way um traditionally was at the city hall um up in the i forgot the name of the room the the uh the the council chambers yes the chambers which has been wonderful but um with covid and also one thing you know we're trying to figure out how can we

278
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:39,400
get more people.

279
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,565
It's a wonderful, beautiful space, but it limited the amount of people we could have.

280
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:54,477
And so we are pivoting, and with the help of the Medford Rec Department, we are going to be hosting it at Wright's Pond on September 10th.

281
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:56,739
I believe it will be 6 to 10 o'clock.

282
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:06,588
And this is going to be a night, unlike any of the others, we are going to have a full band.

283
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,970
In the past, the music had to be sort of in the background.

284
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:20,339
We have hired a local dad who is also a very talented musician with a number of different projects.

285
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,202
But his project, the Mancini Soul Project,

286
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:31,743
is a cover band that is going to just help us really, really celebrate the night on the stage there.

287
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:43,290
We're going to have, it looks like we'll have some local restaurants doing catering and we really are looking for the community to come together both for a fun night.

288
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:49,855
We're also going to be reaching out to local businesses to help us put together some really strong

289
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:59,436
options for our raffle prizes and our silent auction, as well as our grab bags, which are a huge part of the fundraising of the night.

290
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:08,018
Traditionally, we try to raise $15,000 to $20,000, but we are trying to up that this year.

291
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:20,041
After not being together for a few years for this big event, we're really trying to push the goal to try and raise $25,000 that night, which a lot of the money that the Friends of the Medford Family Network

292
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:29,825
raises goes directly towards summer programming because a lot of the grants that we do receive only apply for around the school year.

293
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:33,207
So, you know, all the various things that happen during the summer.

294
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:44,912
Um, you know, it's a big part of what the friends have to help, you know, and also to help us expand, you know, the Cummings grant is a huge, huge help for us, but we have a lot of things that we want to do.

295
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:54,438
Um, and a lot of people that, you know, have really stepped up over the years that we want to help, you know, help keep this place growing and continue.

296
00:27:54,718 --> 00:28:03,324
So, um, you can, um, currently get tickets, um, at the friends of the MFN.org forward slash gala.

297
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:22,238
GALA And until a month before the event so the event is September 10th, which is a Saturday night We're gonna the rain date of the next day the Sunday then 11th We have an early bird special so if you can use the Promo code early bird.

298
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:31,603
It'll get you 20% off the tickets We currently have at least two levels of ticketing one of which is our general ticketing which

299
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:41,071
I think we're doing one drink ticket with that, dinner, dessert, music, just so much fun.

300
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:47,878
We also have a special VIP ticket available now as well, which will have open bar.

301
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:53,691
some commemorative cups with it and really helps to just step up our programming.

302
00:28:54,372 --> 00:29:06,903
And then if you really want to be an extra part of it, there are also gold and silver star tickets as well, which directly impact us in a very significant way.

303
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:09,545
So all that can be found on the Friends website.

304
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:13,168
Again, it's friends of the MFN forward slash gala.

305
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,064
And you're still looking for sponsors for this?

306
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:15,945
Absolutely.

307
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,787
So we have an amazing team of people.

308
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:25,934
With it being the summer, we are, I don't want to say behind, but you know, we're all working together as we can in between camps and vacations.

309
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:32,299
And so we have an amazing team that are reaching out to different businesses, um, by email and phone.

310
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:41,227
Um, and would love, um, you know, we're really looking to have community members help us put together awesome packages.

311
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:45,440
and gift baskets that we can raffle and sell.

312
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,447
It sounds like it's going to be a great night.

313
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:49,349
Fantastic.

314
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,314
What does the name mean, Night of 10,000?

315
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:59,383
Um, well traditionally it was when it was, um, we had twinkle lights all over the chamber.

316
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:03,465
And so I think originally it was actually night of, it was under balloons, right?

317
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,165
It was the night of 10,000 balloons.

318
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:05,625
Yeah.

319
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:06,706
Original name.

320
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,567
That was Debbie Steiner Hayes, right?

321
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:11,328
She was still an amazing supporter on a lot of our events.

322
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,829
And Springstep, where it was first held for several years.

323
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:15,249
Balloons everywhere.

324
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:23,554
And then we had to, when we moved it, the balloons, we couldn't use them anymore or something like that, so we had to change it, and change it to the lights.

325
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,557
And the City Hall was amazing, just lights everywhere.

326
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:31,280
And that became Twinkle Bags, and we used that kind of...

327
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,441
It was great.

328
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:33,861
Yeah.

329
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:41,006
And so now moving it to Wright's Pond, we adjusted a little bit being the night under 10,000 lights.

330
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:41,847
Don't you love it?

331
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:46,150
It's going to be, especially in September, will be, you know, the sun will go down.

332
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,852
You know, there will be lights as well.

333
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,534
But, you know, to really focus on how beautiful it is there.

334
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:54,876
And fingers crossed, it will be a clear and beautiful night.

335
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:58,138
And we can see the, you know, millions and millions of stars.

336
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,020
So swim attire for you.

337
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:22,264
fun attire for sure if you go swimming that that will be on your own I think double-check that I believe we're gonna have a couple lifeguards but we said that the night is not about swimming more focus on the music and fun and everything but yes have have fun where where what you're comfortable with and

338
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:23,625
We'll have a great time.

339
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:24,265
Great.

340
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:24,705
Thank you.

341
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:28,228
So my last question, unless there's anything else that we've missed.

342
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:38,355
So if you were to imagine yourself not having come to the Medford Family Network at all, what would be your recommendation for an entry point?

343
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,596
What's the first place people should check out?

344
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:45,900
Do we have a place to check out in Medford?

345
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,280
No.

346
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,102
What's the best entry point to the Medford Family Network?

347
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:50,002
Where should people go?

348
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:51,243
What kind of event should they attend?

349
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,442
This is real true, but it's kind of funny.

350
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:03,406
I canvass the baby isles of CVS, literally, to find them.

351
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:04,386
That's how I get them.

352
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:10,630
Or I go to Dunkin Donuts and see, you know, moms sitting there or dads with their babies and like, what do I do now?

353
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,410
That kind of thing.

354
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,352
So I literally canvass the CVS.

355
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:16,313
So go to CVS baby isle and I'll find you.

356
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:21,637
And what do you recommend people check out as a first try for the Family Network?

357
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:22,938
Oh, the first thing to try?

358
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,258
Yeah.

359
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:31,304
Depending on the age, and that's why I love this program, because if you've got a baby, if you have a toddler, if you have a child, there's so much you can experience.

360
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:43,360
The concert, I think, blew away so many families last Tuesday who had never come because, oh, it's Wright's Pond, oh, they never came.

361
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,284
Several came up to me and said, Marie, you've been talking about this for years, this is amazing.

362
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:50,447
Look at these people, look at my children, they don't want to leave.

363
00:32:51,067 --> 00:33:01,310
You know, so if you go to a bigger family, at least show you what we've built for the past 20 years in terms of camaraderie, belonging, knowing each other.

364
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,151
That might be a great way for someone who can handle that kind of thing.

365
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,671
Another way is just come and visit.

366
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:09,231
When you find us, visit.

367
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:10,012
Sit down with me.

368
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:10,972
Sit down with our staff.

369
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:14,474
look around, see yourself here.

370
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,857
You will see yourself here, but who you are, you're going to see.

371
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:22,441
In fact, an Indian grandfather came in and said, there I am.

372
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,101
I said, what?

373
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,662
It was a picture of me and my family.

374
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:25,783
And it wasn't.

375
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,185
It was a stark picture I had all over the place here.

376
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:29,686
But you will see yourself.

377
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:30,887
And that's what matters.

378
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:36,932
That then you can start here and find others who, through

379
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:41,535
you know, our programming that will hopefully become your friends and your supports.

380
00:33:41,675 --> 00:34:00,149
That word belonging I think is striking to me, right, especially for families with young kids who maybe are new to Medford or feel like they don't have a place here, right, that like I think it's Caroline spoke to this a little bit too, but I've heard anecdotally from lots of families like once you're connecting with those resources for your kids it feels like this is a place that you can belong.

381
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,291
Yeah, I mean it's amazing that, you know,

382
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:08,825
There's open time play groups or play time that you can just come here.

383
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:11,467
It's an extension of your living room.

384
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,849
You can try new toys and then just slowly meet if that's how you need to do it.

385
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,150
Just slowly introduce yourself.

386
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,953
I also, I believe they're on hold right now with Andrea on vacation, but the summer

387
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:23,519
playground playgroups.

388
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:27,302
Every time I go, I am just floored at how many families are there.

389
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:33,588
And it's just an amazing, easy way to just kind of, you know, put your foot in a little bit.

390
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:36,111
Um, you know, they're all over the city.

391
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:43,498
Um, there's a schedule on the calendar, um, which you can find through, um, the medfordfamilynetwork.org.

392
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:45,560
Um, there's a link to the calendar right there.

393
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,652
Um, and yeah, that's a great way.

394
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:53,933
Um, you know, and then if you're a new parent, um, currently the parent support group is still on zoom.

395
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:55,773
It's coming back in September.

396
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,953
Oh, it is.

397
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:58,134
Yeah.

398
00:34:58,154 --> 00:34:58,514
September.

399
00:34:58,534 --> 00:34:59,734
They can just tell me less.

400
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:01,474
Oh, awesome.

401
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:01,714
Yeah.

402
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:06,035
So, um, yeah, I mean the same woman has been running it for about 10.

403
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:06,435
Yeah.

404
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:14,437
And it's been running it for over 10 years and you know, it's just an amazing way to come in and just

405
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:23,247
have an understanding that there are other moms who are going through what you're going through, whether you're a first time mom, second time mom, you know, go there.

406
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,670
And, you know, as I would kind of say, you just, yeah, and dads for sure.

407
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,993
Um, yeah, I mean, parents of, yeah.

408
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:35,598
Um, you know, just to let it out, to just express what, what's your trouble.

409
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:39,242
And there'll be someone else in the group who has, you know,

410
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:58,357
The facilitator is an amazing job, you know, we're not pushing each other to do something right or wrong But just a way to help everyone relate to each other and give some gentle suggestions or ideas or nothing You know just to let it out and you know that there's so many different struggles that people are going through whether it's you know

411
00:35:59,545 --> 00:36:21,455
know with breastfeeding not breastfeeding diapers sleep I mean and everyone has so many different issues that you know it's just good to know and sometimes it's even oh wait my issue is this but yours is at the opposite end and you're struggling with them and you know in some ways which is so good to know that you know everyone has their own struggles and it's such a great way just to really get through I mean

412
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:29,564
You know, I mean, some parents are ready a week like me, others, you know, it takes a lot longer to feel strong and ready to leave the house.

413
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:34,809
And maybe that's why right now, while it's on Zoom, it's also a great way to easily approach it.

414
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:37,071
So, and again, those are on the calendar.

415
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,132
Yeah, and one important thing to mention is the location.

416
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:41,892
Oh, thank you.

417
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:44,392
So you guys are outside of the high school, the purple door, right?

418
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,433
Yes, the purple door.

419
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:51,394
So as you approach the high school off of Windsor Street, 489 Windsor Street is the address, the Medford High School.

420
00:36:51,674 --> 00:37:03,156
Just go straight up, do not go to the parking lot, just go straight up to the corner of the building, go by a little bit, you'll see the purple door, big sign, Medford Family Network, and there's a ramp leading up to our door if you need to have a stroller.

421
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:06,077
So ring the doorbell and come on in.

422
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,143
But you're a friend to know, and you're a place to grow.

423
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,686
Well, thank you both so much for making the time for me.

424
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:13,847
It's been great for me.

425
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:14,987
You've been great.

426
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:15,928
You've been wonderful.

427
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:16,328
Thank you.

428
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:16,688
Thank you.

429
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,169
Thank you.

430
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:19,070
Hopefully we'll see you at the gala.

431
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,371
Yeah, absolutely.

432
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:27,316
Absolutely.

433
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:30,738
Thanks so much to Caroline and Marie.
