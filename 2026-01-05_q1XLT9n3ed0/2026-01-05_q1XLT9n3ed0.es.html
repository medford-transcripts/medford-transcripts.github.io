    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=299.602s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  Thank you.
 Good evening.
 So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.
 This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.
 always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.
 My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.
 None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.
 A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.
 This work is very demanding and it is very complex.
 and it keeps you on your toes.
 And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.
 And it is work that you take home with you.
 Yet it is carried out.
 in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.
 I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.
 Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.
 I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.
 Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.
 I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.
 The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.
 Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.
 I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.
 On the next slide, please.
 What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.
 So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.
 The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 During that time, we began to work
 a lot on our instructional excellence.
 We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.
 That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.
 You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.
 creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.
 It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.
 As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.
 This spoke about the work that I had done really working on
 the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.
 All of that to bring with me to this position.
 If we could please go to the next slide.
 This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.
 So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.
 I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence
 through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.
 I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.
 So to begin, our core values
 were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.
 They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.
 These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.
 So there is collaborative effort.
 and input put into the core values.
 Next slide, please.
 Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.
 We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.
 And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.
 So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.
 Who are we?
 How do we lead?
 What we expect?
 And how do we communicate?
 Next slide, please.
 So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.
 When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,
 a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.
 Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.
 uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.
 My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.
 That was the work that really began.
 It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.
 When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.
 Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.
 This slide talks about that.
 I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.
 It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.
 and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.
 I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.
 It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.
 This is something that is
 still growing.
 This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.
 It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.
 We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.
 They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.
 We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.
 We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.
 I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.
 This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful
 negotiations with the teachers.
 And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.
 And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.
 And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.
 And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,
 That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.
 And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.
 And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.
 This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.
 It also brought us recognition and a highlight
 from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.
 And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,
 on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.
 Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.
 Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.
 And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.
 So I do think it's important to note we've had a big
 reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
 My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.
 They're bringing with them years of
 experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.
 With that, I was very intentional.
 I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.
 and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.
 So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in
 her permanent position.
 We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.
 That's really helped to stabilize the district.
 It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.
 But they also started mid to late August.
 So we are still in the stages of building
 what we know we need to do.
 A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.
 The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.
 So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.
 But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.
 And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,
 is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.
 I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.
 Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Ruseau in all of the bargaining units.
 There was a significant amount of work done last year.
 We're still going with some other units.
 Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.
 So, strengthening operational foundations.
 What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.
 For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.
 Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.
 On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.
 Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.
 So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.
 in the short time he's been here so far.
 So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.
 This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.
 This has been part of ongoing conversations.
 Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.
 Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.
 That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.
 The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.
 Heating and roof leaks.
 par for the course in the past year.
 There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.
 We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.
 Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.
 A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.
 Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.
 To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered
 speedily through Amazon.
 And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.
 But you just don't know what's going to happen.
 And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.
 The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.
 Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.
 Strengthening safety.
 So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.
 Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.
 What that has looked like is an update.
 and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.
 This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.
 to mostly fruition.
 We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their
 ability to come in and out of work.
 So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.
 School-based and district-level safety committees.
 So those have begun.
 Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.
 And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.
 And I think he had a meeting today.
 This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.
 It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.
 And then lastly for operations would be community schools.
 This is an ongoing.
 area of focus and review.
 So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.
 That's mostly the rental of our buildings.
 It also sees our summer programming summer fun.
 but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.
 So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.
 Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating
 a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.
 We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start
 We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.
 That is an area where it wasn't
 completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.
 I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.
 And for them, some of this came as a surprise.
 So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.
 So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.
 Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.
 Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.
 That through line is our shared sense of belonging.
 It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are
 mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.
 So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that
 may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.
 So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so
 critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.
 And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.
 It was used for instruction.
 And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.
 more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.
 It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support
 is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.
 At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what
 individuals need.
 That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.
 And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging
 CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.
 And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day
 Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.
 dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.
 So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.
 Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.
 And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.
 High quality instructional materials
 make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.
 Next slide.
 Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.
 This is work that
 Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.
 We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.
 We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.
 We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students
 have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.
 We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.
 It's that transfer.
 Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.
 And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.
 The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.
 and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.
 Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.
 So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.
 She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.
 She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders
 and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.
 That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.
 They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.
 This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.
 Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.
 But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.
 This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.
 And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,
 is progress monitoring their students.
 Everyone has a caseload.
 We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.
 And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.
 Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.
 I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data
 In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.
 Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.
 One of this has been some of my favorite.
 I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year
 twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.
 And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,
 means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.
 with teachers in buildings.
 And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 She's had several meetings with them.
 OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.
 This is
 a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.
 So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.
 On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.
 MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.
 We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.
 And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.
 So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.
 We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment
 Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.
 And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.
 But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor
 is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.
 And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the
 caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.
 The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.
 Communication and partnership.
 In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.
 I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.
 It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.
 With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.
 And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.
 expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.
 We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.
 Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.
 Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that
 you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.
 This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 Administrators.
 Yes, yes.
 School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.
 When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.
 We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.
 And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.
 The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.
 I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.
 I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.
 We have some upcoming forums this month.
 But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,
 the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.
 So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.
 And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.
 We are very mindful though of our search committees.
 So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.
 So that is something that we have committed to
 before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.
 And there's the task force committee.
 So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.
 As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.
 who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.
 I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.
 I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.
 It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.
 So it's important that we hear from
 from all voices.
 An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.
 And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.
 And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.
 MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.
 And then just like one example of a district-based one is
 The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.
 I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.
 Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.
 I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.
 But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.
 But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.
 So that is ongoing work for myself.
 But I have really
 committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.
 I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.
 Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,
 but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.
 It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.
 And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 I just want to make sure that I am
 working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.
 And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.
 Next slide, please.
 So with all this said, planning for the future.
 So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.
 With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.
 They are goals that we want to maintain.
 It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.
 And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.
 So first, our continuing priorities.
 These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.
 The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.
 that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.
 So strengthening those supports for students
 so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.
 And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.
 Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.
 So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.
 And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.
 Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.
 also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.
 So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.
 I think that's an important thing to note.
 So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.
 And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.
 So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.
 And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.
 And I think
 each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.
 And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.
 I did highlight this in my
 report of interim findings.
 That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.
 So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.
 Enhancing communication and community trust.
 So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures
 making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.
 All of that is continuous work.
 and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.
 We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I
 it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.
 So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing
 And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.
 How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.
 That's work that will be continuing.
 Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.
 and how they're working with them.
 That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.
 And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.
 And our CBA before,
 did not have any layers of educator leadership.
 And now it does.
 And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.
 And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.
 That is work that is ongoing for us.
 Now moving to work that our new goals.
 And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.
 So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.
 This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.
 But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.
 One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.
 I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.
 This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction
 available effectively and meaningfully for students.
 That is work that is critical.
 the implementation of open architects.
 So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.
 And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.
 Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.
 So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.
 Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff
 at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.
 And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.
 And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.
 Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.
 This is a true goal here.
 Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.
 Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.
 I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.
 We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.
 And that is wonderful.
 And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.
 There might be one at the elementary.
 But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.
 Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.
 The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.
 She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think
 her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.
 But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.
 And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been
 Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.
 And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.
 Once we have a process, we find a way to
 fine tune and make it better.
 Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.
 I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision
 and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.
 Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.
 It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.
 And it's through the MSBA forum.
 And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.
 We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're
 getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.
 And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.
 So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.
 It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.
 And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.
 And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4033.578s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias.
 Gracias, doctor Galusi.
 Muy completo, excelente presentación.
 ¿Hay alguna pregunta del cuerpo?
 ¿Miembro Ruseau?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4045.305s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias.
 Eso fue mucho.
 Pero antes que nada, quiero decir que estoy emocionado y esto es muy ruidoso hoy.
 Me encanta que quede claro que puedes caminar y masticar chicle al mismo tiempo.
 No pude encontrar una buena analogía que sonara menos americana, para que todos la entendieran.
 Pero es bueno ver la cantidad de cosas diferentes que estás cubriendo.
 Bueno, francamente, cubriste todo lo que parecía.
 Varias veces pensé, oh sí, nosotros también hacemos eso, ¿no?
 Entonces las comunicaciones son, como ustedes saben, algo que es.
 dramáticamente mejor que cuando comencé hace ocho años y estoy emocionado con el progreso que hemos logrado.
 Es una de esas cosas en las que tienes razón nunca se hace.
 No sé si es porque la audiencia cambia o si tal vez simplemente lleva mucho tiempo desarrollar completamente un sistema para hacerlo bien todo el tiempo.
 Pero mi hija llegó tarde a la escuela hoy y quiero leer las dos oraciones de ese correo electrónico que recibimos.
 Entiendo, nos gustaría ayudarlo a usted y a su estudiante en todo lo que podamos para aliviar este problema de asistencia.
 Cada vez que un estudiante tiene tardanzas, es una preocupación para nosotros, ya que las tardanzas hacen que el estudiante pierda instrucción importante y oportunidades de aprendizaje en la escuela.
 Y simplemente, no sé cuándo cambió esto.
 Creo que podría haber sido este año.
 Pero creo que es un muy buen ejemplo de cómo no hay nada en todo esto, hay más en el correo electrónico, pero no hay nada allí sobre cumplimiento y DESE y conseguir al, no Fiscal General, pero ¿quién?
 ¿Notario?
 No, sabes que si tienes demasiadas ausencias solíamos recibir cartas automáticas como del fiscal de distrito con jerga legal. Sí, y entonces es en lugar de un montón de amenazas. Es como ¿cómo podemos ayudar a su estudiante a obtener su educación?
 Por eso estamos aquí.
 Eso es lo que queremos.
 Entonces parece una cosa menor, pero ese correo electrónico es tan
 descriptivo de lo que he visto como cambio en el distrito desde que usted se convirtió en superintendente interino, así que es maravilloso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4189.901s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: ¿Puedo simplemente resaltar eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4190.902s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4191.462s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Ése también es sólo un ejemplo de esa línea transversal de nuestro cargo de pertenencia.
 Porque para que una familia reciba a veces hay que tener la conversación sobre la parte legal que va adjunta a la asistencia, pero recibirla sin
 Tener una conversación es la parte de cómo nos comunicamos.
 Para que estemos compartiendo ese sentido de pertenencia.
 Así que gracias por esos comentarios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4218.187s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Realmente, me pareció muy descriptivo de esto, de lo que siento por el distrito desde que usted tomó el mando.
 También, desde hace ocho años me pregunto: ¿qué son las escuelas comunitarias?
 Y nunca he obtenido, en mi opinión, una respuesta satisfactoria.
 Y siento que estoy empezando a comprender que, esencialmente, es solo una empresa de alquiler.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4246.366s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Lo que también proporcionaría diversión en verano.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4249.81s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Pero realmente hubiera sido mucho más fácil para mí haber escuchado esas palabras.
 Ahora que entiendo lo que es, me alegra mucho saber que se está prestando mucha atención porque
 Sé que hay algunas personas en la comunidad que no están contentas con estos cambios y creo que podemos hacerlo mejor, pero también tenemos que entender qué son, qué queremos que sean y cómo queremos apoyar a la comunidad.
 Así que estoy muy emocionado de que se esté llevando a cabo ese trabajo.
 Para las comunicaciones que giran en torno a cada uno, en torno a incidentes, es decir, las cosas cotidianas no estándar,
 ¿Tiene una revisión posterior a la acción para que cada uno de ellos determine, está bien, la comunicación no fue bien recibida o fue bien recibida y cómo podemos asegurarnos de que la próxima vez que haya un incidente de un intruso en un edificio la comunicación llegue a todas las notas de la manera correcta?
 Porque el bombardeo de
 quejas después es, ya sabes, que no creo que haya nada malo en el aluvión de gente enfadada.
 Solo quiero asegurarme, como la próxima vez que suceda, de que lo hagamos mejor.
 No necesariamente lo hacemos bien porque tú, es como una especie de práctica.
 Pero, ¿tiene una revisión posterior a la acción para cada una de estas comunicaciones relacionadas con incidentes?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4332.934s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Lo hacemos para la mayoría, no para todos, pero creo que los que
 garantizar ese nivel.
 Así lo hicimos para esa situación.
 Tuvimos más de uno en diferentes niveles.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4344.195s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Excelente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4345.336s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Sí.
 Esto es importante para nosotros para informar nuestra práctica y nuestra toma de decisiones en el futuro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4354.108s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Excelente.
 ¿Tendremos otra presentación, y tal vez ya tengamos una en el otoño, perdónenme si lo olvido, sobre la lectura y cómo nos va en eso?
 Sí.
 Porque siento que, ¿estamos en el cuarto o tercer año de renovar realmente todo esto?
 Y creo que en los primeros años fue como
 Al comprender cómo lo estábamos haciendo, bueno, los datos no estaban allí y, ya sabes, hay una cola en eso.
 Esos datos hacen que sea difícil de entender, pero me gustaría que viéramos que realmente lo estamos sacando del parque.
 Porque estábamos por delante del estado en su mayor parte en eso y en asegurarnos de que todos los niños pudieran leer al nivel de su grado.
 No hace falta que les diga que es un requisito crítico para todo lo que hacemos aquí.
 Entonces.
 Sí.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4407.735s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: mayor presentación de datos el próximo mes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4411.877s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Maravilloso.
 Y dejaré que mis colegas hagan preguntas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4416.139s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias, miembro Ruseau.
 ¿Miembro Graham?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4420.421s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Gracias.
 Sólo quería decir cuánto aprecio que todos sus comentarios sobre
 Sus logros hasta ahora y sus planes estaban alineados con lo que este grupo y lo que creo que la comunidad espera.
 Así que creo que durante demasiado tiempo tuvimos una agenda del superintendente y una agenda del comité escolar y una agenda comunitaria y todos tenían una agenda diferente y todos estábamos operando en general en una dirección, pero no realmente.
 Y creo que es importante que cuando se habla de alineación
 Usted no puede tener su propia agenda como superintendente si no coincide.
 Bien.
 Si no está conectado con lo que la comunidad espera y lo que esperamos nosotros.
 Entonces, realmente aprecié que incluso cuando establecías metas, trazabas una línea de distinción entre estas metas en las que vamos a continuar trabajando porque aún no hemos llegado a ese punto.
 Y estas son las cosas que
 Creemos que son prioridades importantes que son importantes para usted, pero también que serán como un peso en la conversación de planificación estratégica que se avecina y que usted sabe que es muy necesaria.
 Entonces sí, aprecio la conexión allí.
 Y supongo que el otro comentario es el que hemos hecho.
 Una tremenda cantidad de cambios en el último año en este distrito comenzando con los cambios en el horario.
 Y no creo que haya salido perfectamente.
 Pero también creo que, considerando todo, todo ha ido bastante bien.
 y creo
 Tener al Dr. Galusi en la mesa desde una perspectiva de negociación fue realmente importante porque realmente hablamos mucho sobre los aspectos de instrucción y el impacto de lo que estábamos pidiendo, lo que pudo haber sonado de naturaleza administrativa en ese momento, pero no lo era.
 Fue como si esto nos permitiera hacer algo diferente en términos de instrucción.
 Entonces siento que eso es realmente importante, y hay una especie de
 Incontables maneras en que el superintendente se involucra detrás de escena y cosas que el público no ve tan directamente pero entiende, pero la cola finalmente está ahí y siento que hay una gran cantidad de cosas en esa categoría para mí en las que estamos en el medio.
 Así que no creo que hayamos visto lo mejor de la programación y las clases de desafío de la escuela secundaria porque es el primer año.
 Bien.
 Pero que me pidan presentar en DESE y tener la
 El secretario de Educación y el vicegobernador vinieron aquí y pude asistir a esa presentación y hablar con ellos sobre cómo lo hemos implementado aquí versus cómo lo ven ellos implementado en otras comunidades.
 Fue una forma realmente reflexiva de facilitar parte de la programación desafiante y
 Es algo interesante ver el nivel de atención que todo esto está recibiendo en nuestro primer año, así como en nuestra primera salida, así que me quito el sombrero ante el equipo que está formando.
 Esas cosas suceden porque generalmente no recibes crédito por la implementación hasta un poco más adelante.
 Y sólo quiero comentar que todo esto ha sido el resultado de una enorme cantidad de trabajo, especialmente porque muchos puestos quedaron vacantes al principio de su mandato.
 Hubo momentos en los que eras el único en ciertos lugares y tenías que lidiar con lo que venía y estabilizar el distrito.
 Toda esa estabilización parece muy lejana.
 Sí, lo hicimos.
 Ese fue el propósito de la cita y todas esas cosas buenas.
 Pero detrás de escena, lo que se necesitó para estabilizar realmente el distrito fue
 algo más grande de lo que puedes poner en un tobogán.
 Y parece tan lejano que no creo que le hayas hecho justicia en tus comentarios.
 Pero estoy feliz de que esté en la vista trasera.
 Así que gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4687.935s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Gracias.
 Lo aprecio porque el primer día de mi nombramiento interino fue el día de las órdenes ejecutivas.
 Así que desde el principio hubo mucho trabajo y mucha comunicación.
 Ha sido todo un año.
 Agradezco a mi familia por su comprensión y apoyo.
 No precisamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4714.008s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Miembro Reinfeld y luego nuestro representante estudiantil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4718.065s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Así que gracias por esto.
 Como dijo el miembro Ruseau, esto estuvo muy, muy lleno de cosas.
 Y mientras lo analizaba, estaba pensando en esa reunión en la que muy rápidamente tuvimos que nombrar a un interino y dimos la vuelta a la mesa y dijimos, ¿qué estamos buscando?
 Y algunas personas dijeron que hay coherencia a medida que hacemos la transición hacia un nuevo liderazgo.
 Y algunas personas dijeron que tenía la capacidad de cambiar las cosas.
 con un nuevo liderazgo, y creo que esto realmente refleja ambas piezas, y aprecio el equilibrio que estamos viendo aquí, pero no solo el equilibrio de, está bien, estas son las proporciones correctas, lo hemos resuelto y vamos a seguir adelante.
 Refleja mucha reevaluación continua, que es lo que necesitamos, no solo en el lugar, en los momentos situacionales, sino realmente, ¿dónde estamos ahora como distrito?
 Entonces, lo aprecio mucho.
 Tengo una pequeña pregunta, una pregunta de seguimiento del miembro Ruseau sobre.
 Entonces creo que es importante que pensemos en eso.
 Creo que es importante que pensemos en eso.
 Creo que es importante que pensemos en eso.
 Esa seguridad de que sucedió y de que estos son los protocolos y la claridad al respecto.
 Así que creo que es un tema que es muy difícil de comunicar aquí, pero que es útil conocer en cuanto al enfoque del liderazgo allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4813.631s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 100% y creo que mucho de esa presentación puede surgir del trabajo que está haciendo el comité de seguridad del distrito.
 Y muchas de las piezas que escuchamos de los miembros del personal.
 específicamente se trataba del nivel o la falta de desarrollo profesional vinculado al protocolo I Love You Guys.
 Así que esa es en realidad una de las prioridades en la agenda del Sr. Lord.
 Y creo que ellos
 Abordamos un poco de eso en la reunión de hoy para que, a nivel escolar, hablen sobre la capacitación y el restablecimiento de las expectativas en torno a ese protocolo.
 Entonces, sí, hay ciertas piezas que, por razones de seguridad, no queremos compartir con la comunidad, pero creo que el progreso de en qué se están enfocando y trabajando esas reuniones a nivel de distrito es algo que se puede compartir al 100 por ciento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4878.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Gracias.
 Y luego creo que faltaba una pieza, no creo que la hayas mencionado, sino la contratación de un gerente de transporte.
 Realmente aprecio cómo ha estado analizando el personal y las personas que realizan múltiples trabajos y cómo se puede distribuir mejor.
 Usted habló de ello en el liderazgo central, pero creo que también está sucediendo en otros niveles.
 Oh sí.
 Lo he notado y quería comentarlo.
 Gracias por eso.
 Entonces, simplemente concluiré, porque sé que otras personas tienen cosas que decir, que al ver estos elementos de acción y este progreso presentados tal como estaban, creo que realmente ayuda a determinar qué informes necesitamos como comité para el próximo mandato, qué queremos ver, qué resoluciones necesitamos
 trabajar juntos, así que creo que sus comentarios sobre la asociación al principio son muy apreciados, y se los reflejaría, porque esto fue muy útil para comprender lo que ha estado sucediendo delante y detrás de escena, así que gracias por dedicar el tiempo.
 Sé que esto probablemente tomó mucho tiempo para armarlo además de todas estas otras cosas que en realidad están aquí, así que muchas gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4950.968s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4952.009s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias, miembro Reinfeld-Alachi, y luego creo que tenemos al miembro Olapade y al miembro Prox.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4962.113s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Gracias.
 Sé que mis compañeros del comité ya lo mencionaron, pero fue muy impresionante.
 Creo que te mantuviste concentrado, te mantuviste en todos estos innumerables temas diferentes durante tanto tiempo.
 Quiero darles un pequeño aplauso allí.
 Tengo algunas preguntas, pero quiero ser muy rápido porque sé que otros miembros todavía quieren ir.
 Entonces sé que algunos de mis otros miembros estaban hablando sobre la Revisión del Currículo de Humanidades y Salud.
 ¿Quién está a cargo del proceso de revisión para eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4997.816s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Claro, entonces el Dr. Kim Talbot es el superintendente asistente de atletismo, disculpe, para lo académico y la instrucción.
 Nuevo título ahí, ¿verdad?
 Ella ayudaría a dirigir ese trabajo, pero la directora de educación física y salud es Rachel Perry, por lo que ellas dos liderarían ese trabajo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5023.072s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Genial, gracias.
 Y no sé exactamente qué diapositiva era.
 Creo que fueron los sistemas de datos mejorados para la toma de decisiones educativas.
 Dijiste que este tipo de datos que recopilarías a través de este nuevo tipo de plataforma de análisis y demás se usarían en tiempo real para asesorar sobre instrucciones y todo eso.
 Supongo, ¿podrías dar un ejemplo de cómo quieres esto o cómo se está implementando?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5057.953s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Claro, ¿estás hablando? Lo siento mucho, Lachi, porque con el sistema de calefacción quiero asegurarme de escucharte correctamente.
 ¿Estás hablando de los arquitectos abiertos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5065.538s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Sí, solo recuerdo que dijiste, o en mis notas, que algunos de estos datos se usarían en tiempo real.
 Eso me llamó la atención, así que me preguntaba si podría dar un ejemplo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5076.184s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Claro, absolutamente.
 Así que el tiempo real podría no ser necesariamente
 en medio de una lección.
 Podría ser.
 Pero la parte en tiempo real es que no tenemos que esperar a una evaluación de fin de unidad.
 No tenemos que esperar a los grandes puntos de referencia de mitad de año, principios de año y fin de año.
 Tiempo real significa que los profesores tendrán, mediante el uso de estos paneles, el de Hill for Literacy, también esta plataforma de Open Architects, tendrán a su alcance datos que
 que utilizan constantemente y que pueden informar su planificación y su instrucción día a día o semana a semana.
 Entonces, cuando están sentados planificando para la semana, cuando están sentados planificando para el día, tienen a su disposición diferentes modos de datos.
 Y parte de eso también son datos que los maestros recopilan simplemente por
 Las respuestas de los estudiantes, solo mediante boletos de salida, indican que hay innumerables formas en que los maestros usan datos que pueden traer en tiempo real y que afectarán su planificación y su enseñanza.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5151.117s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: ¿Lo imagina más como un nivel de clase donde estos maestros ven estos datos y, ya sabes, podrían aconsejarles en qué necesitan dedicar más tiempo al plan de estudios, o es en un nivel de estudiante específico donde pueden ver que un estudiante tiene dificultades, quiere ayudar, o tal vez ambas cosas?
 Como qué es... Todo lo anterior.
 Excelente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5170.553s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Entonces es a nivel de estudiante, a nivel de clase, a nivel de departamento, a nivel de grado, a nivel de escuela.
 Todo lo anterior se debe a que los maestros lo hacen solos para asegurarse de satisfacer las necesidades de los estudiantes, pero también trabajan junto con sus compañeros para trabajar en datos de nivel de grado o datos de departamento, líderes escolares y líderes de departamento que trabajan con maestros a mayor escala.
 Realmente es para todos los niveles.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5203.812s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Genial, eso suena increíble desde la perspectiva de un maestro y un educador.
 Señor, lo siento mucho por DIBELS, hay tantas en esta diapositiva.
 Usted acaba de decir que, históricamente, han ayudado a los educadores del distrito.
 Entonces, ¿es algo similar a lo que estás hablando?
 utilizando los datos del sistema para asesorar su plan de estudios.
 Oh, DIBLS, gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5234.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: DIBL, sí.
 Gracias.
 Sí, DIBLS se utiliza para evaluar el nivel y la capacidad de lectura de los estudiantes.
 Entonces se ve diferente.
 K a dos, como de tres a cinco, también se ve diferente según cada estudiante y cuál es su propio nivel de lectura independiente.
 Dibbles se presenta como punto de referencia y como seguimiento del progreso.
 Entonces, como punto de referencia, se le da a cada estudiante al comienzo del año, a la mitad del año y al final del año.
 Eso se rastrea de alguna manera y son datos que se utilizan para informar.
 Pero algunos estudiantes requieren un seguimiento del progreso.
 No todos lo hacen, pero los estudiantes que están por debajo del nivel de grado, requieren un seguimiento de su progreso.
 Es posible que algunos estudiantes tengan que ser monitoreados.
 cada dos semanas, cada cuatro semanas.
 Otros estudiantes pueden venir solo cada seis u ocho semanas, por lo que depende del nivel de necesidad.
 Y luego este Dibbles es una evaluación rápida, es como un minuto.
 Esto también se utiliza para el seguimiento del progreso, de modo que los profesores puedan realizar un seguimiento en esos intervalos de cuál ha sido el progreso, cuál ha sido el crecimiento, para que realmente puedan centrarse en sus objetivos.
 su instrucción.
 Lo sorprendente de la plataforma Hill for Literacy que utilizamos llamada Continuum es que todos estos datos se colocan en esa plataforma.
 Y los maestros no solo tienen acceso a los datos, sino que también les ayudarán a proporcionar cuál debe ser el enfoque de instrucción para ese estudiante específico.
 Entonces los profesores tienen eso a nivel de los estudiantes.
 Y luego pueden usar esos datos para agrupar a los estudiantes según las necesidades que tienen y realmente enfocar su instrucción durante el tiempo de grupo pequeño.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5345.573s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Excelente.
 Gracias.
 Lo siento, sólo uno más.
 Y si no lo sabes desde el principio, está totalmente bien, pero cuál ha sido el perfil de costos monetarios de los arquitectos abiertos en comparación con los sistemas anteriores, o si este es un nuevo tipo de... Esa es una muy buena pregunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5369.05s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Primero, quiero comenzar solo porque preguntaste sobre Dibbles, y creo que Dibbles es clave porque Dibbles cuesta solo como un dólar por estudiante.
 En realidad, solo estás pagando por la plataforma, por lo que es muy, muy, muy rentable.
 Arquitectos abiertos, ¿siete?
 Ah, 20.
 $20,000 para acceso en todo el distrito.
 Entonces todo el personal, todos los educadores, maestros y administradores tendrán acceso a esa plataforma.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5402.482s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Comprendido.
 Gracias.
 Y nuevamente, eso fue muy impresionante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5413.51s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Gracias.
 Sólo quiero decir cuánto lo aprecio, creo,
 explicación completa y profunda que nos diste.
 Creo que cubriste bastante en muy poco tiempo.
 Algo que aprecié mucho desde el inicio de su mandato o de su gestión es la carga colectiva de pertenencia.
 Y creo que eso subraya mucho de lo que usted detalló aquí.
 Creo que la conversación sobre comunicación y asociación, la inclusión de la participación de los cuidadores, es increíblemente importante.
 Muchos de los padres con los que me he comunicado en público en los últimos meses han comunicado tanto el entusiasmo que han estado viendo en sus estudiantes al regresar a casa de clase
 Reconocer que se está volviendo cada vez más desafiante ser un padre completamente involucrado debido al costo de vida, por ejemplo, las dificultades de programación.
 Por eso, muchas veces enviamos a nuestros estudiantes a la escuela todos los días y no estamos tan comprometidos como queremos.
 Y creo que tener esta mayor comunicación con siempre margen de mejora, como usted mencionó, creo que ha sido un gran beneficio para el público y la población estudiantil en general para comprender más sobre lo que está sucediendo.
 Y creo que solo quiero poder reconocer que esta pertenencia a medida que avanzamos hacia el siguiente, los dos trimestres o trimestres restantes para una de nuestras escuelas, y luego también el próximo año académico, es para mantener esa pertenencia.
 Creo que el énfasis que realmente has destacado, así que solo quiero apreciarlo.
 Gracias.</p>

 Se ha hecho mucho y estaré observando todo detenidamente un poco más.
 Estoy aprendiendo mucho más sobre esto.
 Sin embargo, una de mis preguntas es cómo se recopilan comentarios.
 Sé que se ha mencionado mucho sobre ello.
 Ya sabes, cosas como que van bien y algunas cosas no van tan bien, tal vez el cronograma o incluso cómo se recopilan comentarios sobre arquitectos abiertos o algunos de los otros programas de desarrollo profesional y se sabe si están funcionando o si la gente los acepta o si son estudiantes o profesores o cualquier persona en realidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5532.189s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Esa es una gran pregunta.
 Oh, no estoy cerca del micrófono.
 Esa es una gran pregunta.
 Yo diría que hay
 Cuando tenemos reuniones cuando tenemos desarrollo profesional, siempre hay un boleto de salida.
 Y realmente estamos usando esos datos para estructurar y refinar la próxima sesión y estamos siendo muy intencionales.
 sobre cómo estamos respetando esa retroalimentación en los cambios que estamos haciendo en el formato de cómo hacemos las cosas.
 Creo que hemos dado muchas encuestas.
 Creo que esto habla de parte de mi mirada y la nuestra actual sobre cómo recopilamos datos.
 Ya sabes, recibimos respuestas de encuestas, pero no siempre capturan la esencia completa de Medford.
 Y ese es un trabajo continuo para nosotros.
 Siempre hay también un nivel de datos de la calle.
 Entonces, cuando te topas con gente en
 Cuando me encuentro con gente en las salidas, cuando hacemos recorridos en las escuelas, cuando asistimos a las reuniones, también se da ese nivel de retroalimentación.
 Una de las cosas que realmente hemos estado haciendo como equipo de liderazgo, un equipo de liderazgo central, es intentar crear páginas de destino y hojas de cálculo.
 para que nos brinde oportunidades de ingresar esos datos.
 Especialmente el Dr. Talbot y yo, tenemos uno en funcionamiento para que cuando escuchemos estas cosas o cuando surja algo, tengamos un lugar donde lo grabemos para poder regresar.
 Muy similar a lo que hace la administración o le gusta crear espacios de aterrizaje para que las personas sepan dónde pueden ir para obtener parte de esa información.
 Pero yo diría que parte de eso también es nuestro trabajo continuo que estamos haciendo.
 Y creo que los próximos foros son otro lugar para recopilar comentarios y aportaciones reales de la gente en persona.
 Sé que también se enviará una encuesta, pero recopilé muchos datos muy importantes durante el encuentro y los saludos.
 y cuando participamos en los comités y el grupo de trabajo.
 Pero nuevamente, en realidad es solo esa parte de cómo nos aseguramos de que sean todas voces.
 Y ese es el trabajo que aún queda por hacer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5703.254s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias.

 Brevemente, Superintendente.
 Excelente primera reunión para mí y estoy muy feliz de poder ponerme al día con todo el trabajo que usted y especialmente el equipo de liderazgo han estado haciendo.
 Tres cosas que me llamaron la atención: está claro que se están realizando muchos cambios y mejoras organizacionales.
 Es un trabajo duro que lleva mucho tiempo y es realmente genial verlo.
 Eso se reflejó mucho en el trabajo que quieres compartir con nosotros.
 En segundo lugar, la idea de apoyar el desarrollo curricular, ayudar a nuestros educadores a no tener que tomarse el tiempo para desarrollar el plan de estudios, sino centrarse realmente en cómo lo presentan y tratar de establecer esa conexión.
 Ése es un verdadero multiplicador de fuerza.
 Y nuevamente, algo por lo que realmente quiero darle crédito a usted y a su equipo.
 Eso es algo fantástico.
 Y finalmente, algo cercano y querido para mi corazón son las escuelas comunitarias.
 Es un recurso tan comunitario.
 Y como administradores y administradores de esos lugares, creo que tenemos que lograr un equilibrio entre la equidad generacional de
 permitiendo apoyar a los usuarios ahora mismo y poder mantener esos activos para los usuarios en el futuro dentro de 10, 20, 30 años.
 Así que tengo muchas ganas de ver lo que su equipo nos traerá para hablar sobre cómo será el futuro de las escuelas comunitarias.
 Pero muchas gracias por la presentación.</p>

 Justo antes de salir de este tema quería asegurarme de que para la comunidad tengamos claro cuáles son los próximos pasos en términos de la evaluación del superintendente.
 Así que dejaré que el miembro Olapade nos diga eso.
 Pero creo que mi pregunta.
 También para fines de planificación similares en torno a temas de MSBA, ¿todavía estamos en camino de tener una evaluación para revisar juntos en la reunión del día 26?
 ¿Y necesita ayuda de este comité?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5839.358s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Esa es una gran pregunta.
 Eso se comunicará a los miembros de los que hablamos.
 Entonces soy miembro del foro en Tapa.
 Soy miembro del foro en Branley.
 no los miembros más nuevos del comité.
 Esto saldrá mañana por la mañana para que cada uno de nosotros, ahora que hemos recibido la evaluación del superintendente, podamos recopilar nuestros pensamientos y nuestros deseos para que la comunidad sea conocida.
 Y luego tomaré esos datos y los compilaré en un mensaje conciso.
 Quiero que quede claro para el público que lo que leeré es una combinación de todos los pensamientos y revisiones de opiniones de,
 Miembros establecidos de la reunión anterior, por lo que no será palabra por palabra de cada miembro a menos que un miembro sienta que es necesario decir algo, pero en general ese no es el estándar o no es el modelo que seguimos, pero estará listo para el día 26.
 creo que es la reunion</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5896.888s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Si me lo permiten desde la silla, solo para llevarlo a cuestas, lo recibiremos mañana por la mañana y luego, ¿cuándo deberíamos entregárselo para que lo recopile?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5903.552s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Preferiblemente, ¿lo tendré antes del domingo, domingo 18?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5912.096s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Sí, eso me da aproximadamente una semana de tiempo para recopilar toda la información.
 No quiero presionar más porque queremos finalizar esa revisión en público antes de que MSBA sea el siguiente paso.</p>

 Me preguntaba, porque mencionaste cómo estás fortaleciendo los modos de comunicación existentes, especialmente con los padres.
 Me preguntaba qué trabajo se ha hecho para diversificar la comunicación, especialmente porque tenía curiosidad, así que eché un vistazo en línea y realmente no hay mucho fuera del sitio web de la escuela en términos de comunicación orientada al futuro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5961.114s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Esa es una gran pregunta.
 Gran parte de esto se realiza en colaboración con mi director de comunicaciones, Will Pippicelli.
 Por eso mantenemos el sitio web.
 Hemos actualizado nuestra web.
 Continuamos actualizando nuestro sitio web para asegurarnos de que brinde a las familias de la comunidad la mejor información posible.
 Cuando enviamos algo, estamos enviando nuestras comunicaciones.
 a través de la plataforma en la que se encuentra el sitio web llamada FinalSight.

 Miembro Ruseau, y luego pasaremos al calendario escolar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6055.204s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias.
 Pero esa era una pregunta, es decir, ya sabes,
 Con el fin de los periódicos, ya no hay un lugar al que todos vayan.
 Y es como si vas a Facebook, Medford Politics tiene 2.000 personas, la mayoría de las cuales probablemente viven en Medford.
 Y podrían creer que se están comunicando con Medford cuando están allí y que se están comunicando con algo de Medford.
 Y creo que es un desafío, creo que hay sectores enteros de la ciudad para los cuales no hay otra vía de comunicación que tocar a su puerta o enviarles algo por correo.
 Ambos son tremendamente caros, obviamente.
 Y creo que es una situación triste en la que nos encontramos, especialmente cuando hablamos de una nueva escuela secundaria.
 Cuando hablamos de una nueva escuela secundaria, ya sabes, no vamos a poder publicar artículos de opinión en los periódicos y pensar que estamos afectando a la mayoría de los votantes.
 Así que es un verdadero desafío de nuestro tiempo.
 Y no envidio a nuestro grupo de comunicaciones.
 Así que gracias por esa pregunta.
 Eso es realmente importante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6126.908s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias, miembro Ruseau.
 Y gracias de nuevo, Dr. Galusi.
 A continuación, tenemos nuestra recomendación de aprobar el calendario distrital del año escolar 26-27.
 Se lo paso a usted, Dr. Galusi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6141.815s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Entonces no lo sé, Sr. Pippicelli, ¿verdad?
 Él es tan bueno.
 Gracias.
 Así que dedicamos un rato a hablar del calendario para el próximo año.
 Lo que estamos aquí para proponer como recomendación es esta opción para el calendario escolar el próximo año.
 Algunas cosas a tener en cuenta mientras encuadro esto para el año escolar 26-27, el Día del Trabajo es muy tarde.
 El Día del Trabajo, como puede ver aquí, es el 7 de septiembre, lo que significa que, según los contratos,
 volver a la escuela la semana anterior.
 En realidad, eso es para el próximo año, la primera semana de septiembre.
 Normalmente en un año, esa semana de regreso es la última semana de agosto.
 El año que viene, sería la primera semana de septiembre.
 Además, el día de la votación primaria es el martes 1 de septiembre.
 Entonces, lo que brindamos aquí es solo una recomendación para seguir prácticamente la misma estructura que tenemos este año para que los maestros regresen y tengan sus días de desarrollo profesional, el lanzamiento el lunes 31 de agosto y el 1 de septiembre, y les damos la bienvenida a los estudiantes de los grados uno al 12 el 2 de septiembre.
 Esto hace,
 sin días de nieve, el último día de clases el 23 de junio.
 Entonces, si tenemos un día de nieve, tendríamos que agregarlo después del 23 de junio.
 También quiero ser muy transparente, como ya lo hemos discutido.
 El año pasado, cuando se presentó el calendario, por la forma en que caían algunos días festivos,
 Hubo una recomendación de honrar los días festivos más importantes con fines religiosos, pero no quiero decir menos, pero a falta de una palabra mejor, no son días santos tan importantes a los que asistir.
 Que estamos adoptando un enfoque similar al del próximo año.
 Pero sí quiero señalar que históricamente hasta este año, las Escuelas Públicas de Medford tenían libre el Viernes Santo.
 Y este es el primer año.
 que es un día de escuela y no un día libre.
 Por eso, esta propuesta de calendario para el próximo año también incluye el Viernes Santo como día de clases.
 Espero que estemos bien, pero tampoco lo hemos hecho.
 como lo experimenté ese día todavía.
 Por eso espero que no nos obstaculicemos como un problema de personal.
 Sólo quiero ser totalmente transparente en cuanto a que se está proponiendo este calendario, pero es posible que justifique una mayor conversación en algún momento después de que veamos qué sucede con ese día este año.
 Y aparte de eso, la única parte de esto es que hay una regulación DESI sobre cuándo puede realizarse la graduación y la distancia entre la graduación de la escuela secundaria y el último día de clases para el distrito.
 Y no pueden ser más de 12.
 Esto significa que el próximo año, para la promoción de 2027, la graduación, lo más pronto posible sería el viernes 4 de junio.
 Entonces tendríamos que trasladarlo del miércoles al viernes de conformidad con las normas DESI.
 Aparte de eso, seguimos prácticamente la misma estructura que este año.
 Esto fue revisado con el sindicato docente durante el trabajo conjunto.
 Y hoy tuve una conversación con el presidente del sindicato, Anthony Guillén.
 Y esta opción cumple plenamente con el convenio colectivo, por lo que, por supuesto, la apoyan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6405.45s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Feliz de responder cualquier pregunta.
 Gracias, doctor Galussi.
 Y creo que hoy leímos que quieren tener una sesión de aportes más.
 Entonces, ¿está pidiendo una votación para presentar la mesa o está buscando aprobación?
 No, estoy buscando aprobación.
 Bueno.
 Tuve una conversación.
 Miembro Ruseau, luego miembro Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6426.085s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias.
 Solo quiero decir que aprobamos esta política en 2020, y este es el primer año en que se presentó el calendario que era preciso, así que quiero agradecerles.
 En realidad, no es una tarea fácil, porque dices, ya sabes, quiero ver las fechas de 2026, y es como, oh, pero necesito 2027 para algunas de ellas, pero 2026 para las que son posteriores al 1 de septiembre, así que es un poco,
 tedioso y confuso a veces.
 Y tomo nuestra política y tomo el calendario propuesto y lo reviso y, ya sabes, le pregunto a Chat GPT cuándo es la fecha de ese año.
 E incluso yo, después de pasar por eso, cometí un par de errores y casi te envío un mensaje de texto diciendo que no está bien otra vez.
 Pero no lo hice porque entonces me di cuenta de que estaba mirando el año equivocado.
 Así que aprecio que eso sea correcto.
 Y, quiero decir, realmente, francamente, tuvimos mucha suerte este año, ya que muchos días festivos fueron el sábado, muchos días festivos religiosos para los que no tenemos escuela fueron el sábado o, bueno, francamente, muchos sábados y domingos.
 Entonces, desde la perspectiva de un día escolar, tuvimos mucha suerte.
 El año pasado tuvimos mucha mala suerte.
 Así que me alegro de que no tuviéramos que hacer eso.
 ¿Había algo más que quisiera decir sobre esto?
 No, sólo quería hacer una moción para aprobar la opción A tal como se presentó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6520.045s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Solo tenía una pregunta rápida.
 Entonces, el final del último día de clases es el 23 de junio, ¿tengo razón en que DESE requiere que tengamos espacio para cinco días de nieve y, por lo tanto, cumplimos con esto?</p>

 Miembro Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6590.903s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Thank you.
 I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.
 So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.
 So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.
 We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.
 But they already were on board and working.
 And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can
 And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?
 So what happens today?
 How does it happen?
 Where is the ledge?
 Where is the playing field?
 How does traffic flow?
 Where are the challenges?
 And all of that good stuff.
 So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to
 And I think that's a really good question.
 I think that's a really good question.
 And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.
 So they've been doing all of that work.
 They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.
 So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.
 They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.
 There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.
 All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.
 At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.
 That work has been really interesting to watch.
 So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.
 So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.
 And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.
 And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.
 What do you do?
 How do you do it?
 Where do you do it?
 All of that good stuff.
 So all of that happened.
 That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.
 Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.
 So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?
 So it's very educationally focused.
 It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having
 grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.
 So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.
 It started with a shadow day and
 Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.
 Arrival, lunch, passing periods.
 like all of it.
 Right.
 So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.
 He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.
 I think they saw four schools in a day.
 Is that right.
 To help our team understand what's possible.
 Right.
 Because many people
 have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.
 So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.
 So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.
 Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,
 and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.
 And I got to be part of that two-day session.
 And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.
 And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.
 And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.
 So he was super skillful and artful.
 just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.
 So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.
 So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like
 The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.
 what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?
 And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.
 And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.
 But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate
 What are we going to do in the building?
 And how are we going to do it?
 And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.
 And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.
 Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?
 And is it an open space or a closed space?
 That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is
 a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.
 Like why do you need a new space, right?
 So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.
 And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.
 And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.
 And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.
 And then we have this set of sessions.
 And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?
 And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.
 And
 She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.
 And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.
 And we're like, fair, right?
 Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.
 But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.
 And we were like, why?
 Why wouldn't you do it there?
 And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.
 And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,
 maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.
 Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?
 I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?
 Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?
 And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,
 like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say
 do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?
 And the answer is like, absolutely not.
 Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.
 So out of all of that will come an educational plan.
 And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.
 So we'll be introducing it then.
 So SMMA will be here with us.
 We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.
 But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,
 is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.
 Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.
 And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.
 So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.
 Preliminary design plan.
 And that PDP includes the educational plan.
 That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.
 And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space
 concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.
 That work is for the building committee to do.
 So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.
 But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.
 So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.
 And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from
 Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.
 The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.
 Where will the building go and what will it look like?
 Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?
 So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.
 So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.
 so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?
 So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.
 And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.
 lots of chances for community input in those sessions.
 So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.
 And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.
 So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.
 Translation services will be available.
 We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.
 They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks
 Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.
 And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.
 We'll collect a lot of questions.
 We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.
 And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.
 And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.
 And there'll be a place for public input.
 And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.
 We're working on plans for that.
 Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.
 So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.
 And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?
 Like the building could be here, it could be there.
 That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.
 So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?
 How many classrooms is it?
 that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,
 And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.
 That's why the ed plan is so important.
 So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.
 And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.
 And that's false.
 It's almost completely false.
 I think there's one program where that is true.
 And it's like a marginal change.
 In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.
 So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.
 It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan
 is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?
 One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.
 They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.
 And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.
 What's the other one?
 Fitness center.
 So, and it's not like marginally bigger.
 What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.
 So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.
 So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think
 part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.
 But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.
 It's been a lot of really not glorious,
 And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not
 the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.
 They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.
 So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.
 But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.
 So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.
 So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.
 Let's see, where'd it go?
 Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.
 I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.
 And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.
 One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.
 And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.
 And to create a higher quality,
 video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.
 None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.
 So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.
 On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.
 This is where we're going to start to see concepts.
 This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.
 And then we will
 Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.
 we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.
 The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.
 We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.
 Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.
 On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.
 On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.
 So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.
 All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.
 There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.
 And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.
 That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.
 By June we will have one.
 So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish
 How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?
 So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.
 But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.
 Tell us what you think about them.
 So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.
 And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.
 where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.
 So that's the next three months of this project.
 So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?
 No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.
 and cost.
 So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.
 We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized
 doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.
 There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.
 There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.
 But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.
 So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.
 But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8120.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Miembro Reinfeld.
 Gracias.
 Esto es súper emocionante.
 Sí, finalmente.
 Sí.
 Estoy muy entusiasmado con esto.
 Bueno, mi primera pregunta es: ¿podemos tomar prestado algo de esa sesión de visión para nuestras reuniones de planificación estratégica?
 Porque eso suena increíble.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8136.725s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Fue realmente maravilloso.
 Y creo que algunas personas en la sala dijeron: tenemos que hacer esto con todos los profesores de la escuela secundaria.
 Y entonces había mucha energía en torno a lo que podría suceder.
 Y creo que uno de los reconocimientos y Mike,
 quién es el jefe de la organización, dijo, ya sabes, cuando escuchas historias sobre escuelas que construyeron algo y luego no lo usan, ¿verdad?
 Escuchas eso todo el tiempo.
 Y dijo que eso pasa porque
 la gente hace una lista de sus esperanzas, sueños y deseos.
 Y dicen: "Será fantástico si podemos tener estas cosas".
 Y luego todos cierran la lista de esperanzas, sueños y deseos y esperan que llegue el edificio.
 y una especie de esperanza de que el edificio los transforme.
 Y el edificio no va a hacer eso.
 La transformación tiene que ocurrir por parte de las personas, porque las cosas que tienen que cambiar en realidad son las personas, ¿verdad?
 Así que hablamos un poco sobre
 Una vez que hayamos desarrollado este plan educativo inicial, ¿qué tipo de oportunidades de desarrollo profesional y sesiones de colaboración deberían realizarse para comenzar realmente a desarrollarse de manera colaborativa?
 ¿Qué podemos hacer antes de que se abra este edificio?
 ¿Y cuándo podremos hacer esas cosas?
 y qué apoyos se necesitan.
 Y ese es otro trabajo que hace este equipo del planificador educativo.
 Y ciertamente dije: "Estaré feliz de poder darte sugerencias".
 Estaré feliz de poder decirte cómo hacerlo tú mismo.
 Estoy feliz de poder ayudarte a hacerlo.
 Pero sí, creo que va al grano, como el trabajo que hizo para desposicionar a todos de lo que sea que pensaban que venían a decirnos,
 Es importante y es un trabajo hábil, por lo que creo que es importante pensar realmente en los próximos pasos.
 Creo que usaremos muchas de las mismas técnicas en nuestras sesiones de planificación estratégica, aunque tenemos una audiencia un poco menos controlada, así que navegaremos hacia eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8273.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Eso fue bastante curado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8275.047s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí, sí.
 Sí, y creo que cuando tienes una audiencia seleccionada, realmente puedes dirigir, y también intentaremos hacer nuestras sesiones de planificación estratégica en dos horas.
 Tuvimos dos días.
 Así que tendremos que movernos un poco diferente, pero muchos de los mismos Conceptos similares se aplicarán con seguridad.
 Sí, desearía que hubiera una manera en que la gente pudiera capturar eso y compartirlo en viñetas de alguna manera. Sí, y creo que, según tu punto, una de las cosas de las que podemos hablar es cómo capturamos eso porque creo que fue realmente
 Es genial lo que pasó y creo que tal vez haya una oportunidad de hacer eso de la que podamos hablar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8311.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, solo estoy pensando que mis hijos no estaban en eso, pero he estado recibiendo mensajes de texto desde hoy. Era que en la escuela secundaria hace más frío que afuera y el otro día le enseñé a un arquitecto cómo hacer una trenza francesa.
 Entonces, es realmente maravilloso ver a este estudiante centrado.
 Entonces, creo que la mayoría de mis otras preguntas ahora tienen que ver con esta comunicación a la comunidad.
 De hecho, estoy muy contento de que Simon haya planteado esta idea, esta cuestión de comunicarse con personas más allá de la comunidad escolar.
 Tenemos muchas estrategias para hacer esto y, de hecho, me encantaría.
 Me encantaría difundir esta información sobre el foro, ya sea a través de puntos de conversación o correos electrónicos a través de las escuelas.
 Sé que eso no necesariamente se aplica a la comunidad de Medford en general, pero estoy pensando, estoy mirando a todos los directores de primaria aquí en la audiencia, pero estos son los estudiantes que vivirán en este edificio y también en la escuela secundaria.
 Entonces, sería genial enviar ese aviso antes del miércoles, pero me pregunto si podemos preparar algún tipo de volante de mochila en estas fechas con el descargo de responsabilidad, sujeto al clima de Nueva Inglaterra y todo eso, y aquí se explica cómo suscribirse, si se publicará un boletín informativo, aquí se explica cómo mantenerse informado sobre este proyecto, si pudiéramos enviar algo físico a las familias pronto, sería realmente</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8399.811s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí, hay un par de cosas que también se están gestando allí.
 Le enviaremos un recordatorio.
 Will ha estado en contacto con Steve en la oficina del alcalde para informarle sobre esta reunión.
 Excelente.
 Los enlaces comunitarios comunicarán sobre esta reunión a sus comunidades que necesitan servicios de traducción.
 Y luego, mientras hablamos de fechas importantes, la otra cosa de la que hablamos hoy con los enlaces comunitarios fue cómo darle a la gente esa lista exacta de lo que está por venir.
 Entonces, cuando lo juntamos, podemos hacer muchas cosas con él, incluso rellenar algunos folletos y mochilas.
 Entonces la comunicación sobre la reunión se ha realizado de dos maneras diferentes.
 Enviaremos un recordatorio, pero luego podemos poner esto como,
 como Trail of Breadcrumbs, una especie de programa de reuniones para personas en mochilas para nuestros estudiantes de primaria y también para impulsarlo a través de todos estos canales.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8457.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Porque creo que lograrlo a través de la escuela puede involucrar a algunas de nuestras familias que
 con el debido respeto puede que no sigan tan de cerca el memorando semanal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8466.62s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí.
 Creo que la otra cosa de la que hablaremos es cómo crear un boletín informativo de lista de correo que pueda usarse para comunicaciones más amplias fuera de la comunidad escolar para que aquellas personas de la comunidad que quieran recibir notificaciones explícitas sobre las cosas en el comité de construcción que lo harán.
 Entonces tenemos un montón de cosas orientadas a la comunicación que
 Empezaremos a ponernos en marcha para poder crear una base más grande de personas informadas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8496.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Excelente.
 Y creo que mi última pregunta fue sobre eso.
 Sé que cuando empezaste había un subcomité de comunicaciones y participación comunitaria y simplemente nos asegurábamos de que siguiera activo y sólido.
 Y si hay algo de lo que este cuerpo sé la mitad
 Una buena mitad de la gente, bueno, hay más personas en esta sala en ese comité que las que no.
 Ha estado en varios comités de construcción en Somerville y es gerente de proyectos de instalaciones.
 Creo que soy la única persona aquí que no está involucrada en obras de construcción.
 Pero todo lo que podamos hacer para apoyar a ese comité a hacer correr la voz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8530.081s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí.
 Ese subcomité no se ha reunido desde hace un tiempo porque hemos centrado nuestra atención en todo el trabajo sobre las condiciones existentes.
 Pero creo que existe una oportunidad de volver a convocar a ese equipo y hablaré con los miembros de ese equipo sobre hacer algo que pueda publicarse como tal vez un boletín mensual o algo que pueda ser escrito por un subconjunto del comité de construcción.
 Entonces hablaremos de eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8554.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Eso sería genial.
 Mi objetivo aquí es que nadie se sorprenda cuando aparezca la exclusión de la deuda.
 Oh, absolutamente.
 Lo siento.
 Punto justo.
 Vamos a esforzarnos mucho para conseguir a todos.
 O cuando se sorprenden al saber adónde ir para obtener más información.
 Así que gracias por todo el trabajo.
 Y gracias a todos los que han estado haciendo este trabajo, porque sé que es mucho.
 Y estoy muy emocionado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8582.266s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias.
 Tienes que decir algunas palabras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8589.509s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: Gracias de nuevo, Simón Alcindor, calle Tainter 44.
 Solo tenía un par de preguntas rápidas.
 En primer lugar, sé que mencionaste brevemente el transporte cuando hablabas de la fase exploratoria de esto.
 ¿Tiene más detalles sobre lo que han estado haciendo exactamente, especialmente en lo que respecta al tráfico, ya que es una especie de lugar aislado?
 Estoy algo interesado en eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8612.321s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí, eso surgió de dos maneras diferentes.
 Además de todas las cosas de las que hablé, olvidé mencionar que tenemos cuatro comités asesores.
 Hay alrededor de 70 personas en los cuatro comités hablando sobre quiénes son miembros de la comunidad que se unen a nosotros en una capacidad específica.
 Y uno de esos subcomités se ocupa de la seguridad del sitio.
 Y el tema del transporte surgió en esa reunión justo antes de las vacaciones.
 Entonces, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo sobre el transporte son algunas cosas.
 Uno es sobre la naturaleza de una entrada y una salida de dónde está nuestra escuela.
 Y hablando de eso, escuchamos del jefe, del jefe de policía en particular, que el acceso de emergencia es algo que debemos explorar, y el equipo está hablando de eso.
 También estamos hablando de crear un mejor flujo de tráfico alrededor del edificio, dondequiera que esté ubicado.
 Entonces una de las cosas que comentaron los arquitectos es que
 La forma en que está distribuida la propiedad ahora prioriza los estacionamientos sobre el flujo.
 Muchos de los problemas que tenemos se pueden aliviar prestando atención al flujo alrededor de la propiedad.
 El ejemplo que surgió en nuestra sesión de visión fue que los estudiantes decían:
 Intento salir de mi última clase unos minutos antes porque tengo que llegar al autobús y está al otro lado del edificio de la escuela y si no llego entonces no consigo asiento o no puedo subir al autobús porque está lleno, ¿no?
 Y dicen, y por cierto, eso es lo mismo, todos salen por la misma salida, ¿verdad?
 Entonces, si te recogen en un automóvil, si te recogen en un autobús, si caminas a casa, todos salen por la misma salida.
 Es una locura, ¿verdad?
 Y entonces dijeron: ¿pueden los autobuses estar en otro lugar?
 Eso fue como preguntan los estudiantes.
 ¿Podemos simplemente poner los autobuses en otro lugar?
 Y la respuesta en nuestra propiedad actual es, en realidad, no.
 Pero en un edificio nuevo donde pensamos, bueno, ¿cómo llega la gente a esta escuela?
 Como que llegan a pie.
 Por cierto, es un terreno muy empinado, ¿verdad?
 Entonces, si vas a llegar en bicicleta, es un tramo muy empinado para subir esa colina.
 Y no soy motociclista, pero no podría hacerlo.
 Entonces, ¿a cuántas personas estamos disuadiendo?
 Porque hay un tono muy pronunciado, ¿y hay una respuesta para eso?
 Pero también, ¿cómo hacemos para que no todos nos reunamos en el mismo punto de estrangulamiento, esencialmente, que es lo que sucede hoy?
 Entonces, todo eso se está discutiendo e incluso han surgido cosas como que probablemente necesitemos hablar con la MBTA sobre el horario de los autobuses y si hay algún cambio que se pueda hacer para crear un mejor acceso.
 Y sabes que cuando empiezas a hablar de ese tipo de cosas, los estudiantes, con razón, dirán que no hay ningún autobús que llegue tarde.
 Entonces, si lo intento, uno de los estudiantes me dijo que me esforzaría por quedarme para no quedarme después de la escuela porque si me quedo después de la escuela tengo que caminar dos millas hasta casa.
 y me lleva una hora.
 Entonces porque no hay ningún autobús que llegue tarde.
 Entonces, en estas sesiones surgen muchas cosas que no tienen, como que un autobús llega tarde, no tiene nada que ver con si este edificio es viejo o nuevo, sino que surge en el contexto del problema colectivo que necesitamos resolver.
 Entonces, sí, se está conversando mucho sobre el transporte y estoy emocionado de ver cómo fluye.
 Cada vez que doy la vuelta a la esquina trasera de esa curva cerrada, pienso:
 ¿Quién hizo esto?
 ¿Por qué está tan apretado?
 Apenas puedo mover mi auto gigante por allí, y mucho menos dos autos.
 Así que ese es el tipo de cosas.
 Y luego, si piensas si vas a ir...
 Lo hace, lo hace.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8850.138s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Esos dardos de autobús pueden hacer un milagro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8852.42s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Pero si vas por la parte trasera del edificio para dejar a un niño en el campo, tienes que dar la vuelta y regresar por donde viniste.
 Entonces, ese es el tipo de conversaciones fluidas que realmente espero que se alivien de manera significativa cuando comencemos a hablar sobre cómo podría diseñarse este nuevo edificio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8874.665s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: Y luego, por separado, ¿las reuniones del comité se realizarán según el calendario de eventos de la ciudad y eso?
 Sí.
 Porque me di cuenta de que son, al menos no el del miércoles, ¿verdad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8886.248s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correcto.
 Aún no.
 Es un trabajo en progreso.
 Así que las vacaciones se han salido con la suya.
 Will ha estado poniendo todas esas cosas en el calendario de MPS y lo ha compartido con la ciudad para que ellos también puedan estar allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8897.411s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: Bueno.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8898.192s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí.
 En cualquier momento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8899.732s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Muchas gracias.
 Gracias, miembro Graham, por la actualización.

 Nos saltaremos también continuar con los negocios, los nuevos negocios, los informes solicitados y pasaré directamente a las condolencias.
 Los miembros.
 ¿Quieres decir eso simplemente para que el público pueda oír?
 Gracias.</p>
