00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:30,679

00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could call the roll for the resolution.

30
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:47,186
[SPEAKER_04]: The resolution or the roll call?

00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the roll call is later.

[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:21,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Mastropoulos?

55
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to help me with your last name better soon.

56
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:28,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olopade.

00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

58
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:30,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Parks.

59
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

60
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rheinfeld.

61
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:32,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

62
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau.

63
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

64
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo.

65
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:35,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

66
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:37,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven present.

67
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to our student rep for joining us tonight.

68
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,271
[SPEAKER_02]: If we all may rise to salute the flag, please.

69
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:54,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

70
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:01,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any agenda items from anybody on good of the order?

71
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

72
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:13,439
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason that I have to abstain from votes tonight, member Lopate is in the same vote as I am, is that we missed the 430 window to come be officially sworn in.

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can be here, we can be present, we can be part of the conversation, we just can't vote.

74
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

75
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:18,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

80
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the floor?

81
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:42,489

[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Rousseau is yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: And Mayor Langel-Kern.

100
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two abstain, and I think I might have said your name wrong, I'm sorry.

101
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:33,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you?

102
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:33,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Mastroboni.

103
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Mastroboni.

104
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

105
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:36,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Mastro.

106
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:37,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Mastro.

107
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

108
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

109
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:41,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Four syllables.

110
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:50,339
[SPEAKER_02]: No reports of subcommittees, and we have three reports of our superintendent, so I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne Begalusi, our interim superintendent.

111
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,800
[SPEAKER_02]: First up is the interim superintendent's evaluations and goals.

112
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

113
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:01,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

114
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:15,386
[SPEAKER_11]: So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.

115
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:27,189
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.

116
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.

117
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:47,345
[SPEAKER_11]: My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.

118
00:05:48,810 --> 00:06:01,353
[SPEAKER_11]: None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.

119
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:07,594
[SPEAKER_11]: A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.

120
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,655
[SPEAKER_11]: This work is very demanding and it is very complex.

121
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:14,117
[SPEAKER_11]: and it keeps you on your toes.

122
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:20,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.

123
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is work that you take home with you.

124
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:24,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet it is carried out.

125
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:30,783
[SPEAKER_11]: in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.

126
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:38,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.

127
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:44,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.

128
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:50,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.

129
00:06:51,140 --> 00:07:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.

130
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:07,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,381
[SPEAKER_11]: The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.

132
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:21,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.

133
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:26,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.

134
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,106
[SPEAKER_11]: On the next slide, please.

135
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:37,044
[SPEAKER_11]: What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.

136
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:42,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.

137
00:07:44,531 --> 00:08:05,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

138
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:09,777
[SPEAKER_11]: During that time, we began to work

139
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,987
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot on our instructional excellence.

140
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:22,432
[SPEAKER_11]: We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.

141
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:28,235
[SPEAKER_11]: That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.

142
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:39,060
[SPEAKER_11]: You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.

143
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:47,120
[SPEAKER_11]: creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.

144
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:56,024
[SPEAKER_11]: It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.

145
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:03,988
[SPEAKER_11]: As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.

146
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:08,810
[SPEAKER_11]: This spoke about the work that I had done really working on

147
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:27,541
[SPEAKER_11]: the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.

148
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,743
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that to bring with me to this position.

149
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,425
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could please go to the next slide.

150
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:48,630
[SPEAKER_11]: This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.

151
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.

152
00:09:53,073 --> 00:10:03,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.

153
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence

154
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:11,347
[SPEAKER_11]: through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.

155
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:19,715
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.

156
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So to begin, our core values

157
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,259
[SPEAKER_11]: were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.

158
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:52,342
[SPEAKER_11]: They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.

159
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:56,562
[SPEAKER_11]: These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.

160
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is collaborative effort.

161
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,395
[SPEAKER_11]: and input put into the core values.

162
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

163
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:17,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.

164
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:24,569
[SPEAKER_11]: We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.

165
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.

166
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:35,145
[SPEAKER_11]: So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.

167
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:36,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Who are we?

168
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:38,507
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we lead?

169
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,468
[SPEAKER_11]: What we expect?

170
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do we communicate?

171
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

172
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:53,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.

173
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,598
[SPEAKER_11]: When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,

174
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:09,041
[SPEAKER_11]: a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.

175
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:17,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.

176
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:26,170
[SPEAKER_11]: uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.

177
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:37,253
[SPEAKER_11]: My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.

178
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,594
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the work that really began.

179
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:47,115
[SPEAKER_11]: It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.

180
00:12:48,950 --> 00:13:02,143
[SPEAKER_11]: When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.

181
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:08,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.

182
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,544
[SPEAKER_11]: This slide talks about that.

183
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:26,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.

184
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:35,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.

185
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:49,158
[SPEAKER_11]: and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.

186
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:53,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.

187
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,722
[SPEAKER_11]: It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.

188
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,563
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that is

189
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:04,836
[SPEAKER_11]: still growing.

190
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:09,369
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.

191
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.

192
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,141
[SPEAKER_11]: We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.

193
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:39,403
[SPEAKER_11]: They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.

194
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:49,229
[SPEAKER_11]: We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.

195
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:59,817
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.

196
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:16,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.

197
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:25,237
[SPEAKER_11]: This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful

198
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,041
[SPEAKER_11]: negotiations with the teachers.

199
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:34,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.

200
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:45,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.

201
00:15:46,099 --> 00:16:05,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.

202
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:15,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,

203
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:20,641
[SPEAKER_11]: That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.

204
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:34,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.

205
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:42,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.

206
00:16:43,684 --> 00:17:08,059
[SPEAKER_11]: This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.

207
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It also brought us recognition and a highlight

208
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:25,664
[SPEAKER_11]: from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.

209
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:41,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,

210
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:52,128
[SPEAKER_11]: on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.

211
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:05,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.

212
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:22,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.

213
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:28,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.

214
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,907
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think it's important to note we've had a big

215
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:38,262
[SPEAKER_11]: reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.

216
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:53,037
[SPEAKER_11]: My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.

217
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:54,759
[SPEAKER_11]: They're bringing with them years of

218
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:09,924
[SPEAKER_11]: experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.

219
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,406
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, I was very intentional.

220
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:19,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.

221
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:28,912
[SPEAKER_11]: and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.

222
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:35,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in

223
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,721
[SPEAKER_11]: her permanent position.

224
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:43,627
[SPEAKER_11]: We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.

225
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,431
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really helped to stabilize the district.

226
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:50,094
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.

227
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:53,357
[SPEAKER_11]: But they also started mid to late August.

228
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:59,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are still in the stages of building

229
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,357
[SPEAKER_11]: what we know we need to do.

230
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:07,700
[SPEAKER_11]: A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.

231
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:15,965
[SPEAKER_11]: The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.

232
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:22,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.

233
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:32,403
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.

234
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:36,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,

235
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:47,123
[SPEAKER_11]: is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.

236
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:57,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.

237
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:08,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Rousseau in all of the bargaining units.

238
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:11,356
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a significant amount of work done last year.

239
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,557
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still going with some other units.

240
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:25,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.

241
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:33,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So, strengthening operational foundations.

242
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:40,003
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.

243
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:49,710
[SPEAKER_11]: For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.

244
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:58,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.

245
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:17,928
[SPEAKER_11]: On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.

246
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:31,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.

247
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:38,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.

248
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,796
[SPEAKER_11]: in the short time he's been here so far.

249
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.

250
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,279
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.

251
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,620
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been part of ongoing conversations.

252
00:22:54,001 --> 00:23:08,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.

253
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:13,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.

254
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:19,186
[SPEAKER_11]: That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.

255
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:29,351
[SPEAKER_11]: The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.

256
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:32,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Heating and roof leaks.

257
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,614
[SPEAKER_11]: par for the course in the past year.

258
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:40,276
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.

259
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:46,639
[SPEAKER_11]: We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.

260
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.

261
00:23:55,343 --> 00:23:59,905
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.

262
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:09,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.

263
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:14,404
[SPEAKER_11]: To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered

264
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,614
[SPEAKER_11]: speedily through Amazon.

265
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:30,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.

266
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
[SPEAKER_11]: But you just don't know what's going to happen.

267
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:41,183
[SPEAKER_11]: And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.

268
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:46,230
[SPEAKER_11]: The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.

269
00:24:46,730 --> 00:25:00,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.

270
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Strengthening safety.

271
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:11,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.

272
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:25,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.

273
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,964
[SPEAKER_11]: What that has looked like is an update.

274
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:36,315
[SPEAKER_11]: and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.

275
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:43,922
[SPEAKER_11]: This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.

276
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:47,138
[SPEAKER_11]: to mostly fruition.

277
00:25:48,439 --> 00:26:02,398
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their

278
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,220
[SPEAKER_11]: ability to come in and out of work.

279
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,241
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.

280
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:12,283
[SPEAKER_11]: School-based and district-level safety committees.

281
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So those have begun.

282
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:19,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.

283
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:28,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.

284
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think he had a meeting today.

285
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:51,568
[SPEAKER_11]: This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.

286
00:26:53,333 --> 00:27:05,300
[SPEAKER_11]: It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.

287
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly for operations would be community schools.

288
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,844
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an ongoing.

289
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,626
[SPEAKER_11]: area of focus and review.

290
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:19,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.

291
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:24,039
[SPEAKER_11]: That's mostly the rental of our buildings.

292
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,203
[SPEAKER_11]: It also sees our summer programming summer fun.

293
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:44,224
[SPEAKER_11]: but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.

294
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:58,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.

295
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:13,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating

296
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:20,415
[SPEAKER_11]: a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.

297
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:31,970
[SPEAKER_11]: We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start

298
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:53,882
[SPEAKER_11]: We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.

299
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:56,524
[SPEAKER_11]: That is an area where it wasn't

300
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:01,539
[SPEAKER_11]: completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.

301
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:07,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.

302
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:12,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And for them, some of this came as a surprise.

303
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:18,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.

304
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:25,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.

305
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:33,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.

306
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:46,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.

307
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:58,656
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.

308
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:02,437
[SPEAKER_11]: That through line is our shared sense of belonging.

309
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:20,960
[SPEAKER_11]: It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are

310
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:27,782
[SPEAKER_11]: mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.

311
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:34,866
[SPEAKER_11]: So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that

312
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:49,442
[SPEAKER_11]: may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.

313
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:58,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so

314
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:14,789
[SPEAKER_11]: critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.

315
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,031
[SPEAKER_11]: And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.

316
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: It was used for instruction.

317
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:27,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.

318
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:46,264
[SPEAKER_11]: more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.

319
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:50,446
[SPEAKER_11]: It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support

320
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:54,593
[SPEAKER_11]: is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.

321
00:31:55,393 --> 00:32:20,077
[SPEAKER_11]: At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what

322
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:21,479
[SPEAKER_11]: individuals need.

323
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,248
[SPEAKER_11]: That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.

324
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:39,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging

325
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:55,453
[SPEAKER_11]: CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.

326
00:32:56,153 --> 00:33:06,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day

327
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:23,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.

328
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:40,021
[SPEAKER_11]: dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.

329
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:53,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.

330
00:33:55,007 --> 00:34:03,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.

331
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:09,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.

332
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:14,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.

333
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:21,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.

334
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,220
[SPEAKER_11]: High quality instructional materials

335
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:40,332
[SPEAKER_11]: make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.

336
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide.

337
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:51,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.

338
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,121
[SPEAKER_11]: This is work that

339
00:34:56,435 --> 00:35:23,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.

340
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:50,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.

341
00:35:52,170 --> 00:36:07,215
[SPEAKER_11]: We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.

342
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:12,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students

343
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,258
[SPEAKER_11]: have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.

344
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:29,871
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.

345
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:30,952
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that transfer.

346
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:41,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.

347
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:59,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.

348
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:09,223
[SPEAKER_11]: The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.

349
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:24,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.

350
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:35,026
[SPEAKER_11]: and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.

351
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:49,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.

352
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:58,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.

353
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:08,438
[SPEAKER_11]: She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.

354
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:15,620
[SPEAKER_11]: She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders

355
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:25,125
[SPEAKER_11]: and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.

356
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:32,319
[SPEAKER_11]: That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.

357
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:40,987
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.

358
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:49,294
[SPEAKER_11]: This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.

359
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.

360
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:06,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.

361
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:11,534
[SPEAKER_11]: This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.

362
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:17,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,

363
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,551
[SPEAKER_11]: is progress monitoring their students.

364
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone has a caseload.

365
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:29,034
[SPEAKER_11]: We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.

366
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:44,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.

367
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:52,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.

368
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:57,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data

369
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:20,261
[SPEAKER_11]: In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.

370
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:27,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.

371
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,032
[SPEAKER_11]: One of this has been some of my favorite.

372
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:35,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year

373
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:43,183
[SPEAKER_11]: twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.

374
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:56,817
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,

375
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:15,981
[SPEAKER_11]: means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.

376
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,302
[SPEAKER_11]: with teachers in buildings.

377
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:26,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.

378
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:27,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

379
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:30,347
[SPEAKER_11]: She's had several meetings with them.

380
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:43,753
[SPEAKER_11]: OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.

381
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:45,194
[SPEAKER_11]: This is

382
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,772
[SPEAKER_11]: a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.

383
00:41:52,473 --> 00:42:12,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.

384
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,817
[SPEAKER_11]: On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.

385
00:42:17,388 --> 00:42:21,191
[SPEAKER_11]: MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.

386
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:46,752
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.

387
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:54,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.

388
00:42:55,627 --> 00:43:05,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.

389
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:31,480
[SPEAKER_11]: We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment

390
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:40,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.

391
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:46,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.

392
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:59,902
[SPEAKER_11]: But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor

393
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,747
[SPEAKER_11]: is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.

394
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the

395
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:21,639
[SPEAKER_11]: caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.

396
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:35,343
[SPEAKER_11]: The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.

397
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:40,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Communication and partnership.

398
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:57,384
[SPEAKER_11]: In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.

399
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:04,488
[SPEAKER_11]: On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.

400
00:45:06,189 --> 00:45:10,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.

401
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:22,817
[SPEAKER_11]: It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.

402
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:26,959
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.

403
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:40,145
[SPEAKER_11]: And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.

404
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:51,333
[SPEAKER_11]: expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.

405
00:45:52,433 --> 00:46:00,159
[SPEAKER_11]: We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.

406
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:16,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.

407
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:28,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that

408
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,593
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.

409
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:45,898
[SPEAKER_11]: This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.

410
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And then responsiveness to situations.

411
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:50,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Administrators.

412
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:54,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.

413
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:56,604
[SPEAKER_11]: School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.

414
00:46:58,013 --> 00:46:59,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And then responsiveness to situations.

415
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:10,272
[SPEAKER_11]: As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.

416
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:17,774
[SPEAKER_11]: When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.

417
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:30,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.

418
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:37,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.

419
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,544
[SPEAKER_11]: The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.

420
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:48,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.

421
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.

422
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,679
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some upcoming forums this month.

423
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,984
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,

424
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:18,482
[SPEAKER_11]: the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.

425
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:31,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.

426
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:40,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.

427
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:46,066
[SPEAKER_11]: We are very mindful though of our search committees.

428
00:48:46,626 --> 00:49:07,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.

429
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is something that we have committed to

430
00:49:11,088 --> 00:49:15,887
[SPEAKER_11]: before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.

431
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:19,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's the task force committee.

432
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:38,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.

433
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:44,627
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.

434
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:50,310
[SPEAKER_11]: who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.

435
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.

436
00:49:54,652 --> 00:50:03,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.

437
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:12,522
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.

438
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:14,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's important that we hear from

439
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:16,245
[SPEAKER_11]: from all voices.

440
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.

441
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:44,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.

442
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:58,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.

443
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:04,174
[SPEAKER_11]: MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.

444
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:08,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just like one example of a district-based one is

445
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:18,010
[SPEAKER_11]: The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.

446
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:38,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.

447
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:47,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.

448
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:57,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.

449
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:14,270
[SPEAKER_11]: But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.

450
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:20,115
[SPEAKER_11]: But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.

451
00:52:20,195 --> 00:52:24,538
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is ongoing work for myself.

452
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,300
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have really

453
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:30,591
[SPEAKER_11]: committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.

454
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:39,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.

455
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:54,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,

456
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:05,373
[SPEAKER_11]: but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.

457
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:11,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.

458
00:53:13,015 --> 00:53:19,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.

459
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:24,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that I am

460
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:33,654
[SPEAKER_11]: working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.

461
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:48,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.

462
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

463
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:59,402
[SPEAKER_11]: So with all this said, planning for the future.

464
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:17,238
[SPEAKER_11]: So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.

465
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:24,892
[SPEAKER_11]: With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.

466
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,553
[SPEAKER_11]: They are goals that we want to maintain.

467
00:54:27,673 --> 00:54:35,997
[SPEAKER_11]: It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.

468
00:54:36,597 --> 00:54:41,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.

469
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:47,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So first, our continuing priorities.

470
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.

471
00:54:58,322 --> 00:55:02,947
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.

472
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:30,086
[SPEAKER_11]: that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.

473
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,767
[SPEAKER_11]: So strengthening those supports for students

474
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:41,134
[SPEAKER_11]: so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.

475
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:52,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.

476
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:57,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.

477
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:06,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.

478
00:56:07,856 --> 00:56:16,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.

479
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:25,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.

480
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,927
[SPEAKER_11]: also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.

481
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.

482
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:44,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's an important thing to note.

483
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:50,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.

484
00:56:50,849 --> 00:57:01,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.

485
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:07,675
[SPEAKER_11]: So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.

486
00:57:08,236 --> 00:57:11,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.

487
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:11,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

488
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:20,207
[SPEAKER_11]: each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.

489
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:35,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.

490
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I did highlight this in my

491
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,161
[SPEAKER_11]: report of interim findings.

492
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:50,364
[SPEAKER_11]: That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.

493
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:57,966
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.

494
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:01,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Enhancing communication and community trust.

495
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:06,109
[SPEAKER_11]: So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures

496
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:19,750
[SPEAKER_11]: making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.

497
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:21,932
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that is continuous work.

498
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:29,298
[SPEAKER_11]: and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.

499
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:37,766
[SPEAKER_11]: We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I

500
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:54,818
[SPEAKER_11]: it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.

501
00:58:55,578 --> 00:59:06,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing

502
00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:14,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.

503
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:26,571
[SPEAKER_11]: How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.

504
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:29,834
[SPEAKER_11]: That's work that will be continuing.

505
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:33,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.

506
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:35,807
[SPEAKER_11]: and how they're working with them.

507
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:44,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.

508
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:54,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.

509
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:56,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And our CBA before,

510
00:59:57,645 --> 01:00:01,708
[SPEAKER_11]: did not have any layers of educator leadership.

511
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:02,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it does.

512
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:09,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.

513
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:21,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.

514
01:00:23,106 --> 01:00:25,868
[SPEAKER_11]: That is work that is ongoing for us.

515
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:32,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Now moving to work that our new goals.

516
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:38,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.

517
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:45,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.

518
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:52,535
[SPEAKER_11]: This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.

519
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:58,861
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.

520
01:00:59,962 --> 01:01:02,543
[SPEAKER_11]: One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.

521
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:13,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.

522
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:28,295
[SPEAKER_11]: This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction

523
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:33,694
[SPEAKER_11]: available effectively and meaningfully for students.

524
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:38,446
[SPEAKER_11]: That is work that is critical.

525
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:41,207
[SPEAKER_11]: the implementation of open architects.

526
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:53,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.

527
01:01:55,595 --> 01:02:03,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.

528
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.

529
01:02:11,177 --> 01:02:23,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.

530
01:02:25,987 --> 01:02:37,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff

531
01:02:39,277 --> 01:02:44,381
[SPEAKER_11]: at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.

532
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:54,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.

533
01:02:55,630 --> 01:03:03,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.

534
01:03:06,355 --> 01:03:09,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.

535
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,702
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a true goal here.

536
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:21,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.

537
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:25,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.

538
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:34,622
[SPEAKER_11]: I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.

539
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:40,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.

540
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:42,436
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is wonderful.

541
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:47,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.

542
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:49,220
[SPEAKER_11]: There might be one at the elementary.

543
01:03:49,360 --> 01:04:01,828
[SPEAKER_11]: But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.

544
01:04:01,948 --> 01:04:07,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.

545
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:19,034
[SPEAKER_11]: The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.

546
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:26,523
[SPEAKER_11]: She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think

547
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:33,948
[SPEAKER_11]: her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.

548
01:04:34,028 --> 01:04:38,930
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.

549
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:45,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been

550
01:04:46,774 --> 01:04:58,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.

551
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.

552
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:05,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we have a process, we find a way to

553
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:08,355
[SPEAKER_11]: fine tune and make it better.

554
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:12,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.

555
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:30,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision

556
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:37,085
[SPEAKER_11]: and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.

557
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:51,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.

558
01:05:52,934 --> 01:06:00,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.

559
01:06:00,818 --> 01:06:03,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's through the MSBA forum.

560
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.

561
01:06:10,543 --> 01:06:18,687
[SPEAKER_11]: We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're

562
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:29,716
[SPEAKER_11]: getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.

563
01:06:31,097 --> 01:06:35,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.

564
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:43,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.

565
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:59,038
[SPEAKER_11]: It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.

566
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:10,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.

567
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:13,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

568
01:07:13,578 --> 01:07:14,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

569
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:15,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi.

570
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:17,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Very thorough, great presentation.

571
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from the body?

572
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:21,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo?

573
01:07:25,305 --> 01:07:26,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

574
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:27,986
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a lot.

575
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:35,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But first off, I want to say I'm thrilled, and this is very loud today.

576
01:07:36,645 --> 01:07:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thrilled that it's clear you can walk and chew gum at the same time.

577
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:49,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find a good analogy that was less American sounding, so everybody would understand it.

578
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:54,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's nice to see the number of different things that you are covering.

579
01:07:55,163 --> 01:07:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you covered everything it sounded like, frankly.

580
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:00,489
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of times I was like, oh yeah, we do that too, don't we?

581
01:08:03,276 --> 01:08:06,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So communications is, as you know, is something that is.

582
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:14,827
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatically better than it was when I started eight years ago and I'm thrilled with the progress we've made.

583
01:08:15,648 --> 01:08:17,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things that you're right is never done.

584
01:08:17,849 --> 01:08:28,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's because the audience changes or if maybe it just takes a long time to fully build out a system to kind of get it right all the time.

585
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:36,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But my daughter was tardy to school today and I want to read the two sentences out of that email we got.

586
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:44,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, we would like to help you and your student in any way we can to alleviate this attendance concern.

587
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:53,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime a student has tardies, it is a concern to us, since tardies cause a student to miss significant instruction and learning opportunities at school.

588
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:56,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, I don't know when this changed.

589
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might have been this year.

590
01:08:59,522 --> 01:09:16,004
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's a very good example of how there's nothing in this entire, there's more to the email, but there's nothing in there about compliance and DESE and getting the, not Attorney General, but who?

591
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:17,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner?

592
01:09:18,046 --> 01:09:32,591
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know if you have too many absences we used to get automatic letters from like the district attorney with legalese Yes, and and so it's it's instead of like a bunch of threats It's like how can we help your student to get their education?

593
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:33,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're here.

594
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we want.

595
01:09:34,811 --> 01:09:38,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So It seems like a minor thing, but that email is so

596
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:47,919
[SPEAKER_04]: descriptive of what I've seen as change in the district since you've become the interim superintendent, so that's wonderful.

597
01:09:49,901 --> 01:09:50,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just highlight that?

598
01:09:50,902 --> 01:09:51,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

599
01:09:51,462 --> 01:09:56,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That is also just an example of that through line of our charge of belonging.

600
01:09:57,167 --> 01:10:07,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for a family to receive, sometimes you have to have the conversation about the legal part that is attached to attendance, but receiving it without

601
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,683
[SPEAKER_11]: having a conversation is the piece about how we're communicating.

602
01:10:13,464 --> 01:10:15,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we are sharing that sense of belonging.

603
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:17,306
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for that feedback.

604
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:26,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I just found it to be very descriptive of this, of how I feel about the district since you've taken the helm.

605
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, for eight years I have been asking the question, what are the community schools?

606
01:10:32,998 --> 01:10:37,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have never gotten, in my opinion, a satisfactory answer.

607
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I'm starting to get a grasp that it's just a rental company essentially.

608
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:48,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Which would also provide summer fun.

609
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:54,594
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would have really been so much easier to just for me to have heard those words.

610
01:10:54,694 --> 01:10:59,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that I have a grasp of what it is I'm very glad to hear that it's getting a lot of focus because

611
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:18,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's some people in the community who are not happy with these changes and I think that we have, we can do better but we also have to kind of get a grasp of what are they and what do we want them to be and how do we want to support the community.

612
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:22,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very excited that that work is being undertaken.

613
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:28,855
[SPEAKER_04]: For communications that are around each, around incidents, so the non-standard daily things,

614
01:11:30,464 --> 01:11:48,345
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have an after action review for each of those to figure out like, okay, the communication was not well received or was well received and how can we make sure that the next time there's an incident of an intruder in a building that the communication hits all the notes the right way?

615
01:11:48,365 --> 01:11:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the barrage of

616
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: complaints afterwards is, you know, that I don't think there's anything wrong with the barrage of upset people.

617
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:03,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure like the next time it happens that we kind of do better.

618
01:12:03,589 --> 01:12:06,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't necessarily do it right because you kind of, it's like a sort of a practice thing.

619
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:11,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you have an after action review for each of these incident related communications?

620
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:17,297
[SPEAKER_11]: We do for most, not all, but I think the ones that

621
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:19,153
[SPEAKER_11]: warrant that level.

622
01:12:19,213 --> 01:12:20,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did for that situation.

623
01:12:21,774 --> 01:12:23,675
[SPEAKER_11]: We had more than one at different levels.

624
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:24,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

625
01:12:25,336 --> 01:12:25,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

626
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:33,460
[SPEAKER_11]: That is important for us to inform our practice and inform our decision making moving forward.

627
01:12:34,108 --> 01:12:34,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

628
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Will we be having another presentation, and maybe we already have one in the fall, forgive me if I forget, on reading and how we're doing on that?

629
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:46,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

630
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:53,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like, are we at like year four or three of really revamping that whole thing?

631
01:12:53,124 --> 01:12:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that in the first couple of years it was like

632
01:12:57,783 --> 01:13:03,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding how we were doing, well the data wasn't there and it was, you know, there's a tail to that.

633
01:13:04,428 --> 01:13:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: To that data that makes it hard to understand, but I would like us to see that we're really hitting that one out of the park.

634
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:18,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuz we were ahead of the state for the most part on that and making sure all the kids can read grade level.

635
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:24,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to tell you is a critical requirement for everything else we do here.

636
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:24,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

637
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

638
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:25,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

639
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:31,237
[SPEAKER_11]: greater data presentation next month.

640
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:32,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

641
01:13:32,657 --> 01:13:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will let my colleagues ask questions.

642
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:36,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Russo.

643
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:37,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

644
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:40,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:47,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say how much I appreciated that all of your comments about

646
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:58,953
[SPEAKER_07]: your accomplishments so far and your plans were aligned with what this group and what I think the community is expecting.

647
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:12,560
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think for too long we had like a superintendent's agenda and a school committee agenda and a community agenda and everyone had a different agenda and we were all sort of like generally operating in a direction but not really.

648
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's important that when you talk about alignment

649
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:24,369
[SPEAKER_07]: you you can't have your own agenda as the superintendent if it doesn't match.

650
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:24,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

651
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:30,151
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not connected to like sort of what the community expects and what we expect.

652
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:41,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just really appreciated that even as you were laying out goals you you sort of drew a line of distinction between these are goals we're going to continue to work on because we're not quite there yet.

653
01:14:41,635 --> 01:14:43,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are the things that

654
01:14:44,437 --> 01:14:55,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We think are important priorities that are important to you but also that they will be like weight weighed into the strategic planning conversation that is coming and is you know badly needed.

655
01:14:55,885 --> 01:14:59,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes I appreciate the connection there.

656
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:04,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the other comment is that we have made.

657
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:13,182
[SPEAKER_07]: a tremendous amount of change in the last year in this district starting with the changes to the schedule.

658
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:17,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think it has gone like perfectly.

659
01:15:18,204 --> 01:15:24,805
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also think all things considered it's gone pretty smoothly actually.

660
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:26,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think

661
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Having Dr. Galluzzi at the table from a negotiating perspective was really important because we really talked a lot about the instructional aspects and impact of what we were asking for that may have sounded administrative in nature at the time, but it wasn't.

662
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:51,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, this enables us to do something different instructionally.

663
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:56,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like that's really important, and there's sort of

664
01:15:57,171 --> 01:16:14,335
[SPEAKER_07]: countless ways that the superintendent gets involved behind the scenes and things that the public does not see so directly but gets but but the tail is there eventually and I feel like there's a whole slew of things in that category for me that we are in the middle of.

665
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:20,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we've seen like the best of like middle school programming and challenge classes because it's year one.

666
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:21,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

667
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:26,718
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be asked to present at DESE and to have the

668
01:16:28,163 --> 01:16:41,891
[SPEAKER_07]: secretary of education and the lieutenant governor come here and I happen to be able to attend that presentation and talk to them about how we've implemented it here versus how they see it implemented in other communities.

669
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:51,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like a really thoughtful it was a really thoughtful way to sort of ease into some of the challenge programming and

670
01:16:53,563 --> 01:17:05,750
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like sort of interesting to see the level of attention that all of that is getting in our first year like in our first outing so hats off to the team that is making.

671
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:15,852
[SPEAKER_07]: those things happen because you usually don't get credit for implementation until a little bit further down the line.

672
01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to comment that this has all come at the hands of a tremendous amount of work, particularly as lots of seats were vacated early in your tenure.

673
01:17:29,755 --> 01:17:39,400
[SPEAKER_07]: There were times that you were the only one in certain places and having to deal with what came and stabilize the district.

674
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that stabilization feels very far away.

675
01:17:44,422 --> 01:17:45,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we did it.

676
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:48,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the purpose of the appointment and all of that good stuff.

677
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:55,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But behind the scenes, what that took to actually stabilize the district was

678
01:17:56,049 --> 01:17:57,750
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of bigger than you can put on a slide.

679
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:02,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems so far away that I don't think you did it justice in your comments.

680
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:06,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm happy that it's in the rear view.

681
01:18:06,775 --> 01:18:07,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

682
01:18:07,935 --> 01:18:08,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

683
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:16,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that because the first day of my interim appointment was the day of the executive orders.

684
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:22,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was a lot of work right at the beginning and a lot of communication.

685
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:24,752
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been quite the year.

686
01:18:25,974 --> 01:18:28,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank my family for their understanding and support.

687
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:31,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really.

688
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:36,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeld and then our student rep.

689
01:18:38,065 --> 01:18:38,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for this.

690
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:41,968
[SPEAKER_06]: This was, as Member Russo said, very, very full of things.

691
01:18:42,068 --> 01:18:51,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you were going through it, I was just thinking back to that meeting where we very quickly had to appoint an interim and we kind of went around the table and said, what are we looking for?

692
01:18:51,956 --> 01:18:56,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people said consistency as we transition into new leadership.

693
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:59,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people said an ability to shake things up.

694
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:16,375
[SPEAKER_06]: with new leadership, and I think this really reflects both of those pieces, and I appreciate the balance that we're seeing here, but not just the balance of, all right, these are the right proportions, we've got it figured out, and we're just going to keep going.

695
01:19:17,495 --> 01:19:27,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It reflects a lot of continuous reassessment, which is what we need, not just in the situ, situational moments, but really, where are we now as a district?

696
01:19:28,044 --> 01:19:29,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I very much appreciate that.

697
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:34,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little bit of a question, follow up question from member Russo about the.

698
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:38,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think it's important for us to think about that.

699
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:41,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important for us to think about that.

700
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important for us to think about that.

701
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That reassurance that it happened and that these are the protocols and the clarity around that.

702
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:13,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's a piece that is very hard to communicate here but is useful to know about as far as leadership's approach there.

703
01:20:13,631 --> 01:20:22,057
[SPEAKER_11]: 100% and I think a lot of that presentation can come out of the work that the district safety committee is doing.

704
01:20:22,497 --> 01:20:26,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of the pieces that we heard from staff members

705
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:38,798
[SPEAKER_11]: specifically was around the level or lack thereof of professional development that was tied to the I Love You Guys protocol.

706
01:20:38,878 --> 01:20:45,903
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is actually one of the priorities on Mr. Lord's agenda.

707
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:47,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think they

708
01:20:49,004 --> 01:21:00,991
[SPEAKER_11]: tackled a little bit of that in today's meeting so that they are going, at a school level, going to be talking about the training and the resetting of expectations around that protocol.

709
01:21:01,051 --> 01:21:16,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yes, there are certain pieces we, for safety reasons, don't want to share with the community, but I think, like, a progress of what those district-level meetings are focusing on and working on is something 100 percent that can be shared.

710
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:18,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

711
01:21:19,645 --> 01:21:24,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one piece I think was missing, I don't think you mentioned it, but the hiring of a transportation manager.

712
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:34,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate how you've been looking at the staffing and people who are doing multiple jobs and how that can be best distributed.

713
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:39,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about it at central leadership, but I think it's also happening at other levels as well.

714
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

715
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I've noticed it and I wanted to comment on it.

716
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:45,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

717
01:21:45,135 --> 01:22:06,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I will just conclude because I know other people have things to say that seeing these action items and this progress laid out the way it was, I think it really helps to figure out what reports we need as a committee for this next term, what we want to see, what resolutions we need to

718
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:22,922
[SPEAKER_06]: to work together, so I think your comments about the partnership in the beginning are really appreciated, and I would reflect them back to you, because this was very helpful in understanding what's been going on in front of and behind the scenes, so thank you for this, spending the time.

719
01:22:22,962 --> 01:22:30,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this probably took a lot of time to put together on top of all these other things that are actually in here, so thank you very much.

720
01:22:30,968 --> 01:22:31,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

721
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:36,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt-Alachi, and then I think we have Member Olopade and Member Prox.

722
01:22:42,113 --> 01:22:47,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

723
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:52,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my fellow committee members already mentioned it, but it was very impressive.

724
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:59,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you stayed on task, you stayed on all of these myriad of different topics for so long.

725
01:23:00,302 --> 01:23:01,883
[SPEAKER_08]: want to give you a bit of applause there.

726
01:23:01,903 --> 01:23:07,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few questions, but I want to be really quick because I know other members still want to go.

727
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:12,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that some of my other members were talking about the Humanities and Health Curriculum Review.

728
01:23:13,212 --> 01:23:17,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is sort of in charge of the review process for that?

729
01:23:17,816 --> 01:23:26,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, so Dr. Kim Talbot is the assistant superintendent for athletics, excuse me, for academics and instruction.

730
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:28,323
[SPEAKER_11]: New title there, right?

731
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:41,772
[SPEAKER_11]: She would help lead that work, but the director of physical education and health is Rachel Perry, and so the two of them would be leading that work.

732
01:23:43,072 --> 01:23:44,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

733
01:23:49,932 --> 01:23:51,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know exactly what slide it was.

734
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was the enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.

735
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You said that this sort of data that you'd be collecting through this new analytics sort of platform and stuff would be sort of used in real time to advise for instruction and whatnot.

736
01:24:12,072 --> 01:24:16,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, could you give an example of how you want this or how it is being implemented?

737
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:23,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, are you talking, I'm so sorry, Lachi, because with the heating system, I want to make sure I hear you correctly.

738
01:24:23,656 --> 01:24:24,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you talking about the open architects?

739
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:32,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just remember you saying, or in my notes, you were saying that some of this data would be used in real time.

740
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:36,124
[SPEAKER_08]: That just stuck out to me, so I was just wondering if you could provide an example.

741
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:37,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, absolutely.

742
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:42,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So real time might not necessarily be

743
01:24:43,337 --> 01:24:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: in the middle of a lesson.

744
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:45,878
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be.

745
01:24:46,018 --> 01:24:51,459
[SPEAKER_11]: But the real-time part is we don't have to wait for an end-of-unit assessment.

746
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:57,280
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to wait for mid-year, beginning of the year, end-of-year large benchmarks.

747
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:11,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Real-time means teachers will have, through the use of these dashboards, the Hill for Literacy one, also this Open Architects platform, they will have at their fingertips data that

748
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:22,757
[SPEAKER_11]: they're using consistently that can inform their planning and their instruction from day to day or from week to week.

749
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:31,080
[SPEAKER_11]: So when they're sitting out planning for the week, when they're sitting out planning for the day, they have accessible to them different modes of data.

750
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:35,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of that is also data that teachers collect just by

751
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:49,863
[SPEAKER_11]: student responses, just by exit tickets, like there's a myriad of ways that teachers are using data that they can bring into real time that's going to impact their planning and their teaching.

752
01:25:51,117 --> 01:26:07,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you envision it more on like a class level where these teachers are seeing this data and they're, you know, could advise sort of what they need to spend more curriculum time on, or is it on a specific student level where they might see that a student is struggling, they want to reach out, or maybe both?

753
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what is... All of the above.

754
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:10,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

755
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:19,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's at the student level, it's at the class level, it's at the department level, it's at the grade level, it's at the school level.

756
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:39,551
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all of the above because teachers doing it on their own to make sure they're meeting students' needs, but also working together with their peers to work on grade level data or department data, school leaders, department leaders working with teachers on a greater scale.

757
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,352
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really for all the levels.

758
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:48,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, that sounds amazing from a teacher, educator perspective.

759
01:26:49,817 --> 01:26:54,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Sir, for DIBELS, I'm so sorry, there's so many on this slide.

760
01:26:55,382 --> 01:27:01,868
[SPEAKER_08]: You just said that they, it is historically sort of like helped ground educators in the district.

761
01:27:03,249 --> 01:27:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that sort of a similar thing where you're talking about

762
01:27:08,748 --> 01:27:13,354
[SPEAKER_08]: using the data from the system to advise their curriculum.

763
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:14,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, DIBLS, thank you.

764
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:15,377
[SPEAKER_11]: DIBLS, yes.

765
01:27:15,557 --> 01:27:15,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

766
01:27:16,518 --> 01:27:23,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so DIBLS is used to assess students' reading level and reading ability.

767
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:25,250
[SPEAKER_11]: So it looks different.

768
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:34,688
[SPEAKER_11]: K to two as it does three to five it also looks different per each student and what their own independent reading level is.

769
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:40,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Dibbles is given as both a benchmark and progress monitoring.

770
01:27:40,254 --> 01:27:45,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a benchmark it's given to every student beginning of the year middle of the year and end of the year.

771
01:27:45,944 --> 01:27:50,007
[SPEAKER_11]: That's tracked in a way, and that's data that's used to inform.

772
01:27:50,607 --> 01:27:53,649
[SPEAKER_11]: But then some students require progress monitoring.

773
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:59,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all do, but students that are below grade level, they require progress monitoring.

774
01:28:00,313 --> 01:28:02,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Some students, they may have to be monitored

775
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,491
[SPEAKER_11]: every two weeks, every four weeks.

776
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:11,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Other students might be only every six or eight weeks, so it depends on the level of need.

777
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:16,856
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this Dibbles is a quick screener, it's like one minute.

778
01:28:18,677 --> 01:28:29,222
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also used for progress monitoring, so teachers can track at those intervals what the progress has been, what the growth has been, so that they can really target

779
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,170
[SPEAKER_11]: their instruction.

780
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:40,754
[SPEAKER_11]: What's awesome about the Hill for Literacy platform that we use called Continuum is that all of this data is put in that platform.

781
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only do teachers have access to what the data is, but it will help them provide what the instructional focus should be for that specific student.

782
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So then teachers have that at the student level.

783
01:28:56,402 --> 01:29:05,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they can use that data to group students by the needs that they have, and really target their instruction during small group time.

784
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

785
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:09,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

786
01:29:09,257 --> 01:29:12,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, just one more.

787
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:27,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't know this off the top of your head, that's totally fine, but what has been the cost profile monetarily of open architects compared to previous systems, or if this is a new sort of... That's a very good question.

788
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:37,515
[SPEAKER_11]: First, I want to start, though, only because you asked about Dibbles, and I think Dibbles is key because Dibbles is only like a dollar a student.

789
01:29:37,535 --> 01:29:41,798
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really just paying for the platform, so it's very, very, very cost efficient.

790
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:44,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Open Architects, seven?

791
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:44,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, 20.

792
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,014
[SPEAKER_11]: $20,000 for district wide access.

793
01:29:52,054 --> 01:30:01,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be all staff though, all educators, teachers and administrators will have access to that platform.

794
01:30:02,482 --> 01:30:02,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

795
01:30:03,543 --> 01:30:03,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

796
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:06,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, that was very impressive.

797
01:30:06,845 --> 01:30:07,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

798
01:30:07,205 --> 01:30:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Elachi.

799
01:30:08,046 --> 01:30:08,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

800
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:11,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Lopare, then Member Parks.

801
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

802
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:17,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say how much I appreciate, I think,

803
01:30:18,868 --> 01:30:20,932
[SPEAKER_01]: full in-depth explanation you kind of gave us.

804
01:30:20,972 --> 01:30:23,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you covered quite a bit in a really short amount of time.

805
01:30:23,803 --> 01:30:30,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I really appreciated from the beginning of your term or your tenure is the collective charge of belonging.

806
01:30:31,347 --> 01:30:35,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that that's underscoring, I think, a lot of what you detailed here.

807
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_01]: The conversation about communication and partnership, the inclusion of caregiver engagement, I think, is incredibly important.

808
01:30:41,313 --> 01:30:49,037
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the parents that I've communicated with in the public in the last handful of months have communicated both the excitement that they've been seeing from their students coming home from class

809
01:30:49,517 --> 01:30:58,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Acknowledging that it's becoming more and more challenging to be a fully, you know, involved parent because of the cost of living, for example, you know, scheduling difficulties.

810
01:30:59,305 --> 01:31:03,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the time we're sending our students to school each and every day and not being as engaged as we want to be.

811
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:15,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having this, I think, increased communication with always room for improvement, as you mentioned, I think has been a huge benefit to the public and the general student population to understand more about what's going on.

812
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:28,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I just want to be able to acknowledge that this belonging as we continue into the next, the remaining two quarters or trimesters for one of our schools, and then the next academic year as well, is that to maintain that belonging.

813
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:31,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I think emphasis that you've been really highlighting, so I just want to appreciate it.

814
01:31:31,907 --> 01:31:32,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

815
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:32,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

816
01:31:33,409 --> 01:31:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Olopade.

817
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Parks.

818
01:31:37,068 --> 01:31:37,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

819
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:43,595
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot has been done and I will be looking closely at everything some more.

820
01:31:44,075 --> 01:31:45,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm learning a lot more about it.

821
01:31:45,957 --> 01:31:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my questions though is how do you collect feedback.

822
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:52,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot has been mentioned about.

823
01:31:53,724 --> 01:32:12,169
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, things like going well and some things don't go as well, maybe the schedule or even how do you collect feedback on open architects or some of the other PD programs and know that they're working or people are embracing them or whether it be students or teachers or anyone really.

824
01:32:12,189 --> 01:32:14,130
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great question.

825
01:32:16,071 --> 01:32:17,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not near the microphone.

826
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:18,331
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great question.

827
01:32:18,351 --> 01:32:20,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say there's

828
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:26,189
[SPEAKER_11]: When we have meetings when we have professional development there's always an exit ticket.

829
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:37,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And we really are using that data to structure and refine the next session and we're being very intentional.

830
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:44,815
[SPEAKER_11]: about how we are honoring that feedback in the shifts that we're making to the format of how we're doing things.

831
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:48,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have given a lot of surveys.

832
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:58,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this speaks to part of my and our ongoing look at how we are collecting data.

833
01:32:59,168 --> 01:33:07,233
[SPEAKER_11]: the, you know, we're getting responses from surveys, but it's not always capturing the full essence of Medford.

834
01:33:07,753 --> 01:33:11,816
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that is ongoing work for us.

835
01:33:12,756 --> 01:33:16,358
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always also, too, a level of street data.

836
01:33:16,919 --> 01:33:18,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you bump into people at

837
01:33:19,983 --> 01:33:30,446
[SPEAKER_11]: When I bump into people at the outings, when we're doing walkthroughs in schools, when we're showing up at meetings, there's also that level of feedback that's given.

838
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:43,829
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that we've really been doing as a leadership team, a central leadership team, is trying to create landing pages and spreadsheets

839
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:53,836
[SPEAKER_11]: so that it provides us opportunities to kind of input that data.

840
01:33:55,556 --> 01:34:06,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially Dr. Talbot and I, we have a running one so that when we're hearing these things or when something pops up, we have a place that we are recording that so that we can go back.

841
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:18,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Very similar to what the administration to or like creating like landing spaces for people so that they know where they can go to kind of get some of that information.

842
01:34:19,703 --> 01:34:25,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would say part of that is also our continuous work that we're doing.

843
01:34:25,585 --> 01:34:36,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the upcoming forums is another place to be gathering real feedback and input from people in person.

844
01:34:36,349 --> 01:34:43,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a survey will go out as well, but I gathered a lot of very important data during the meet and greets.

845
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:50,248
[SPEAKER_11]: and when we participate in the committees and the task force.

846
01:34:50,929 --> 01:34:56,311
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, it's really just that piece of how we're making sure it's all voices.

847
01:34:56,531 --> 01:35:01,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the work that is still needed.

848
01:35:03,254 --> 01:35:03,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

849
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question?

850
01:35:04,655 --> 01:35:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

851
01:35:05,155 --> 01:35:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

852
01:35:05,315 --> 01:35:05,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

853
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:10,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Mastroboni and then Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.

854
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:12,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

855
01:35:12,398 --> 01:35:13,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, Superintendent.

856
01:35:14,526 --> 01:35:21,255
[SPEAKER_00]: great first meeting for myself and I'm really happy to get caught up on all the work that you and especially the leadership team have been doing.

857
01:35:21,915 --> 01:35:28,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Three things that jumped out to me, it's clear you're doing a lot of organizational change and organizational improvement.

858
01:35:28,464 --> 01:35:32,709
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard work that takes a long time and it's really great to see

859
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:38,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reflected so much in the work that you want to share with us.

860
01:35:40,012 --> 01:35:51,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, the idea of curriculum development support, helping our educators not have to take the time to develop the curriculum, but really focus on how they present it and try and make that connection.

861
01:35:51,815 --> 01:35:53,035
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real force multiplier.

862
01:35:53,155 --> 01:35:57,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, something that I really want to give you credit for and give your team credit for.

863
01:35:59,472 --> 01:36:00,393
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic stuff.

864
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:05,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, something near and dear to my heart is community schools.

865
01:36:05,876 --> 01:36:07,317
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a community resource.

866
01:36:08,058 --> 01:36:16,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the managers and stewards of those places, I think we have to strike a balance between the generational equity of

867
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:25,108
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing supporting the users right now and being able to maintain those assets for users in the future 10, 20, 30 years from now.

868
01:36:25,188 --> 01:36:31,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really looking forward to what your team is going to bring to us to talk about what the future of community schools looks like.

869
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,151
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you so much for the presentation.

870
01:36:33,391 --> 01:36:33,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

871
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:35,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy to partner with you in that work too.

872
01:36:36,933 --> 01:36:38,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like you might have some good ideas.

873
01:36:40,154 --> 01:36:40,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

874
01:36:42,807 --> 01:36:43,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

875
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:54,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I just before we move off of this topic wanted to make sure that for the community we're clear about what the next steps are in terms of the superintendent's evaluation.

876
01:36:54,312 --> 01:36:58,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll let member Olopade tell us that.

877
01:36:58,494 --> 01:36:59,675
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think my question.

878
01:37:00,424 --> 01:37:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: for like also for like planning purposes around MSBA stuff is are we still like on track to have an evaluation to review together on the meeting on the 26th?

879
01:37:11,516 --> 01:37:13,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you need help from this committee?

880
01:37:19,358 --> 01:37:20,078
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.

881
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:27,961
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to come out to the members that we spoke about.

882
01:37:28,261 --> 01:37:29,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a forum member in Tapa.

883
01:37:29,742 --> 01:37:30,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a forum member at Brandley.

884
01:37:32,654 --> 01:37:33,995
[SPEAKER_01]: not newest members of the committee.

885
01:37:34,115 --> 01:37:45,460
[SPEAKER_01]: That will come out tomorrow morning for each of us to, now that we've had the evaluation from the superintendent, we'll be able to each compile our thoughts and our wants for the community to be known.

886
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will take that data, compile that into a succinct messaging.

887
01:37:49,722 --> 01:37:58,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that to be clear to the public that what I will be reading out is a coalescing of all the thoughts and reviewing opinions from the,

888
01:38:01,437 --> 01:38:14,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Established members from the previous meeting so it will not be verbatim from each member unless a member feels like there needs to be something said but in general that's not this that's not the standard or that's not the Model that we follow but that will be ready for the 26th.

889
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:15,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is the meeting

890
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:23,472
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may from the chair, just to piggyback, we'll get it tomorrow morning and then how long, when should we have it back to you for compilation?

891
01:38:23,552 --> 01:38:30,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Preferably, that'll, I'll have that before Sunday, Sunday the 18th?

892
01:38:31,176 --> 01:38:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

893
01:38:31,776 --> 01:38:31,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

894
01:38:32,096 --> 01:38:36,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that gives me about, that gives me about a week's worth of time to compile all the information.

895
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:44,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to push it any further because we want to have that finalized, that review finalized in public before MSBA in the next step, so.

896
01:38:45,382 --> 01:38:45,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.

897
01:38:45,822 --> 01:38:46,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

898
01:38:47,704 --> 01:38:48,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the presentation.

899
01:38:49,165 --> 01:38:50,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with my colleagues.

900
01:38:51,347 --> 01:38:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to say a few words?

901
01:38:54,369 --> 01:38:55,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

902
01:38:57,108 --> 01:39:00,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Simon Alcindor, 44 Tainter Street.

903
01:39:00,889 --> 01:39:06,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering, because you did mention how you're strengthening existing modes of communication, especially to parents.

904
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:21,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering what work has been done with diversifying communication, especially, because I was curious, so I did take a look online, and there isn't really much outside of the school's website in terms of just like forward-facing communication.

905
01:39:21,114 --> 01:39:24,375
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great question.

906
01:39:25,562 --> 01:39:32,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot of this is in partnership with my communications director, Will Pippicelli.

907
01:39:33,488 --> 01:39:36,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do maintain the website.

908
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:38,372
[SPEAKER_11]: We have updated our website.

909
01:39:38,432 --> 01:39:50,021
[SPEAKER_11]: We are continuing to update our website to make sure that it is providing families in the community with updated information as best as possible.

910
01:39:50,521 --> 01:39:54,124
[SPEAKER_11]: When we send something out, we are sending out our communications

911
01:39:54,895 --> 01:39:58,081
[SPEAKER_11]: through the platform that the website is on called FinalSight.

912
01:39:58,642 --> 01:40:02,870
[SPEAKER_11]: That automatically translates communications for families.

913
01:40:03,808 --> 01:40:19,279
[SPEAKER_11]: We also use an app called Talking Points that is like a texting app, so caregivers can get it directly on their phones or their devices that also automatically translates any documentation that they need.

914
01:40:20,019 --> 01:40:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We do also have a Facebook, Medford Public Schools Facebook page, and that's, Ms.

915
01:40:25,763 --> 01:40:27,984
[SPEAKER_11]: DiPipaselli updates that regularly.

916
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:29,425
[SPEAKER_11]: And then,

917
01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:41,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I send out a weekly communication, and the school leaders, the principals also send out either weekly, bi-weekly, monthly newsletters to their communities.

918
01:40:42,755 --> 01:40:42,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

919
01:40:42,975 --> 01:40:43,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

920
01:40:43,436 --> 01:40:43,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

921
01:40:45,237 --> 01:40:45,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.

922
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:46,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

923
01:40:46,057 --> 01:40:48,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and your newsletter translates as well.

924
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Automatically through the site.

925
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:50,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

926
01:40:50,721 --> 01:40:50,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

927
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

928
01:40:52,202 --> 01:40:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo, and then we're going to move on to the school calendar.

929
01:40:55,204 --> 01:40:55,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

930
01:40:55,965 --> 01:40:58,987
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a question, though, that is, you know,

931
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:06,385
[SPEAKER_04]: With the end of newspapers, there's no one place that everybody goes to anymore.

932
01:41:06,745 --> 01:41:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like if you go to Facebook, Medford Politics has 2,000 people, most of whom probably live in Medford.

933
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:21,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could believe that you're communicating with Medford when you're in there, and you are communicating with some of Medford.

934
01:41:22,105 --> 01:41:33,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a challenge that is, I think there are whole sections of the city for which there is no communication path other than knocking on their door or mailing them something.

935
01:41:35,275 --> 01:41:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: both of which are wildly expensive, obviously.

936
01:41:38,737 --> 01:41:44,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think it's a sad situation we're in, especially when we talk about a new high school.

937
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:54,866
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about a new high school, it's going to be, you know, we're not going to be able to publish op-eds in newspapers and think we're hitting most of the voters.

938
01:41:54,986 --> 01:41:58,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a real challenge of our time.

939
01:41:58,348 --> 01:42:01,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't envy our communications group.

940
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:03,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that question.

941
01:42:03,531 --> 01:42:04,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really important.

942
01:42:06,908 --> 01:42:07,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Russo.

943
01:42:08,649 --> 01:42:10,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you again, Dr. Galluzzi.

944
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:15,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, we have our recommendation to approve the school year 26-27 district calendar.

945
01:42:16,352 --> 01:42:18,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Galluzzi.

946
01:42:21,815 --> 01:42:24,276
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know, Mr. Pippicelli, are you?

947
01:42:24,296 --> 01:42:26,257
[SPEAKER_11]: He's so good.

948
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:27,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

949
01:42:28,798 --> 01:42:33,080
[SPEAKER_11]: So we spent some time talking about the calendar for next year.

950
01:42:33,742 --> 01:42:41,546
[SPEAKER_11]: What we are here to put forward for recommendation is this option for the school calendar next year.

951
01:42:41,566 --> 01:42:49,849
[SPEAKER_11]: A few things to note as I'm framing this for school year 26-27, Labor Day is very late.

952
01:42:51,470 --> 01:43:00,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Labor Day, as you can see on this right here, is September 7th, which means per contracts,

953
01:43:02,312 --> 01:43:03,813
[SPEAKER_11]: come back to school the week before.

954
01:43:04,273 --> 01:43:07,754
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really for next year, the first week of September.

955
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:13,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically in a year, that return week is the last week of August.

956
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:16,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Next year, it would be the first week of September.

957
01:43:17,459 --> 01:43:23,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, the primary voting day is Tuesday, September 1st.

958
01:43:24,893 --> 01:43:50,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we are providing here is just a recommendation to pretty much follow the same structure that we have this year so that teachers would return and have their professional development days, the launch on Monday, August 31st and September 1st, and we're welcoming students on grades one through 12 on September 2nd.

959
01:43:51,123 --> 01:43:52,043
[SPEAKER_11]: This does make,

960
01:43:53,288 --> 01:43:57,492
[SPEAKER_11]: without snow days, the last day of school as June 23rd.

961
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:05,758
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we do have a snow day, we would have to tack it on to after June 23rd.

962
01:44:05,778 --> 01:44:11,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I also do want to be very transparent, as we've kind of discussed.

963
01:44:14,085 --> 01:44:21,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year when the calendar was presented, because of the way some of the holidays fell,

964
01:44:23,773 --> 01:44:46,909
[SPEAKER_11]: there was a recommendation to honor the high holy holidays for religious purposes, but have, I don't wanna say lesser, but for absence of a better word, not as high holy days to be in attendance.

965
01:44:47,854 --> 01:44:51,118
[SPEAKER_11]: That we are taking a similar approach to that for next year.

966
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:59,207
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do want to note that historically up until this year, Medford Public Schools has had Good Friday off.

967
01:44:59,908 --> 01:45:01,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is the first year.

968
01:45:02,701 --> 01:45:06,923
[SPEAKER_11]: that it is a day of school and not a day off.

969
01:45:07,763 --> 01:45:15,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this calendar proposal for next year also has Good Friday as being a day that school is in session.

970
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:20,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping we will be fine, but we also haven't

971
01:45:21,787 --> 01:45:24,289
[SPEAKER_11]: like experienced that day yet.

972
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:29,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm hoping that we're not going to encumber like a staffing issue.

973
01:45:30,274 --> 01:45:44,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to be very fully transparent that this calendar is being proposed but may potentially warrant a further conversation at some point down the road after we see what happens with that day this year.

974
01:45:47,462 --> 01:45:59,990
[SPEAKER_11]: And then other than that, the only piece with this is that there's a, a DESI regulation around when graduation can be and the distance between the high school graduation and the last day of school for the district.

975
01:46:00,451 --> 01:46:01,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can't be more than 12.

976
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:11,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So this means next year, for the class of 2027, the graduation, the earliest it could be would be Friday, June 4th.

977
01:46:15,055 --> 01:46:19,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would have to move it from the Wednesday to the Friday in compliance with the DESI regulations.

978
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, we're following pretty much the same structure as we are this year.

979
01:46:26,703 --> 01:46:31,307
[SPEAKER_11]: This was reviewed with the teacher's union during joint labor.

980
01:46:31,787 --> 01:46:35,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did have a discussion with union president Anthony Guillen today.

981
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:42,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And this option is in full compliance with the CBA, so they of course are in support of it.

982
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to answer any questions.

983
01:46:46,652 --> 01:46:48,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Galussi.

984
01:46:48,054 --> 01:46:51,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we've read today that you do want to have one more input session.

985
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:54,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you asking for a vote to table or you're looking for approval?

986
01:46:54,804 --> 01:46:55,966
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm looking for approval.

987
01:46:56,006 --> 01:46:56,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

988
01:46:57,428 --> 01:46:58,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation.

989
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:59,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo, then Member Graham.

990
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:06,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

991
01:47:07,205 --> 01:47:15,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say that we passed this policy in 2020, and this is the first year when the calendar was presented that it was accurate, so I want to thank you.

992
01:47:16,949 --> 01:47:29,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not an easy task to actually, because you're like, you know, I want to look at the dates for 2026, and it's like, oh, but I need 2027 for some of them, but 2026 for the ones that are after September 1st, so it is a little,

993
01:47:30,425 --> 01:47:32,386
[SPEAKER_04]: tedious and confusing sometimes.

994
01:47:32,887 --> 01:47:41,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And I take the, our policy and I take the proposed calendar and I go through and I, you know, ask Chat GPT when the date is on that year.

995
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:48,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And even I, after going through it, had a couple mistakes and I almost sent you a text saying, it's not right again.

996
01:47:48,498 --> 01:47:51,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't, cuz then I realized I was looking at the wrong year.

997
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do appreciate that that is correct.

998
01:47:56,874 --> 01:48:10,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I mean, we really, frankly, got very lucky this year around a lot of holidays were on Saturday, a lot of religious holidays that we have no school for were Saturday or, well, frankly, a lot of Saturday and Sunday ones.

999
01:48:12,382 --> 01:48:17,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So, from a school day's perspective, we got very lucky.

1000
01:48:19,006 --> 01:48:20,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, we got very unlucky.

1001
01:48:21,887 --> 01:48:23,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm glad we didn't have to do that.

1002
01:48:27,702 --> 01:48:29,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything else I wanted to say about this?

1003
01:48:29,783 --> 01:48:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just wanted to make a motion to approve option A as presented.

1004
01:48:35,604 --> 01:48:36,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval by Member Rousseau.

1005
01:48:36,945 --> 01:48:37,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

1006
01:48:40,045 --> 01:48:41,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a quick question.

1007
01:48:41,226 --> 01:48:53,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So the end of the last day of school being on June 23rd, am I correct that DESE requires us to have space for five snow days and so we are in compliance here?

1008
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:54,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1009
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:54,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1010
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:56,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1011
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:56,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1012
01:48:58,276 --> 01:49:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeld?

1013
01:49:02,957 --> 01:49:05,757
[SPEAKER_02]: A roll call, please, as I know two have to abstain.

1014
01:49:05,797 --> 01:49:06,078
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1015
01:49:06,098 --> 01:49:07,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to get sworn in tomorrow, officially.

1016
01:49:08,798 --> 01:49:09,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

1017
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:10,718
Abstain.

1018
01:49:12,419 --> 01:49:13,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Mastropoli?

1019
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:15,479
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry.

1020
01:49:15,559 --> 01:49:17,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olopade?

1021
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:17,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Abstain.

1022
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Parks?

1023
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:21,340
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1024
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

1025
01:49:22,341 --> 01:49:22,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1026
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau?

1027
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:23,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1028
01:49:24,128 --> 01:49:26,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two having to abstain.

1029
01:49:26,971 --> 01:49:28,132
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion is approved.

1030
01:49:28,212 --> 01:49:33,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Calendar option A has been adopted for the 2026-2027 school year.

1031
01:49:34,677 --> 01:49:35,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the copy.

1032
01:49:35,378 --> 01:49:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes right in my book.

1033
01:49:39,642 --> 01:49:48,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up we have the update from Member Graham, MCHSBC Chair, an update on the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

1034
01:49:49,711 --> 01:49:50,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1035
01:49:50,903 --> 01:49:51,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1036
01:49:52,504 --> 01:49:57,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.

1037
01:49:57,467 --> 01:50:12,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.

1038
01:50:12,677 --> 01:50:19,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.

1039
01:50:20,463 --> 01:50:26,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.

1040
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:29,433
[SPEAKER_07]: But they already were on board and working.

1041
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:39,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can

1042
01:50:41,206 --> 01:50:44,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.

1043
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:47,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.

1044
01:50:55,828 --> 01:51:03,010
[SPEAKER_07]: on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?

1045
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:04,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happens today?

1046
01:51:05,431 --> 01:51:06,311
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it happen?

1047
01:51:06,591 --> 01:51:07,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is the ledge?

1048
01:51:08,212 --> 01:51:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is the playing field?

1049
01:51:09,552 --> 01:51:10,833
[SPEAKER_07]: How does traffic flow?

1050
01:51:10,913 --> 01:51:12,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are the challenges?

1051
01:51:12,093 --> 01:51:13,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of that good stuff.

1052
01:51:14,474 --> 01:51:18,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to

1053
01:51:19,495 --> 01:51:22,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a really good question.

1054
01:51:22,037 --> 01:51:24,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a really good question.

1055
01:51:34,692 --> 01:51:38,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.

1056
01:51:39,337 --> 01:51:40,818
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been doing all of that work.

1057
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.

1058
01:51:48,566 --> 01:51:54,211
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.

1059
01:51:55,112 --> 01:52:01,194
[SPEAKER_07]: They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.

1060
01:52:01,714 --> 01:52:05,055
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.

1061
01:52:06,776 --> 01:52:09,757
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.

1062
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:17,999
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.

1063
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,560
[SPEAKER_07]: That work has been really interesting to watch.

1064
01:52:22,101 --> 01:52:25,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.

1065
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:32,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.

1066
01:52:32,584 --> 01:52:38,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.

1067
01:52:40,046 --> 01:52:47,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.

1068
01:52:47,673 --> 01:52:48,233
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do?

1069
01:52:48,313 --> 01:52:48,914
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you do it?

1070
01:52:49,034 --> 01:52:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you do it?

1071
01:52:50,735 --> 01:52:51,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that good stuff.

1072
01:52:52,056 --> 01:52:53,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that happened.

1073
01:52:53,137 --> 01:52:58,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.

1074
01:52:59,694 --> 01:53:10,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.

1075
01:53:10,598 --> 01:53:16,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?

1076
01:53:16,861 --> 01:53:18,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very educationally focused.

1077
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having

1078
01:53:24,395 --> 01:53:30,960
[SPEAKER_07]: grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.

1079
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:45,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.

1080
01:53:46,173 --> 01:53:49,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It started with a shadow day and

1081
01:53:51,323 --> 01:53:58,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.

1082
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:03,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Arrival, lunch, passing periods.

1083
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:05,470
[SPEAKER_07]: like all of it.

1084
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:05,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1085
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:15,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.

1086
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.

1087
01:54:22,744 --> 01:54:24,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they saw four schools in a day.

1088
01:54:24,826 --> 01:54:25,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right.

1089
01:54:27,548 --> 01:54:31,031
[SPEAKER_07]: To help our team understand what's possible.

1090
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:31,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1091
01:54:31,412 --> 01:54:32,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Because many people

1092
01:54:33,842 --> 01:54:38,163
[SPEAKER_07]: have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.

1093
01:54:38,683 --> 01:54:43,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.

1094
01:54:43,444 --> 01:54:53,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.

1095
01:54:53,086 --> 01:55:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,

1096
01:55:02,543 --> 01:55:08,828
[SPEAKER_07]: and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.

1097
01:55:09,008 --> 01:55:11,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to be part of that two-day session.

1098
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.

1099
01:55:17,114 --> 01:55:21,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.

1100
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:25,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.

1101
01:55:25,381 --> 01:55:28,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was super skillful and artful.

1102
01:55:30,865 --> 01:55:41,274
[SPEAKER_07]: just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.

1103
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:52,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.

1104
01:55:52,625 --> 01:55:56,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like

1105
01:55:57,498 --> 01:56:08,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.

1106
01:56:09,405 --> 01:56:15,046
[SPEAKER_07]: what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?

1107
01:56:15,866 --> 01:56:20,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.

1108
01:56:21,207 --> 01:56:28,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.

1109
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:34,690
[SPEAKER_07]: But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate

1110
01:56:35,592 --> 01:56:37,654
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we going to do in the building?

1111
01:56:37,854 --> 01:56:39,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are we going to do it?

1112
01:56:40,297 --> 01:56:44,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.

1113
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:52,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.

1114
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:56,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?

1115
01:56:56,333 --> 01:56:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it an open space or a closed space?

1116
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:20,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is

1117
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:29,068
[SPEAKER_07]: a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.

1118
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:30,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Like why do you need a new space, right?

1119
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:36,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.

1120
01:57:38,482 --> 01:57:45,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.

1121
01:57:46,488 --> 01:57:51,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.

1122
01:57:53,374 --> 01:58:03,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.

1123
01:58:03,922 --> 01:58:06,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have this set of sessions.

1124
01:58:06,103 --> 01:58:12,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?

1125
01:58:13,685 --> 01:58:26,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.

1126
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:28,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And

1127
01:58:29,555 --> 01:58:32,797
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.

1128
01:58:33,578 --> 01:58:37,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.

1129
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, fair, right?

1130
01:58:40,542 --> 01:58:44,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.

1131
01:58:45,705 --> 01:58:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.

1132
01:58:50,568 --> 01:58:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were like, why?

1133
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:54,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Why wouldn't you do it there?

1134
01:58:54,691 --> 01:58:56,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.

1135
01:58:57,716 --> 01:59:05,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,

1136
01:59:07,023 --> 01:59:14,128
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.

1137
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:18,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?

1138
01:59:18,591 --> 01:59:20,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?

1139
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:24,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?

1140
01:59:25,535 --> 01:59:32,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,

1141
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say

1142
01:59:57,863 --> 02:00:01,205
[SPEAKER_07]: do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?

1143
02:00:01,265 --> 02:00:02,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is like, absolutely not.

1144
02:00:02,666 --> 02:00:12,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.

1145
02:00:13,072 --> 02:00:16,995
[SPEAKER_07]: So out of all of that will come an educational plan.

1146
02:00:18,254 --> 02:00:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.

1147
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be introducing it then.

1148
02:00:26,481 --> 02:00:28,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So SMMA will be here with us.

1149
02:00:29,163 --> 02:00:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.

1150
02:00:34,528 --> 02:00:41,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,

1151
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:48,080
[SPEAKER_07]: is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.

1152
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.

1153
02:00:53,665 --> 02:00:56,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.

1154
02:00:58,689 --> 02:01:04,334
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.

1155
02:01:05,555 --> 02:01:07,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Preliminary design plan.

1156
02:01:09,877 --> 02:01:14,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And that PDP includes the educational plan.

1157
02:01:14,622 --> 02:01:19,527
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.

1158
02:01:20,188 --> 02:01:25,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space

1159
02:01:26,527 --> 02:01:37,903
[SPEAKER_07]: concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.

1160
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:41,961
[SPEAKER_07]: That work is for the building committee to do.

1161
02:01:42,042 --> 02:01:47,165
[SPEAKER_07]: So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.

1162
02:01:47,185 --> 02:01:51,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.

1163
02:01:51,368 --> 02:02:00,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.

1164
02:02:01,375 --> 02:02:05,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from

1165
02:02:06,759 --> 02:02:09,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.

1166
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:23,165
[SPEAKER_07]: The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.

1167
02:02:23,365 --> 02:02:25,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Where will the building go and what will it look like?

1168
02:02:27,055 --> 02:02:32,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?

1169
02:02:32,138 --> 02:02:39,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.

1170
02:02:39,363 --> 02:02:56,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.

1171
02:02:57,094 --> 02:03:00,316
[SPEAKER_07]: so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?

1172
02:03:00,356 --> 02:03:16,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.

1173
02:03:16,726 --> 02:03:23,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.

1174
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:27,672
[SPEAKER_07]: lots of chances for community input in those sessions.

1175
02:03:28,893 --> 02:03:47,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.

1176
02:03:49,573 --> 02:03:54,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.

1177
02:03:54,257 --> 02:03:57,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.

1178
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Translation services will be available.

1179
02:04:00,643 --> 02:04:08,870
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.

1180
02:04:08,991 --> 02:04:14,596
[SPEAKER_07]: They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks

1181
02:04:15,236 --> 02:04:23,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.

1182
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:34,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.

1183
02:04:35,102 --> 02:04:36,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll collect a lot of questions.

1184
02:04:36,742 --> 02:04:39,283
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.

1185
02:04:39,903 --> 02:04:51,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.

1186
02:04:52,996 --> 02:05:06,783
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.

1187
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:11,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll be a place for public input.

1188
02:05:11,265 --> 02:05:20,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.

1189
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:22,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on plans for that.

1190
02:05:23,352 --> 02:05:38,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.

1191
02:05:38,987 --> 02:05:45,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.

1192
02:05:46,703 --> 02:05:54,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?

1193
02:05:54,629 --> 02:05:56,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the building could be here, it could be there.

1194
02:05:56,451 --> 02:06:05,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.

1195
02:06:05,818 --> 02:06:09,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?

1196
02:06:09,681 --> 02:06:10,962
[SPEAKER_07]: How many classrooms is it?

1197
02:06:11,482 --> 02:06:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,

1198
02:06:36,358 --> 02:06:42,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.

1199
02:06:42,383 --> 02:06:44,665
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the ed plan is so important.

1200
02:06:45,346 --> 02:06:52,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.

1201
02:06:52,272 --> 02:07:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.

1202
02:07:03,003 --> 02:07:04,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's false.

1203
02:07:04,968 --> 02:07:06,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost completely false.

1204
02:07:06,912 --> 02:07:09,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's one program where that is true.

1205
02:07:10,379 --> 02:07:11,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like a marginal change.

1206
02:07:12,609 --> 02:07:18,854
[SPEAKER_07]: In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.

1207
02:07:19,634 --> 02:07:26,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.

1208
02:07:28,001 --> 02:07:35,466
[SPEAKER_07]: It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan

1209
02:07:37,488 --> 02:07:41,290
[SPEAKER_07]: is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?

1210
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:45,973
[SPEAKER_07]: One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.

1211
02:07:46,153 --> 02:08:01,222
[SPEAKER_07]: They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.

1212
02:08:02,102 --> 02:08:21,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.

1213
02:08:21,855 --> 02:08:22,355
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the other one?

1214
02:08:22,816 --> 02:08:23,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Fitness center.

1215
02:08:24,837 --> 02:08:27,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it's not like marginally bigger.

1216
02:08:28,819 --> 02:08:32,141
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.

1217
02:08:32,201 --> 02:08:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.

1218
02:08:36,823 --> 02:08:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think

1219
02:08:43,987 --> 02:08:56,574
[SPEAKER_07]: part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.

1220
02:08:57,995 --> 02:09:07,381
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.

1221
02:09:07,441 --> 02:09:10,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a lot of really not glorious,

1222
02:09:11,543 --> 02:09:23,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not

1223
02:09:23,857 --> 02:09:30,485
[SPEAKER_07]: the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.

1224
02:09:30,545 --> 02:09:36,653
[SPEAKER_07]: They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.

1225
02:09:36,693 --> 02:09:42,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.

1226
02:09:42,798 --> 02:09:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.

1227
02:09:52,245 --> 02:09:56,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.

1228
02:09:56,428 --> 02:10:06,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.

1229
02:10:06,435 --> 02:10:09,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, where'd it go?

1230
02:10:12,612 --> 02:10:19,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.

1231
02:10:19,296 --> 02:10:22,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.

1232
02:10:22,497 --> 02:10:26,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.

1233
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,862
[SPEAKER_07]: One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.

1234
02:10:31,402 --> 02:10:37,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.

1235
02:10:38,446 --> 02:10:40,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And to create a higher quality,

1236
02:10:42,248 --> 02:10:50,271
[SPEAKER_07]: video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.

1237
02:10:50,412 --> 02:11:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.

1238
02:11:02,317 --> 02:11:07,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.

1239
02:11:09,251 --> 02:11:16,278
[SPEAKER_07]: On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.

1240
02:11:16,539 --> 02:11:18,300
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we're going to start to see concepts.

1241
02:11:18,821 --> 02:11:26,929
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.

1242
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:29,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we will

1243
02:11:31,938 --> 02:11:37,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.

1244
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,162
[SPEAKER_07]: That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.

1245
02:11:43,402 --> 02:11:44,763
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.

1246
02:11:45,023 --> 02:11:52,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.

1247
02:11:53,593 --> 02:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.

1248
02:11:56,838 --> 02:12:00,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.

1249
02:12:01,085 --> 02:12:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.

1250
02:12:05,745 --> 02:12:24,139
[SPEAKER_07]: On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.

1251
02:12:25,695 --> 02:12:31,179
[SPEAKER_07]: On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.

1252
02:12:31,239 --> 02:12:36,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.

1253
02:12:37,784 --> 02:12:41,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.

1254
02:12:42,087 --> 02:12:47,991
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.

1255
02:12:49,171 --> 02:12:54,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.

1256
02:12:56,497 --> 02:13:02,465
[SPEAKER_07]: That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.

1257
02:13:03,026 --> 02:13:04,487
[SPEAKER_07]: By June we will have one.

1258
02:13:05,048 --> 02:13:10,255
[SPEAKER_07]: So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish

1259
02:13:11,278 --> 02:13:13,439
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?

1260
02:13:13,579 --> 02:13:18,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.

1261
02:13:19,861 --> 02:13:31,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.

1262
02:13:31,844 --> 02:13:33,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us what you think about them.

1263
02:13:33,385 --> 02:13:37,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.

1264
02:13:38,278 --> 02:13:43,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.

1265
02:13:44,944 --> 02:13:47,585
[SPEAKER_07]: where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.

1266
02:13:47,665 --> 02:13:50,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the next three months of this project.

1267
02:13:51,546 --> 02:14:05,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?

1268
02:14:07,011 --> 02:14:10,232
[SPEAKER_07]: No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.

1269
02:14:11,253 --> 02:14:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: and cost.

1270
02:14:12,955 --> 02:14:18,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.

1271
02:14:20,426 --> 02:14:24,892
[SPEAKER_07]: We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized

1272
02:14:25,537 --> 02:14:37,562
[SPEAKER_07]: doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.

1273
02:14:37,902 --> 02:14:48,466
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.

1274
02:14:51,207 --> 02:14:58,332
[SPEAKER_07]: There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.

1275
02:14:58,392 --> 02:15:08,839
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.

1276
02:15:08,959 --> 02:15:13,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.

1277
02:15:13,982 --> 02:15:19,626
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.

1278
02:15:20,327 --> 02:15:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeldt.

1279
02:15:23,595 --> 02:15:23,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1280
02:15:24,175 --> 02:15:25,697
[SPEAKER_06]: This is super exciting.

1281
02:15:26,257 --> 02:15:26,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, finally.

1282
02:15:26,838 --> 02:15:26,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1283
02:15:27,978 --> 02:15:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited about this.

1284
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my first question is, can we borrow some of that visioning session for our strategic planning meetings?

1285
02:15:34,003 --> 02:15:35,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that sounds amazing.

1286
02:15:36,725 --> 02:15:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really wonderful.

1287
02:15:39,547 --> 02:15:44,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think some people in the room were like, we need to do this with all the teachers in the high school.

1288
02:15:44,171 --> 02:15:47,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there was a lot of energy around what could happen.

1289
02:15:47,854 --> 02:15:51,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one of the recognitions and Mike,

1290
02:15:52,197 --> 02:16:03,090
[SPEAKER_07]: who is the head of the organization, said, you know, when you hear stories about schools that built something and then they don't use it, right?

1291
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:04,712
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear that all the time.

1292
02:16:06,233 --> 02:16:09,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said that happens because

1293
02:16:12,444 --> 02:16:15,086
[SPEAKER_07]: people make a list of their hopes and dreams and their wishes.

1294
02:16:15,647 --> 02:16:18,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, it's gonna be so great if we can have these things.

1295
02:16:18,749 --> 02:16:24,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everybody closes up the list of hopes and dreams and wishes and waits for the building to come.

1296
02:16:25,589 --> 02:16:29,313
[SPEAKER_07]: and sort of hopes that the building is going to transform them.

1297
02:16:30,214 --> 02:16:32,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And the building is not going to do that.

1298
02:16:33,518 --> 02:16:41,787
[SPEAKER_07]: The transformation has to happen by people, because the things that have to change actually are the people, right?

1299
02:16:41,887 --> 02:16:44,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did talk a bit about

1300
02:16:46,391 --> 02:16:59,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we have this like initial ed plan developed, what kind of professional development opportunities and collaboration sessions should be happening to really start to collaboratively unfold?

1301
02:17:01,538 --> 02:17:05,941
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do before, you know, whenever this building opens?

1302
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:08,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And when can we do those things?

1303
02:17:08,833 --> 02:17:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: and what supports are needed.

1304
02:17:10,994 --> 02:17:15,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is other work that this team at the educational planner does do.

1305
02:17:16,776 --> 02:17:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly was like, I'm happy to give you suggestions.

1306
02:17:19,917 --> 02:17:21,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to tell you how to do this yourself.

1307
02:17:21,837 --> 02:17:22,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to help you do it.

1308
02:17:24,178 --> 02:17:35,082
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think to the point, like the work that he did to sort of unposition everybody from whatever it is that they thought that they were coming in to tell us,

1309
02:17:36,322 --> 02:17:41,904
[SPEAKER_07]: is important, and it's skillful work, so really thinking about the next steps I think is important.

1310
02:17:42,444 --> 02:17:53,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll use a lot of the same techniques in our strategic planning sessions, albeit we have a little bit less of a controlled audience, so we'll navigate for that.

1311
02:17:53,946 --> 02:17:54,947
[SPEAKER_06]: That was quite curated.

1312
02:17:55,047 --> 02:17:55,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yes.

1313
02:17:56,207 --> 02:18:04,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and so I think when you have a curated audience, you can really direct, and we're also gonna try to do our strategic planning sessions in two hours,

1314
02:18:05,749 --> 02:18:06,430
[SPEAKER_07]: We had two days.

1315
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:13,338
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna we're gonna have to like move a little differently, but many of the same like Concepts will apply for sure.

1316
02:18:13,398 --> 02:18:25,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I wish there a way that people could that we could capture that and share that in vignettes somehow Yeah, and I think to your point like one of the things that we can talk about is how do we capture that because I think it was really

1317
02:18:26,293 --> 02:18:31,959
[SPEAKER_07]: very cool like what happened and I think there is maybe an opportunity to do that that we can talk about.

1318
02:18:31,979 --> 02:18:44,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean I'm just thinking I got so my my children weren't in that but I I've been getting texts from today it was the the high school is colder than outside and the other day it was I taught an architect how to French braid so

1319
02:18:46,652 --> 02:18:49,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's really wonderful to see this student centering.

1320
02:18:49,635 --> 02:18:56,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think most of my other questions now are around this communication out to the community.

1321
02:18:56,823 --> 02:19:04,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually really glad that Simon brought up this idea, this question of communicating with people beyond the school community.

1322
02:19:04,131 --> 02:19:07,194
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of strategies for doing this, and I would actually love it

1323
02:19:09,115 --> 02:19:16,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to get this information out about the forum, whether it's through talking points or through emails through the schools.

1324
02:19:16,298 --> 02:19:29,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that doesn't necessarily go to the broader Medford community, but I'm thinking about, I'm looking at all the elementary principals here in the audience, but these are the students who are going to be living in this building and middle school as well.

1325
02:19:30,563 --> 02:19:58,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be great to get that notice out in advance of Wednesday, but I'm wondering if we can put together some sort of backpack flyer on these dates with the disclaimer of, subject to New England weather and whatnot, and here's how to subscribe, if there's a newsletter going out, here's how to stay informed about this project, if we could get something physical out to families soon, that would be really

1326
02:19:59,811 --> 02:20:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so a couple of things that are also brewing there.

1327
02:20:03,193 --> 02:20:04,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send a reminder.

1328
02:20:05,555 --> 02:20:12,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Will's been in touch with Steve in the mayor's office to do a blast about this meeting.

1329
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:13,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1330
02:20:14,301 --> 02:20:22,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The community liaisons will be communicating about this meeting to their communities who need translation services.

1331
02:20:23,758 --> 02:20:33,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as we talk about important dates, the other thing we talked about with the community liaisons today was like giving people just that exact list of like here's what's coming.

1332
02:20:33,683 --> 02:20:40,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we put that together, we can do any number of things with it, including we could stuff some flyers and backpacks.

1333
02:20:40,526 --> 02:20:44,108
[SPEAKER_07]: So the communication about the meeting has gone out in a couple of different ways.

1334
02:20:44,308 --> 02:20:46,729
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send a reminder, but then we can put this like,

1335
02:20:47,561 --> 02:20:57,351
[SPEAKER_07]: like Trail of Breadcrumbs sort of meeting schedule out to people in backpacks for our elementary students and like push that out through all of these channels as well.

1336
02:20:57,411 --> 02:21:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think getting that in a school-based way may engage some of our families who

1337
02:21:02,077 --> 02:21:06,320
[SPEAKER_06]: with all due respect may not follow the weekly memo quite as closely.

1338
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1339
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:27,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the other thing that we will be talking about is how to create a mailing list newsletter that can be used for broader communications outside of the school community so that those folks in the community who want to be explicitly notified about things on the building committee that will do that.

1340
02:21:27,872 --> 02:21:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a whole bunch of communication oriented things that

1341
02:21:30,694 --> 02:21:36,256
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll start to like get going so that we can create this like bigger base of people who are informed.

1342
02:21:36,496 --> 02:21:36,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1343
02:21:36,696 --> 02:21:39,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just and I think that my final question was around that.

1344
02:21:39,997 --> 02:21:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when you started there was a communications and community engagement subcommittee and just making sure that's still active and robust.

1345
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:50,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything that this body I know half of

1346
02:21:51,575 --> 02:21:55,496
[SPEAKER_06]: A good half of the people, well, more people in this room are on that committee than not.

1347
02:21:56,917 --> 02:22:01,678
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been on multiple building committees in Somerville and you're a facilities project manager.

1348
02:22:01,698 --> 02:22:04,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm the only person here who isn't involved in building work.

1349
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:09,821
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever we can do to support that committee in getting the word out.

1350
02:22:10,081 --> 02:22:10,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1351
02:22:10,541 --> 02:22:18,484
[SPEAKER_07]: That subcommittee has not met in a bit because we've been turning our attention to all of the existing condition work.

1352
02:22:19,525 --> 02:22:32,876
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there is an opportunity to reconvene that team and I will talk to the members of that team about doing something that can push out like maybe a monthly newsletter or something that can be authored by a subset of the building committee.

1353
02:22:33,016 --> 02:22:34,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll talk about that.

1354
02:22:34,357 --> 02:22:35,018
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

1355
02:22:35,118 --> 02:22:39,601
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal here is that nobody should be surprised when debt exclusion shows up.

1356
02:22:41,563 --> 02:22:42,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, absolutely.

1357
02:22:42,924 --> 02:22:43,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1358
02:22:44,589 --> 02:22:45,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair point.

1359
02:22:45,430 --> 02:22:48,953
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try really hard to get everybody.

1360
02:22:49,033 --> 02:22:52,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Or when they're surprised that they can figure out where to go to learn more.

1361
02:22:52,276 --> 02:22:53,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for all the work.

1362
02:22:53,617 --> 02:22:56,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you to everyone who has been doing this work, because I know it's a lot.

1363
02:22:57,381 --> 02:22:59,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just, I'm so excited.

1364
02:23:02,266 --> 02:23:02,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1365
02:23:02,846 --> 02:23:03,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to say a few words.

1366
02:23:09,509 --> 02:23:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again, Simon Alcindor, 44 Tainter Street.

1367
02:23:12,671 --> 02:23:14,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a couple of quick questions.

1368
02:23:16,053 --> 02:23:23,616
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I know you briefly touched on transportation when you were talking about the exploratory phase of this.

1369
02:23:23,957 --> 02:23:30,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any more details on what they've been doing exactly, especially when it comes to traffic with it being a sort of isolated place?

1370
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:31,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of interested in that.

1371
02:23:32,321 --> 02:23:35,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that's come up in a couple of different ways.

1372
02:23:36,224 --> 02:23:41,568
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to all the things that I talked about, I forgot to mention that we have four advisory committees.

1373
02:23:41,608 --> 02:23:50,975
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like 70 or so people across the four committees talking about who are community members who are joining us in a targeted capacity.

1374
02:23:51,516 --> 02:23:55,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of those subcommittees is about site safety and security.

1375
02:23:55,759 --> 02:23:59,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And transportation came up in that meeting just before the holiday break.

1376
02:24:00,542 --> 02:24:03,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the conversations that we're having about transportation are a few things.

1377
02:24:04,804 --> 02:24:12,608
[SPEAKER_07]: One is about the like one way in and one way out nature of where our school is.

1378
02:24:13,108 --> 02:24:22,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And talking about, we heard from the chief, the police chief in particular, that like emergency access is something we need to explore, and the team is talking about that.

1379
02:24:23,713 --> 02:24:32,126
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also talking about creating better flow of traffic around the building, wherever that building sort of becomes situated.

1380
02:24:32,246 --> 02:24:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that the architects commented on is that

1381
02:24:37,233 --> 02:24:45,999
[SPEAKER_07]: The way the property is laid out now, it prioritizes parking lots over flow.

1382
02:24:46,939 --> 02:24:54,604
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the problems that we have can be alleviated with an attention to flow around the property.

1383
02:24:54,804 --> 02:24:59,566
[SPEAKER_07]: The example that came up in our visioning session was students were saying,

1384
02:25:00,867 --> 02:25:12,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to leave my last class a few minutes early because I have to get to the bus and it's across the school building and if I don't get there, then I don't get a seat or I can't get on the bus because it's crowded, right?

1385
02:25:13,137 --> 02:25:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, and by the way, that's the same, everybody leaves out of that same exit, right?

1386
02:25:18,941 --> 02:25:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're getting picked up in a car, if you're getting picked up on a bus, if you're walking home, everyone leaves through the same exit.

1387
02:25:26,447 --> 02:25:27,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's madness, right?

1388
02:25:28,068 --> 02:25:31,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they were like, can the buses be somewhere else?

1389
02:25:31,809 --> 02:25:33,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the students ask.

1390
02:25:33,269 --> 02:25:35,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we just put the buses somewhere else?

1391
02:25:35,870 --> 02:25:39,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of the answer on our current property is like, not really.

1392
02:25:40,292 --> 02:25:45,734
[SPEAKER_07]: But in a new building where we're thinking about, OK, how do people arrive at this school?

1393
02:25:45,914 --> 02:25:47,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they arrive on foot.

1394
02:25:47,474 --> 02:25:50,095
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, it's a very steep pitch, right?

1395
02:25:50,655 --> 02:25:55,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're going to arrive on bike, like, it's a very steep pitch to get up that hill.

1396
02:25:56,739 --> 02:25:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not a biker, but I couldn't do it.

1397
02:25:59,522 --> 02:26:01,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, how many people are we deterring?

1398
02:26:01,965 --> 02:26:04,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's a very steep pitch, and is there an answer for that?

1399
02:26:05,229 --> 02:26:13,901
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, like, how do we make it so that we're not, like, everybody convening into the same, like, choke point, essentially, which is what happens today?

1400
02:26:14,441 --> 02:26:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that is being discussed and even things have come up like we probably do need to talk to the MBTA about the timing of the buses and is there a shift there that can be made to create better access.

1401
02:26:27,424 --> 02:26:34,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know when you start talking about those kinds of things students rightfully will say there's no late bus.

1402
02:26:34,505 --> 02:26:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I try one of the students said to me I try hard to stay to not stay after school because if I stay after school I have to walk two miles home.

1403
02:26:43,452 --> 02:26:44,239
[SPEAKER_07]: and it takes me an hour.

1404
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:46,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So because there's no late bus.

1405
02:26:46,901 --> 02:27:02,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So that sort of, like a lot of things come up in these sessions that don't have, like a late bus has nothing to do with whether this building is old or new, but is coming up in the context of like the collective problem that we need to solve.

1406
02:27:02,669 --> 02:27:10,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, very much lots of conversation around transportation is happening and I'm excited to see like the flow.

1407
02:27:10,193 --> 02:27:13,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I go around the back corner of that hairpin turn, I'm like,

1408
02:27:15,062 --> 02:27:15,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did this?

1409
02:27:16,143 --> 02:27:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it so tight?

1410
02:27:17,503 --> 02:27:20,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I can barely get my giant car around there, much less two cars.

1411
02:27:20,925 --> 02:27:23,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the kinds of things.

1412
02:27:23,086 --> 02:27:24,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you think about if you're going...

1413
02:27:27,876 --> 02:27:29,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It does, it does.

1414
02:27:30,138 --> 02:27:31,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bus darts can work a miracle.

1415
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:40,827
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you go around the back of the building to drop a kid off at the field, you have to turn around and go back the way that you came.

1416
02:27:41,128 --> 02:27:50,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the kinds of flow conversations that I'm really hopeful will be alleviated in a significant way when we start talking about how could this new building be laid out.

1417
02:27:54,665 --> 02:28:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just like separately, like is this going to be on like, are the meetings for like the committee going to be on like the city events calendar and that?

1418
02:28:02,987 --> 02:28:03,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1419
02:28:03,087 --> 02:28:05,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I did notice that they're, at least not the one on Wednesday, is it?

1420
02:28:06,248 --> 02:28:06,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1421
02:28:06,608 --> 02:28:07,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

1422
02:28:07,189 --> 02:28:08,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a work in progress.

1423
02:28:08,469 --> 02:28:10,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So the holiday has sort of gotten our way.

1424
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:17,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Will has been putting all those things on the calendar, on the MPS calendar and has shared it with the city so that they can be there too.

1425
02:28:17,411 --> 02:28:17,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1426
02:28:17,671 --> 02:28:17,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1427
02:28:18,192 --> 02:28:18,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1428
02:28:18,832 --> 02:28:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Anytime.

1429
02:28:19,732 --> 02:28:20,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1430
02:28:20,312 --> 02:28:23,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Graham, for the update.

1431
02:28:24,488 --> 02:28:27,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll work on putting this in the city newsletter and robocall as well.

1432
02:28:30,393 --> 02:28:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not have any presentations of the Student Advisory Council or presentations of the public.

1433
02:28:35,057 --> 02:28:41,583
[SPEAKER_02]: We gonna skip also continue business, new business, reports requested, and I'm gonna go right to condolences.

1434
02:28:43,064 --> 02:28:43,685
[SPEAKER_02]: The members.

1435
02:29:08,917 --> 02:29:15,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to just say that so the public can hear?

1436
02:29:16,203 --> 02:29:16,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1437
02:29:19,225 --> 02:29:20,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1438
02:29:21,186 --> 02:29:31,134
[SPEAKER_08]: We meet after school at the high school, and so I know that some members have expressed interest in sitting in on some of our meetings.

1439
02:29:32,035 --> 02:29:33,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get back to you on that.

1440
02:29:33,816 --> 02:29:35,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, if any of you,

1441
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:50,317
[SPEAKER_08]: want to express concerns or sort of want an avenue through which to sample a specific concern you have, especially in the high school community, come to us.

1442
02:29:50,437 --> 02:29:51,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be happy to help.

1443
02:29:51,458 --> 02:29:54,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah.

1444
02:29:54,582 --> 02:29:54,802
