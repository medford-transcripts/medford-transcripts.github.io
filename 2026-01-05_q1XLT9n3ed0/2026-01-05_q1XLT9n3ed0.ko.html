 Good evening.
 So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.
 This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.
 always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.
 My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.
 None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.
 A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.
 This work is very demanding and it is very complex.
 and it keeps you on your toes.
 And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.
 And it is work that you take home with you.
 Yet it is carried out.
 in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.
 I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.
 Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.
 I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.
 Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.
 I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.
 The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.
 Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.
 I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.
 On the next slide, please.
 What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.
 So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.
 The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 During that time, we began to work
 a lot on our instructional excellence.
 We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.
 That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.
 You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.
 creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.
 It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.
 As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.
 This spoke about the work that I had done really working on
 the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.
 All of that to bring with me to this position.
 If we could please go to the next slide.
 This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.
 So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.
 I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence
 through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.
 I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.
 So to begin, our core values
 were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.
 They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.
 These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.
 So there is collaborative effort.
 and input put into the core values.
 Next slide, please.
 Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.
 We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.
 And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.
 So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.
 Who are we?
 How do we lead?
 What we expect?
 And how do we communicate?
 Next slide, please.
 So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.
 When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,
 a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.
 Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.
 uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.
 My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.
 That was the work that really began.
 It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.
 When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.
 Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.
 This slide talks about that.
 I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.
 It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.
 and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.
 I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.
 It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.
 This is something that is
 still growing.
 This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.
 It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.
 We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.
 They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.
 We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.
 We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.
 I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.
 This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful
 negotiations with the teachers.
 And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.
 And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.
 And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.
 And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,
 That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.
 And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.
 And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.
 This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.
 It also brought us recognition and a highlight
 from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.
 And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,
 on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.
 Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.
 Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.
 And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.
 So I do think it's important to note we've had a big
 reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
 My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.
 They're bringing with them years of
 experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.
 With that, I was very intentional.
 I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.
 and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.
 So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in
 her permanent position.
 We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.
 That's really helped to stabilize the district.
 It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.
 But they also started mid to late August.
 So we are still in the stages of building
 what we know we need to do.
 A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.
 The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.
 So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.
 But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.
 And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,
 is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.
 I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.
 Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Ruseau in all of the bargaining units.
 There was a significant amount of work done last year.
 We're still going with some other units.
 Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.
 So, strengthening operational foundations.
 What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.
 For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.
 Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.
 On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.
 Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.
 So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.
 in the short time he's been here so far.
 So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.
 This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.
 This has been part of ongoing conversations.
 Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.
 Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.
 That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.
 The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.
 Heating and roof leaks.
 par for the course in the past year.
 There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.
 We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.
 Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.
 A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.
 Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.
 To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered
 speedily through Amazon.
 And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.
 But you just don't know what's going to happen.
 And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.
 The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.
 Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.
 Strengthening safety.
 So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.
 Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.
 What that has looked like is an update.
 and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.
 This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.
 to mostly fruition.
 We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their
 ability to come in and out of work.
 So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.
 School-based and district-level safety committees.
 So those have begun.
 Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.
 And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.
 And I think he had a meeting today.
 This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.
 It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.
 And then lastly for operations would be community schools.
 This is an ongoing.
 area of focus and review.
 So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.
 That's mostly the rental of our buildings.
 It also sees our summer programming summer fun.
 but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.
 So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.
 Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating
 a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.
 We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start
 We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.
 That is an area where it wasn't
 completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.
 I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.
 And for them, some of this came as a surprise.
 So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.
 So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.
 Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.
 Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.
 That through line is our shared sense of belonging.
 It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are
 mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.
 So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that
 may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.
 So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so
 critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.
 And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.
 It was used for instruction.
 And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.
 more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.
 It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support
 is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.
 At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what
 individuals need.
 That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.
 And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging
 CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.
 And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day
 Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.
 dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.
 So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.
 Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.
 And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.
 High quality instructional materials
 make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.
 Next slide.
 Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.
 This is work that
 Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.
 We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.
 We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.
 We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students
 have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.
 We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.
 It's that transfer.
 Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.
 And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.
 The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.
 and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.
 Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.
 So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.
 She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.
 She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders
 and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.
 That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.
 They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.
 This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.
 Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.
 But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.
 This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.
 And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,
 is progress monitoring their students.
 Everyone has a caseload.
 We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.
 And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.
 Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.
 I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data
 In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.
 Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.
 One of this has been some of my favorite.
 I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year
 twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.
 And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,
 means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.
 with teachers in buildings.
 And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 She's had several meetings with them.
 OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.
 This is
 a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.
 So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.
 On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.
 MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.
 We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.
 And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.
 So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.
 We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment
 Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.
 And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.
 But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor
 is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.
 And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the
 caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.
 The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.
 Communication and partnership.
 In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.
 I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.
 It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.
 With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.
 And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.
 expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.
 We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.
 Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.
 Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that
 you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.
 This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 Administrators.
 Yes, yes.
 School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.
 When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.
 We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.
 And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.
 The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.
 I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.
 I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.
 We have some upcoming forums this month.
 But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,
 the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.
 So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.
 And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.
 We are very mindful though of our search committees.
 So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.
 So that is something that we have committed to
 before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.
 And there's the task force committee.
 So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.
 As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.
 who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.
 I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.
 I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.
 It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.
 So it's important that we hear from
 from all voices.
 An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.
 And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.
 And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.
 MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.
 And then just like one example of a district-based one is
 The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.
 I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.
 Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.
 I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.
 But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.
 But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.
 So that is ongoing work for myself.
 But I have really
 committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.
 I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.
 Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,
 but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.
 It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.
 And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 I just want to make sure that I am
 working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.
 And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.
 Next slide, please.
 So with all this said, planning for the future.
 So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.
 With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.
 They are goals that we want to maintain.
 It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.
 And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.
 So first, our continuing priorities.
 These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.
 The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.
 that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.
 So strengthening those supports for students
 so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.
 And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.
 Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.
 So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.
 And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.
 Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.
 also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.
 So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.
 I think that's an important thing to note.
 So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.
 And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.
 So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.
 And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.
 And I think
 each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.
 And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.
 I did highlight this in my
 report of interim findings.
 That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.
 So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.
 Enhancing communication and community trust.
 So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures
 making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.
 All of that is continuous work.
 and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.
 We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I
 it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.
 So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing
 And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.
 How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.
 That's work that will be continuing.
 Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.
 and how they're working with them.
 That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.
 And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.
 And our CBA before,
 did not have any layers of educator leadership.
 And now it does.
 And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.
 And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.
 That is work that is ongoing for us.
 Now moving to work that our new goals.
 And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.
 So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.
 This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.
 But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.
 One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.
 I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.
 This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction
 available effectively and meaningfully for students.
 That is work that is critical.
 the implementation of open architects.
 So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.
 And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.
 Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.
 So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.
 Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff
 at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.
 And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.
 And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.
 Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.
 This is a true goal here.
 Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.
 Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.
 I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.
 We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.
 And that is wonderful.
 And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.
 There might be one at the elementary.
 But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.
 Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.
 The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.
 She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think
 her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.
 But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.
 And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been
 Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.
 And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.
 Once we have a process, we find a way to
 fine tune and make it better.
 Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.
 I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision
 and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.
 Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.
 It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.
 And it's through the MSBA forum.
 And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.
 We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're
 getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.
 And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.
 So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.
 It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.
 And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.
 And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

 하지만 먼저 오늘은 매우 신나고 소리가 매우 강하다는 점을 먼저 말씀드리고 싶습니다.

 그런데 오늘 내 딸이 학교에 지각해서 우리가 받은 이메일에 있는 두 문장을 읽고 싶습니다.
 우리는 귀하와 귀하의 학생들이 참여 문제를 줄일 수 있도록 돕기 위해 최선을 다하고 있음을 인식하십시오.
 지각으로 인해 학교에서 중요한 교육 및 학습 기회를 놓칠 수 있으므로 우리는 학생들이 지각하는 것을 우려하고 있습니다.
 언제 이렇게 바뀌었는지는 모르겠습니다.
 아마도 올해인 것 같아요.
 하지만 이것이 왜 이 모든 것이 중요한지에 대한 좋은 예라고 생각합니다. 이메일에 추가 정보가 있지만 DESE 준수와 관련된 내용은 없으며 검사가 이를 찾지 못했지만 누구입니까?

 그래서 우리는 그 소속감을 공유할 수 있습니다.
 평가해 주셔서 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4218.187s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 사실 그것이 취임 이후 이 분야에 대해 어떻게 느끼셨는지에 대한 정확한 설명이라고 생각합니다.
 또한 지난 8년 동안 저는 스스로에게 다음과 같은 질문을 해왔습니다. 공립학교란 무엇인가?
 만족스러운 답변을 드릴 수 없을 것 같습니다.
 나는 그 핵심이 단지 비디오 가게일 뿐이라는 것을 깨닫기 시작한 것 같습니다.</p>

 이제 나는 그것이 무엇인지 이해하고 그것이 많은 관심을 받고 있다는 소식을 듣고 기쁩니다.
 커뮤니티에 변화에 만족하지 않는 사람들이 있다는 것을 알고 있으며 우리가 더 잘할 수 있다고 생각합니다. 하지만 그들이 누구인지, 우리가 원하는 것이 무엇인지, 커뮤니티를 어떻게 지원하고 싶은지도 이해해야 합니다.
 그래서 저는 이런 일이 일어나게 되어 정말 기쁩니다.

 បើគ្មានការប្រកួតទេ អ្នកជាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងមិនអាចមានរបៀបវារៈផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនបានទេ។
 មិនអីទេ
 ប្រសិនបើវាមិនទាក់ទងទៅនឹងការរំពឹងទុករបស់សហគមន៍ និងការរំពឹងទុករបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តវាណាស់ សូម្បីតែនៅពេលដែលអ្នកកំណត់គោលដៅក៏ដោយ ក៏អ្នកបានគូសបន្ទាត់រវាងគោលដៅទាំងនោះ ហើយយើងនឹងបន្តធ្វើការ ព្រោះយើងមិនទាន់នៅទីនោះនៅឡើយ។
 តើពួកគេជាអ្វី?
 យើងគិតថាទាំងនេះគឺជាអាទិភាពសំខាន់សម្រាប់អ្នក ប៉ុន្តែក៏មានឥទ្ធិពលលើការសន្ទនាផែនការយុទ្ធសាស្រ្តដែលនឹងប្រព្រឹត្តទៅដែលអ្នកដឹងថាមានសារៈសំខាន់។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះការតភ្ជាប់នៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមតិផ្សេងទៀតគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងបានធ្វើ។
 មានការផ្លាស់ប្តូរដ៏ធំនៅក្នុងតំបន់ក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយឆ្នាំកន្លងមកនេះ ដោយចាប់ផ្តើមជាមួយនឹងការផ្លាស់ប្តូរកាលវិភាគ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​លទ្ធផល​មិន​ល្អ​ឥត​ខ្ចោះ​ទេ។

 ខ្ញុំជឿ
 តាមទស្សនៈនៃការចរចា ការមានលោកបណ្ឌិត Gallusi នៅតុមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ ពីព្រោះយើងបានពិភាក្សាជាច្រើនអំពីទិដ្ឋភាពនៃការបង្រៀន និងផលប៉ះពាល់នៃអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងស្នើសុំ ដែលនៅពេលនោះហាក់ដូចជារដ្ឋបាលនៅក្នុងធម្មជាតិ ប៉ុន្តែវាមិនមែនទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ វា​អនុញ្ញាត​ឱ្យ​យើង​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​មួយ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​ក្នុង​ការ​បង្រៀន។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ពិត​ជា​សំខាន់ ហើយ​មាន​មួយ។
 មានវិធីជាច្រើនដែលអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងពាក់ព័ន្ធនៅពីក្រោយឆាក និងរឿងដែលសាធារណជនមើលមិនឃើញផ្ទាល់ ប៉ុន្តែយល់ ប៉ុន្តែចុងក្រោយគឺចេញមក ហើយខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាខ្ញុំមានច្រើននៅក្នុងប្រភេទនេះដែលយើងស្ថិតនៅកណ្តាល។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថា យើងមិនបានឃើញកាលវិភាគល្អបំផុតនៅក្នុងវិទ្យាល័យ និងវគ្គសិក្សាពិបាកៗទេ ចាប់តាំងពីឆ្នាំសិក្សាថ្មីមក។
 មិនអីទេ
 ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេបានសុំឱ្យខ្ញុំប្រើ DESE ហើយឈ្នះ
 លេខាធិការអប់រំ និងអភិបាលរងបានមកទីនេះ ហើយខ្ញុំអាចមើលបាតុកម្មនេះ និងនិយាយជាមួយពួកគេអំពីរបៀបដែលយើងធ្វើនៅទីនេះ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេឃើញការធ្វើបែបនេះនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ផ្សេងទៀត។
 នេះ​គឺ​ជា​វិធី​សាស្រ្ត​គិត​យ៉ាង​ខ្លាំង​ដែល​ជួយ​កាត់​បន្ថយ​ការ​សរសេរ​កម្មវិធី និង​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម​មួយ​ចំនួន
 វាជាការគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការមើលថាតើការយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ទាំងអស់នេះទទួលបានប៉ុន្មានក្នុងឆ្នាំដំបូងរបស់យើង និងដំណើរកម្សាន្តលើកដំបូងរបស់យើង ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាស្ញប់ស្ញែងចំពោះក្រុមដែលពួកគេបានរួមគ្នា។
 ទាំងនេះកើតឡើងដោយសារតែអ្នកជារឿយៗមិនទទួលបានឥណទាននៅពេលអ្នកដាក់ពាក្យរហូតដល់ពេលក្រោយ។
 វាគ្រប់គ្រាន់ក្នុងការនិយាយ ទាំងអស់នេះគឺជាលទ្ធផលនៃការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសចាប់តាំងពីដើមអាណត្តិរបស់គាត់មានមុខតំណែងជាច្រើននៅទំនេរ។
 ពេលខ្លះអ្នកគឺជាមនុស្សតែម្នាក់គត់នៅកន្លែងខ្លះ ហើយអ្នកត្រូវដោះស្រាយជាមួយនឹងអ្វីដែលនឹងមកដល់ និងធ្វើឱ្យតំបន់មានស្ថេរភាព។
 ស្ថេរភាពទាំងអស់នេះហាក់ដូចជានៅឆ្ងាយ។
 បាទ យើងបានធ្វើ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលសន្និសីទនេះ និងរឿងល្អទាំងអស់នេះនិយាយអំពី។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​នៅ​ពី​ក្រោយ​ឆាក​អ្វី​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ការ​ដើម្បី​រក្សា​ស្ថិរភាព​តំបន់​គឺ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ
 អ្វីមួយដែលធំជាងអ្វីដែលអ្នកអាចដាក់នៅលើស្លាយ។
 នេះ​ហាក់​ដូចជា​វែងឆ្ងាយ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​បាន​ធ្វើ​វា​ដោយ​យុត្តិធម៌​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិនិត្យ​របស់​អ្នក​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំរីករាយដែលវាស្ថិតនៅក្នុងកញ្ចក់មើលក្រោយ។
 សូមអរគុណ។</p>

 나는 이것이 교육적 의사 결정을 위한 향상된 데이터베이스라고 믿습니다.
 새로운 분석 플랫폼 등을 통해 데이터를 수집할 예정이라고 하셨습니다. 지침 등을 생성하는 데 실시간으로 사용됩니다.
 당신이 이것을 어떻게 달성하고 싶은지 또는 어떻게 할 것인지에 대한 예를 들어줄 수 있다고 생각합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5057.953s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: في الواقع، هل تتحدث؟ آسف لاجي، الجو حار، أريد التأكد من أنني أسمع بشكل صحيح.
 هل تقصد Open Architect؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5065.538s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 예, 귀하가 이 데이터 중 일부가 실시간으로 사용될 것이라고 말씀하셨거나 제 메모에서 기억합니다.
 이것이 내 관심을 끌었기 때문에 예를 들어주실 수 있는지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5076.184s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 분명히.
 그러니 실시간은 필요없어
 교실에서.
 그것은 일어나고 있습니다.
 하지만 중요한 점은 포스팅이 끝날 때까지 리뷰를 기다리지 않아도 된다는 점입니다.
 우리는 한 해의 중반, 연초, 연말에 중요한 사항을 살펴볼 필요가 없습니다.
 실시간이란 교사가 대시보드, Hill for Literacy 및 개방형 아키텍처 플랫폼을 사용하여 데이터에 액세스할 수 있음을 의미합니다.
 이 정보는 자주 사용되며 일일 또는 주간 계획 및 상담의 기초가 될 수 있습니다.
 따라서 요일을 계획할 때 다양한 데이터 모델을 사용할 수 있습니다.
 그 중 일부는 교사들만이 수집한 데이터이기도 합니다.
 학생 피드백(우편으로만)은 교사가 실시간으로 제공할 수 있는 데이터를 사용할 수 있는 다양한 방법이 있음을 나타내며 이는 계획 및 교육에 영향을 미칩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5151.117s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 교사가 이 데이터를 보고 가장 많은 시간을 보내는 영역을 제안할 수 있는 교실 수준이나, 학생들이 어려움을 겪고 있고 도움이 필요한 것을 개별 학생 수준에서 볼 수 있거나, 두 가지 모두를 할 수 있는 것을 상상할 수 있습니까?
 어떻게...모든 것이 더 높아요.
 이상적인.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5170.553s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 학생 수준, 학급 수준, 학과 수준, 교실 수준, 학교 수준에서도 동일한 일이 발생합니다.
 이 모든 것은 교사가 학생의 요구 사항을 충족하기 위해 개별적으로 작업하고, 교실 또는 부서 수준의 데이터를 동료와 함께 작업하고, 학교 리더와 학장이 교사와 광범위하게 협력할 때 발생합니다.
 확실히 모든 레벨에 적합합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5203.812s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 이것은 교사와 교육자의 관점에서 보면 매우 좋은 것 같습니다.
 여러분, DIBELS가 안타깝습니다. 이 슬라이드에는 DIBELS가 많이 있습니다.
 당신은 그들이 역사적으로 그 지역의 교사들을 도왔다고 말하는 것뿐입니다.

 아, 데브스, 고마워요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5234.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 디블 그렇죠.

 예, DIBLS 시스템은 학생들의 읽기 수준과 능력을 평가하는 데 사용됩니다.
 그래서 다르게 보입니다.
 2세 K와 3~5세 K의 모습은 학생마다 다르며 독립적인 읽기 수준도 다릅니다.
 Dibbles는 표준 도구 역할을 하며 진행 상황을 추적합니다.
 그러니 참고용으로 학년 초, 중간, 연말에 각 학생에게 나눠주세요.
 이는 다양한 방식으로 추적되어 보고에 사용되는 데이터입니다.
 그러나 일부 학생들은 자신의 진행 상황을 모니터링해야 합니다.
 모든 사람이 이렇게 할 수 있는 것은 아니지만 어린 학생들은 자신의 진행 상황을 모니터링해야 합니다.
 일부 학생은 감독이 필요할 수 있습니다.
 2주마다, 4주마다.
 다른 학생들은 6~8주마다 올 수 있으므로 필요 정도에 따라 다릅니다.
 따라서 이 Dibbles는 간략한 1분 개요입니다.
 이는 교사가 이 기간 동안 진행 상황과 발전을 추적하여 실제로 목표에 집중할 수 있도록 진행 상황 추적에도 사용됩니다.
 당신의 지인.
 우리가 Continuum이라고 부르는 Hill Literacy 플랫폼의 가장 큰 장점은 모든 데이터가 이 포럼에 입력된다는 것입니다.
 교사는 데이터에 액세스할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 특정 학생을 가르치는 데 집중하는 데도 도움이 됩니다.
 교사는 학생 수준에서 이것을 가지고 있습니다.
 그런 다음 이 데이터를 사용하여 학생들의 필요에 따라 학생들을 그룹화하고 그룹 학습에 집중할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5345.573s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 이상적인.
 감사합니다
 죄송합니다. 다른 것이 있습니다.
 처음부터 모르시면 괜찮습니다만, Open Architect의 금전적 가치가 이전 시스템과 비교될 정도인지 아니면 새로운 것인지... 좋은 질문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5369.05s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 먼저 Dibbles에 대한 질문부터 시작하고 싶습니다. 저는 Dibbles가 중요하다고 생각합니다. 왜냐하면 Dibbles의 가격은 학생당 $1에 불과하기 때문입니다.
 실제로는 플랫폼에 대해서만 비용을 지불하므로 매우 비용 효율적입니다.
 오픈 아키텍트, 7명?
 아니면 20.
 주변 지역을 방문하는 데 $ 20,000.
 따라서 모든 직원, 교사, 교사 및 관리자가 이 플랫폼에 액세스할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5402.482s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 이해합니다.
 감사합니다
 이번에도 흥미롭습니다.</p>

 나는 단지 내가 그것을 얼마나 좋아하는지 말하고 싶다.
 우리에게 완전하고 상세한 설명을 주셨습니다.
 짧은 시간 안에 많은 것을 이룰 수 있다고 믿습니다.
 취임 이후 가장 고마웠던 점은 바로 팀감이다.
 나는 이것이 당신이 여기서 자세히 설명한 많은 내용을 강조한다고 생각합니다.
 간병인의 참여를 포함하여 의사소통과 협력에 대해 이야기하는 것이 정말 중요하다고 생각합니다.
 지난 달에 제가 인터뷰한 많은 학부모님들은 학생들이 학교에서 돌아왔을 때 느꼈던 설렘에 대해 공개적으로 이야기했습니다.
 생활비 때문에 부모 역할에 완전히 참여하는 것이 점점 더 어려워지고 있다는 인식(예: 활동 일정 잡기의 어려움)
 결과적으로 우리는 매일 학생들을 학교에 보내지만 원하는 만큼 활동적이지 않습니다.
 앞서 언급한 것처럼 개선과 소통의 여지는 항상 있다고 생각하며, 일반 대중과 학생들이 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 더 많이 이해하면 도움이 될 것이라고 생각합니다.
 나는 그들이 소유권이 우리가 다음 학기나 두 학기, 그리고 다음 학년도에 나아갈 때 소속감을 유지하는 것을 의미한다는 것을 이해하기를 바랍니다.
 정말 잘 해내신 것 같아요. 그래서 그것에 대해 감사드리고 싶습니다.

 할 일이 많고 장기적으로 무슨 일이 일어나는지 지켜볼 것입니다.
 나는 이 분야에서 많은 것을 배웠습니다.
 하지만 내 질문 중 하나는 피드백을 수집하는 방법입니다.
 나는 이것이 여러 번 언급되었다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 뭔가 잘 진행되고 있는지, 뭔가 잘 안 되고 있는지, 마감일이 있을 수도 있고, 컬렉터가 오픈 아키텍트나 기타 기술 개발 프로그램을 최적화하여 작동하는지, 사람들이 이를 받아들이는지, 학생이나 교사인지 확인하고 있을 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5532.189s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 이것은 매우 좋은 질문입니다.
 아, 마이크 근처에 없어요.
 이것은 매우 좋은 질문입니다.
 나는 그렇다고 말할 것이다
 만날 때, 기술을 발전시킬 때 항상 승리가 있습니다.
 우리는 실제로 이 데이터를 사용하여 다음 회의를 구성하고 개선하며 이에 대해 매우 관심이 있습니다.
 행동 방침을 변경할 때 피드백을 어떻게 존중할 수 있는지에 대해 설명합니다.
 우리는 많은 연구를 했다고 생각합니다.
 나는 이것이 데이터 수집 방법에 대한 나의 현재 생각 중 일부를 반영한다고 생각합니다.
 아시다시피 저희는 설문조사를 통해 피드백을 받지만 항상 Medford의 콘텐츠가 반영되는 것은 아닙니다.
 우리에게 이것은 지속적인 임무입니다.
 트랙 데이터의 일부 레이어가 남아 있습니다.
 그래서 누군가를 만나면
 이런 수준의 반응은 길에서 사람들을 만날 때도, 학교에 갈 때도, 컨퍼런스에 참석할 때도 일어납니다.
 핵심 리더십 팀으로서 우리가 하는 일 중 하나는 랜딩 페이지와 스프레드시트를 만드는 것입니다.
 이 데이터를 가져올 수 있도록 허용해 주세요.
 특히 Talbot 박사와 저는 어떤 일이 일어나고 있다는 소식을 듣거나 어떤 일이 일어나고 있다는 소식을 들었을 때 그것을 적어서 다시 돌아갈 수 있도록 자리를 마련했습니다.
 이는 사람들이 정보를 얻기 위해 어디로 가야 하는지 알 수 있도록 목표를 설정하기 위해 관리자가 하거나 좋아하는 것과 유사합니다.
 그러나 나는 이것이 또한 부분적으로 우리가 하는 일이라고 말할 수 있습니다.
 다음 포럼은 실제 사람들의 의견과 제안을 수집하는 또 다른 장소가 될 것이라고 생각합니다.
 설문조사가 있을 것이라는 것은 알고 있었지만 회의 중에 중요한 데이터를 많이 수집했습니다.
 위원회와 작업 팀의 참여로.
 하지만 이는 모두가 목소리를 낼 수 있도록 보장하는 방법의 일부일 뿐입니다.
 이것이 항상 해야 할 일입니다.</p>

 한마디로 캡틴
 이번이 첫 만남인데 모두가 하고 있는 모든 일, 특히 경영진에 대한 소식을 듣고 너무 기뻤습니다.
 저는 세 가지에 관심이 있습니다. 많은 제도적 변화와 혁신이 진행되고 있습니다.
 힘든 작업이고 시간도 많이 걸리며 매우 아름다워 보입니다.
 이는 귀하가 우리와 공유하고 싶은 작업에 명확하게 반영됩니다.
 둘째, 커리큘럼 개발 개념을 지원하면 교사는 커리큘럼을 만드는 데 시간을 할애할 수 있고 커리큘럼을 전달하는 방법에 집중하고 이러한 관계를 구축하려고 노력할 수 있습니다.
 이것이 실제 역률입니다.
 다시 한 번 귀하와 귀하의 팀에게 진심으로 축하의 말씀을 전하고 싶습니다.
 놀라운.
 마지막으로, 나의 가장 큰 관심사는 공립학교입니다.
 이것은 공개 자료입니다.
 저는 이 곳의 이사이자 관리자로서 세대 간 형평성 사이의 균형을 찾아야 한다고 믿습니다.
 이를 통해 현재 사용자를 지원하고 향후 사용자(10년, 20년, 30년)를 위해 해당 자산을 보존할 수 있습니다.
 따라서 저는 귀하의 팀이 공립학교의 미래에 대한 논의에 어떤 결과를 가져올지 매우 기대됩니다.
 하지만 지도해주셔서 정말 감사드립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5793.391s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 감사합니다
 저는 또한 이러한 노력에 귀하와 협력하게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다.
 정말 좋은 아이디어가 있으신 것 같습니다.

 이 주제를 마치기 전에 관리자 평가 프로세스의 다음 단계를 커뮤니티에 설명하고 싶습니다.
 그래서 나는 Orapada 사람들이 당신에게 그것을 말하게 할 것입니다.
 하지만 내 생각엔 그게 내 문제인 것 같아.
 다시 한 번 말씀드리지만, MSBA 문제에 대한 유사한 계획을 개발하기 위해 26차 회의에서 이 문제를 함께 더 깊이 고려하고 검토해 볼까요?
 이 위원회의 도움이 필요하십니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5839.358s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 이것은 매우 좋은 질문입니다.

 이 보고서는 우리 각자가 위에서 평가한 후 자신의 생각과 포부를 준비하여 사회에 보낼 수 있도록 내일 아침에 출판될 것입니다.
 그런 다음 이 데이터를 가져와 짧은 메시지로 편집하겠습니다.
 나는 내가 읽으려는 내용이 내 모든 생각과 관점의 조합이라는 점을 청중에게 분명히 밝히고 싶습니다.
 이건 지난 회의에서 멤버들끼리 결정하기 때문에 멤버들이 꼭 말할 필요가 있다고 느끼지 않는 한 멤버 개개인이 결정하지는 않지만, 우리가 따르는 기준이나 모델이 아닌 경우가 많아 26일쯤 준비가 될 예정이다.

 하지만 이건, 내 말은, 너도 알잖아
 신문이 다 떨어지자 사람들은 갈 곳이 없었습니다.
 예를 들어, Facebook에 가면 Medford Politics에는 2,000명의 회원이 있는데, 대부분이 Medford에 살고 있을 것입니다.
 그들은 거기에 있었을 때 메드퍼드와 접촉하고 있었고 메드퍼드에서 온 무언가와 접촉하고 있었다고 확신할 수 있었습니다.
 도전이라고 생각하고, 도시 전체가 문을 두드리거나 물건을 던지는 것 외에는 소통할 수 있는 방법이 없다고 생각합니다.
 분명히 둘 다 매우 비쌉니다.
 내 생각에 우리는 특히 새로운 고등학교에 관해 이야기할 때 슬픈 상태에 있다고 생각합니다.
 아시다시피, 새 고등학교에 대해 이야기할 때 신문에 사설을 쓸 수는 없고 유권자의 과반수를 얻을 것이라고 생각합니다.
 이것이 바로 우리 시대의 진정한 도전입니다.

 វាស្រស់ស្អាតណាស់។
 សូមអរគុណ
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​ឆ្លៀត​ពេល​ខ្លះ​ដើម្បី​និយាយ​អំពី​ប្រតិទិន​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ស្នើ​នៅ​ទី​នេះ​គឺ​ជម្រើស​នេះ​សម្រាប់​ប្រតិទិន​សាលា​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 នេះគឺជារឿងមួយចំនួនដែលត្រូវចងចាំនៅពេលអ្នកគ្រោងសម្រាប់ឆ្នាំសិក្សា 2026-27៖ ទិវាពលកម្មគឺហួសពេលយូរហើយ។
 ដូចដែលអ្នកអាចឃើញនៅទីនេះ ទិវាពលកម្មគឺថ្ងៃទី 7 ខែកញ្ញាដែលមានន័យថាយោងទៅតាមកិច្ចសន្យា។
 ត្រឡប់ទៅសាលារៀនវិញកាលពីសប្តាហ៍មុន។
 តាមពិតនេះគឺជាសប្តាហ៍ដំបូងនៃខែកញ្ញាឆ្នាំក្រោយ។
 ជា​ធម្មតា​ក្នុង​អំឡុង​ឆ្នាំ សប្តាហ៍​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​គឺ​ជា​សប្តាហ៍​ចុង​ក្រោយ​នៃ​ខែ​សីហា។
 នៅឆ្នាំក្រោយវានឹងជាសប្តាហ៍ដំបូងនៃខែកញ្ញា។
 លើសពីនេះ ថ្ងៃបោះឆ្នោតបឋមគឺថ្ងៃអង្គារ ទី០១ ខែកញ្ញា។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ផ្តល់​ជូន​នៅ​ទី​នេះ គឺ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​ការ​ណែនាំ​ឱ្យ​អនុវត្ត​តាម​រចនា​សម្ព័ន្ធ​ដូច​គ្នា​នឹង​ឆ្នាំ​នេះ ការ​ត្រឡប់​គ្រូ​មក​ថ្ងៃ​អភិវឌ្ឍ​វិជ្ជាជីវៈ បើក​សាលា​នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ច័ន្ទ ទី ៣១ ខែ​សីហា និង​ថ្ងៃ​ទី ១ ខែ​កញ្ញា និង​ស្វាគមន៍​សិស្ស​ថ្នាក់​ទី ១-១២ នៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ទី ២ ខែ​កញ្ញា។
 នេះជាការពិត,
 ថ្ងៃទី 23 ខែមិថុនាគឺជាថ្ងៃចុងក្រោយនៃសាលារៀនសម្រាប់ថ្ងៃដែលគ្មានព្រិល។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើមានថ្ងៃធ្លាក់ព្រិល យើងត្រូវបន្ថែមវាបន្ទាប់ពីថ្ងៃទី 23 ខែមិថុនា។
 ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សា ខ្ញុំក៏ចង់មានតម្លាភាពផងដែរ។
 នៅពេលដែលប្រតិទិនត្រូវបានដាក់ឱ្យដំណើរការកាលពីឆ្នាំមុន ដោយសារថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកមួយចំនួន។
 មានមតិមួយដែលថាថ្ងៃបុណ្យធំៗត្រូវបានប្រារព្ធឡើងសម្រាប់ហេតុផលសាសនា ហើយខ្ញុំស្អប់ក្នុងការនិយាយវាតិចបំផុត ប៉ុន្តែសម្រាប់ការខ្វះពាក្យល្អជាងនេះ ពួកគេមិនមែនជាថ្ងៃបុណ្យសំខាន់ដែលសមនឹងការប្រារព្ធនោះទេ។
 យើង​នឹង​ចាត់​វិធានការ​ដូច​គ្នា​នៅ​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ចង្អុល​បង្ហាញ​ថា ជា​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ រហូត​មក​ដល់​ឆ្នាំ​នេះ សាលា​សាធារណៈ Medford នៅ​តែ​មាន Good Friday។
 នេះជាឆ្នាំដំបូង។
 នេះជាថ្ងៃសិក្សា មិនមែនជាថ្ងៃសម្រាកទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ប្រតិទិនដែលបានស្នើឡើងនៅឆ្នាំក្រោយក៏រួមបញ្ចូលថ្ងៃសុក្រល្អជាថ្ងៃសិក្សាផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមជូនពរអ្នកឱ្យល្អបំផុត ប៉ុន្តែយើងក៏មិននៅទីនេះដែរ។
 ដូចអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានជួបប្រទះនៅថ្ងៃនោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា យើង​មិន​ត្រូវ​បាន​រារាំង​ដោយ​បញ្ហា​ផ្ទាល់​ខ្លួន​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឱ្យមានតម្លាភាពទាំងស្រុងអំពីការពិតដែលថាប្រតិទិននេះត្រូវបានស្នើឡើង ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជាត្រូវមានការពិភាក្សាបន្ថែមទៀតនៅពេលណាមួយនៅពេលដែលយើងមើលឃើញថាមានអ្វីកើតឡើងនៅកាលបរិច្ឆេទនៅឆ្នាំនេះ។
 លើសពីនេះទៀត ផ្នែកតែមួយគត់គឺថា DESI មានបទប្បញ្ញត្តិទាក់ទងនឹងពេលវេលានៃការបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សា និងគម្លាតរវាងការបញ្ចប់ថ្នាក់វិទ្យាល័យ និងថ្ងៃចុងក្រោយនៃការចូលរៀននៅក្នុងស្រុក។
 ហើយចំនួនមនុស្សមិនអាចលើសពី 12 នាក់។
 នោះមានន័យថាថ្នាក់ឆ្នាំក្រោយនៃឆ្នាំ 2027 អាចបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅព្រឹកថ្ងៃសុក្រទី 4 ខែមិថុនា។
 ដូច្នេះ យោងតាមបទប្បញ្ញត្តិរបស់ DESI យើងត្រូវផ្លាស់ទីវាពីថ្ងៃពុធដល់ថ្ងៃសុក្រ។
 ក្រៅ​ពី​នោះ យើង​ពិត​ជា​ធ្វើ​តាម​រចនាសម្ព័ន្ធ​ដូច​ឆ្នាំ​នេះ​ដែរ។
 នេះ​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​ពិចារណា​ក្នុង​ការងារ​រួម​ជាមួយ​សហជីព​បង្រៀន។
 ថ្ងៃនេះខ្ញុំបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយប្រធានសហជីពលោក Anthony Gillen ។
 ហើយផែនការនេះគឺស្របទាំងស្រុងជាមួយនឹងកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងរួម ដូច្នេះពិតណាស់ពួកគេគាំទ្រវា។</p>

 사실 2026년 날짜를 보고 싶다고 하셔서 아, 그런데 2027년과 같은 날짜가 필요하지만 9월 1일 이후 날짜에는 2026년이 필요하다고 말씀하셨기 때문에 실제로는 쉽지 않습니다.
 때로는 피곤하고 혼란스럽습니다.
 나는 우리의 정책과 제안된 달력을 수락하고 그것을 본 후 GPT Chat에 올해가 언제인지 물었습니다.
 나는 심지어 몇 가지 실수를 저질렀고 모든 것이 매우 나쁘다는 메시지를 거의 보냈습니다.
 하지만 나는 내가 틀렸다는 것을 알았기 때문에 그렇게 하지 않았습니다.
 그러므로 나는 이것이 사실임을 확인합니다.
 그리고 솔직하게 말해서 올해 우리는 매우 운이 좋았습니다. 공휴일, 종교적 공휴일이 너무 많아서 토요일이나 솔직히 토요일과 일요일에는 학교가 없기 때문입니다.
 그래서 학교의 관점에서 볼 때 우리는 매우 운이 좋았습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6590.903s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Thank you.
 I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.
 So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.
 So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.
 We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.
 But they already were on board and working.
 And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can
 And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?
 So what happens today?
 How does it happen?
 Where is the ledge?
 Where is the playing field?
 How does traffic flow?
 Where are the challenges?
 And all of that good stuff.
 So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to
 And I think that's a really good question.
 I think that's a really good question.
 And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.
 So they've been doing all of that work.
 They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.
 So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.
 They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.
 There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.
 All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.
 At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.
 That work has been really interesting to watch.
 So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.
 So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.
 And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.
 And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.
 What do you do?
 How do you do it?
 Where do you do it?
 All of that good stuff.
 So all of that happened.
 That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.
 Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.
 So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?
 So it's very educationally focused.
 It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having
 grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.
 So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.
 It started with a shadow day and
 Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.
 Arrival, lunch, passing periods.
 like all of it.
 Right.
 So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.
 He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.
 I think they saw four schools in a day.
 Is that right.
 To help our team understand what's possible.
 Right.
 Because many people
 have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.
 So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.
 So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.
 Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,
 and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.
 And I got to be part of that two-day session.
 And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.
 And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.
 And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.
 So he was super skillful and artful.
 just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.
 So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.
 So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like
 The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.
 what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?
 And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.
 And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.
 But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate
 What are we going to do in the building?
 And how are we going to do it?
 And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.
 And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.
 Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?
 And is it an open space or a closed space?
 That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is
 a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.
 Like why do you need a new space, right?
 So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.
 And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.
 And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.
 And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.
 And then we have this set of sessions.
 And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?
 And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.
 And
 She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.
 And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.
 And we're like, fair, right?
 Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.
 But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.
 And we were like, why?
 Why wouldn't you do it there?
 And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.
 And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,
 maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.
 Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?
 I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?
 Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?
 And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,
 like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say
 do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?
 And the answer is like, absolutely not.
 Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.
 So out of all of that will come an educational plan.
 And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.
 So we'll be introducing it then.
 So SMMA will be here with us.
 We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.
 But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,
 is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.
 Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.
 And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.
 So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.
 Preliminary design plan.
 And that PDP includes the educational plan.
 That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.
 And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space
 concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.
 That work is for the building committee to do.
 So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.
 But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.
 So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.
 And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from
 Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.
 The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.
 Where will the building go and what will it look like?
 Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?
 So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.
 So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.
 so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?
 So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.
 And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.
 lots of chances for community input in those sessions.
 So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.
 And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.
 So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.
 Translation services will be available.
 We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.
 They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks
 Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.
 And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.
 We'll collect a lot of questions.
 We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.
 And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.
 And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.
 And there'll be a place for public input.
 And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.
 We're working on plans for that.
 Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.
 So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.
 And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?
 Like the building could be here, it could be there.
 That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.
 So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?
 How many classrooms is it?
 that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,
 And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.
 That's why the ed plan is so important.
 So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.
 And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.
 And that's false.
 It's almost completely false.
 I think there's one program where that is true.
 And it's like a marginal change.
 In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.
 So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.
 It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan
 is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?
 One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.
 They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.
 And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.
 What's the other one?
 Fitness center.
 So, and it's not like marginally bigger.
 What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.
 So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.
 So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think
 part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.
 But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.
 It's been a lot of really not glorious,
 And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not
 the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.
 They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.
 So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.
 But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.
 So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.
 So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.
 Let's see, where'd it go?
 Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.
 I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.
 And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.
 One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.
 And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.
 And to create a higher quality,
 video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.
 None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.
 So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.
 On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.
 This is where we're going to start to see concepts.
 This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.
 And then we will
 Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.
 we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.
 The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.
 We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.
 Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.
 On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.
 On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.
 So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.
 All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.
 There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.
 And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.
 That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.
 By June we will have one.
 So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish
 How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?
 So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.
 But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.
 Tell us what you think about them.
 So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.
 And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.
 where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.
 So that's the next three months of this project.
 So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?
 No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.
 and cost.
 So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.
 We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized
 doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.
 There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.
 There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.
 But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.
 So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.
 But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8120.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 렌필드 의원.
 감사합니다
 이것은 흥미롭습니다.
 네, 드디어요.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 나는 이것에 대해 매우 행복합니다.
 그래서 첫 번째 질문은 '이 세션에서 전략 계획 회의 중에 사용할 수 있는 내용이 있습니까?'입니다.
 왜냐하면 멋져 보이기 때문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8136.725s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 훌륭한 경험.
 방에 있던 몇몇 사람들은 모든 고등학교 교사들을 위해 이 일을 해야 한다고 말한 것 같습니다.
 그래서 일어날 수 있는 일에 대해 많은 에너지가 있습니다.
 내 생각엔 Mike의 진술 중 하나가
 그는 학교에서 무언가를 만들고 사용하지 않는다는 말을 들었을 때 조직의 책임자가 누구인지 물었습니다.
 당신은 항상 이것을 듣습니다.
 그 사람은 그 일 때문에 그런 일이 일어났다고 하더군요
 사람들은 자신의 희망, 꿈, 열망을 기록합니다.
 “이런 것들이 있으면 정말 좋을 것 같아요.”라고 그들은 말했습니다.
 그런 다음 모두가 자신의 희망, 꿈, 열망 목록을 닫고 공사가 완료될 때까지 기다립니다.
 이 건물이 그들을 변화시키길 바랍니다.
 이 건물은 그렇게 하지 않을 거예요.
 사람들에게 정말 변화가 필요하기 때문에 변화가 일어나야 합니다. 그렇죠?
 그래서 우리는 조금 이야기를 나눴어요
 처음 교육 계획을 세울 때 실제로 함께 성장하기 위해서는 어떤 전문성 개발 기회와 회의가 제공되어야 합니까?
 이 건물을 열기 전에 무엇을 할 수 있나요?
 우리는 언제 이것을 할 수 있나요?
 어떤 유형의 도움이 필요합니까?
 이는 교육기획단이 수행하는 또 다른 업무이다.
 물론 저는 “기꺼이 조언을 드리고 싶습니다”라고 말했습니다.
 직접 수행하는 방법을 기꺼이 알려 드리겠습니다.
 그렇게 하는 데 도움을 드리게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다.
 하지만 네, 저는 그것이 사실이라고 생각합니다. 왜냐하면 그는 사람들이 우리에게 말하려고 하는 것으로 생각하도록 오해하는 일을 훌륭하게 해냈기 때문입니다.
 중요하고 고도로 숙련된 작업이므로 다음 단계를 신중하게 생각하는 것이 중요하다고 생각합니다.
 비록 청중에 대한 통제력이 덜할지라도 전략 계획 수업에서 동일한 기술을 많이 사용할 것이라고 생각합니다. 따라서 이에 대해 살펴보겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8273.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 매우 치유됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8275.047s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 응, 응.
 네, 잘 조직된 청중이 있으면 실제로 주도권을 잡을 수 있다고 생각합니다. 그리고 우리는 또한 2시간짜리 전략 기획 세션을 가지려고 노력합니다.
 이틀 남았습니다.
 따라서 우리가 하는 일은 약간 달라져야 하지만 동일한 아이디어 중 상당수가 확실히 적용될 것입니다.
 네, 사람들이 이 방법을 공유할 수 있었으면 좋겠어요. 네, 저희가 말씀드릴 수 있는 한 가지는 그것을 어떻게 극복할 것인지에 관한 것입니다. 왜냐하면 제 생각엔 이미 그런 일이 벌어지고 있기 때문입니다.
 뭔가 멋진 일이 일어났고 언젠가 그것에 대해 이야기할 수 있을 거라고 생각했어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8311.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 네, 제 말은, 제 생각에는 우리 아이들이 그것을 좋아하지 않을 것 같지만 오늘 기사를 받았습니다. 하지만 학교 안은 밖보다 더 추웠고, 어느 날 나는 건축가에게 프랑스어로 머리 땋는 법을 가르쳤습니다.
 그래서 이 학생이 관심을 갖고 있는 모습이 보기 좋습니다.
 그래서 지금 제가 갖고 있는 다른 질문은 대부분 지역 사회 봉사 활동에 관한 것 같아요.
 Simon이 학교 커뮤니티 외부의 사람들에게 이 메시지를 전하게 되어 기쁩니다.
 우리는 이를 위한 많은 전략을 가지고 있으며 저는 그렇게 하고 싶습니다.
 나는 이 정보를 포럼, 토론 포럼 또는 학교 이메일을 통해 게시하고 싶습니다.
 이것이 반드시 메드포드 커뮤니티 전체에 적용되는 것은 아니라는 것을 알지만 청중 속에 있는 모든 초등학교 교장들을 보고 있는 것 같은 느낌이 듭니다. 이들은 이 건물과 고등학교에 살고 있는 학생들입니다.
 그래서 수요일에 그 발표를 할 수 있으면 좋겠지만, 그 당시 뉴잉글랜드 날씨 등에 따라 옵트아웃 공지 같은 것을 할 수 있을지 궁금합니다. 하지만 구독 방법과 뉴스레터가 있는지, 프로그램에 대한 정보를 저장하는 방법과 무언가를 찾을 수 있다면 이미 찾을 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8399.811s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 네, 거기에서도 뭔가 준비 중이에요.
 알림을 보내드리겠습니다.
 나는 시청으로 Steve에게 전화하여 회의를 알릴 것입니다.
 이상적인.
 지역 사회 봉사 활동 대표자는 이 회의의 번역 서비스가 필요한 지역 사회에 알릴 것입니다.
 중요한 날짜에 대해 이야기하는 동안 오늘 커뮤니티와 논의하고 있는 또 다른 사항은 사람들에게 예정된 이벤트의 정확한 목록을 제공하는 방법입니다.
 그래서 일단 모든 것을 하나로 모으면 전단지와 배낭을 포함하여 많은 것을 만들 수 있습니다.
 따라서 회의에 대한 의사소통은 두 가지 다른 방식으로 이루어집니다.
 알림을 보내드린 후 다음과 같이 말씀드리겠습니다.
 초등학생을 위한 파티인 Trail of Breadcrumbs와 같은 광고도 이 모든 채널을 통해 광고될 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8457.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 학교에서 하는 일이 우리 가족 중 일부와 연결될 수 있다고 생각하기 때문입니다.
 IMHO 그들은 금지된 주간 일기를 따르지 않을 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8466.62s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 우리가 이야기할 또 다른 주제는 위원회 문제에 대한 명확한 정보를 얻고 싶어하는 커뮤니티 구성원이 그렇게 할 수 있도록 학교 커뮤니티의 더 넓은 범위와 소통하는 데 사용할 수 있는 이메일 뉴스레터를 만드는 방법입니다.
 그래서 우리에게는 관계 지향적인 것들이 많이 있습니다.
 우리는 더 폭넓은 학습자 기반을 구축하기 위해 앞으로 나아갈 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8496.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 이상적인.
 내 마지막 질문이 이것과 관련이 있는 것 같아요.
 저는 여러분이 시작할 때 커뮤니케이션 및 커뮤니티 참여 소위원회가 있었고 우리는 그것이 활발하고 강력하게 유지되기를 원한다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 이 몸이 뭔가를 알고 있다면.
 절반의 사람들은 형편이 나아졌고, 이 위원회실에는 더 많은 사람들이 있습니다.
 그는 Somerville의 여러 건축 위원회에서 활동했으며 해당 시설의 프로젝트 관리자입니다.
 여기에서 건축을 하지 않는 사람은 나뿐인 것 같아요.
 그러나 우리는 이 정보를 전파하는 위원회를 지원하기 위해 최선을 다할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8530.081s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 우리의 모든 업무가 기존 조건에 초점을 맞추고 있기 때문에 이 소위원회는 오랫동안 회의를 갖지 않았습니다.
 하지만 이 그룹이 함께 모일 기회가 있다고 생각하고 월간 뉴스레터나 건축 위원회 내에서 작성할 수 있는 것 등 출판할 수 있는 일을 하는 것에 대해 팀원들과 이야기하겠습니다.
 그래서 우리는 이것에 대해 이야기하겠습니다.</p>

 បន្ថែមពីលើអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ ខ្ញុំភ្លេចថាយើងមានគណៈកម្មការប្រឹក្សាចំនួនបួន។
 មនុស្សប្រហែល 70 នាក់នៅក្នុងគណៈកម្មាធិការចំនួន 4 កំពុងពិភាក្សាថាតើសមាជិកនៃសហគមន៍ណានឹងចូលរួមជាមួយយើង ហើយទទួលយកតួនាទីជាក់លាក់។

 ខ្ញុំបានព្យាយាមចុះទៅថ្នាក់ចុងក្រោយរបស់ខ្ញុំមុនប៉ុន្មាននាទី ព្រោះខ្ញុំត្រូវតាមឡានក្រុង ហើយឡានក្រុងនៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃអាគារ ហើយប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមិនបានទៅនោះ ខ្ញុំមិនអាចអង្គុយ ឬឡើងបានទេព្រោះវាពេញហើយមែនទេ?
 មនុស្ស​និយាយ​ថា​តាម​ពិត​វា​ដូច​គ្នា គ្រប់​គ្នា​មក​ពី​ច្រក​ចេញ​តែ​មួយ​មែន​ទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ បើ​អ្នក​ត្រូវ​ឡាន​បុក បើ​អ្នក​ត្រូវ​ឡាន​ក្រុង​បុក បើ​អ្នក​ដើរ​ទៅ​ផ្ទះ អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា​នឹង​ចេញ​ដូច​គ្នា។
 ឆ្កួតមែនទេ?
 បន្ទាប់មកពួកគេនិយាយថា៖ តើឡានក្រុងអាចទៅកន្លែងផ្សេងបានទេ?
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលសិស្សសួរ។
 តើយើងអាចកក់ឡានក្រុងនៅកន្លែងផ្សេងបានទេ?
 ចម្លើយសម្រាប់ទ្រព្យសកម្មបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់យើងគឺទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​នៅ​អគារ​ថ្មី យើង​គិត​ថា តើ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​សាលា​នេះ​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា?
 វាហាក់ដូចជាពួកគេបានដើរនៅទីនេះ។
 ដីនៅទីនេះពិតជាចោតណាស់មែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ បើ​អ្នក​ទៅ​ទីនោះ​ដោយ​ជិះ​កង់ វា​ជា​ផ្នែក​ភ្នំ​ដ៏​ចោត។
 ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកជិះកង់ទេ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនអាចធ្វើបានទេ។
 អញ្ចឹងតើយើងអាចបន្លាចបានប៉ុន្មាននាក់?
 តើ​មាន​ប្រតិកម្ម​ចំពោះ​រឿង​នោះ​ទេ​ព្រោះ​មាន​ការ​ប្រកួត​ខុស​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង?
 ហើយតើយើងអាចធានាថាយើងមិនធ្លាក់ចូលទៅក្នុងដែនកំណត់ដូចគ្នា សំខាន់អ្វីដែលកំពុងកើតឡើងសព្វថ្ងៃនេះ?
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗទាំងអស់នេះកំពុងត្រូវបានពិភាក្សា ហើយមានសំណួរមួយចំនួនកំពុងត្រូវបានលើកឡើង ដូចជាប្រហែលជាយើងត្រូវនិយាយជាមួយ MBTA អំពីកាលវិភាគរថយន្តក្រុង និងថាតើមានការផ្លាស់ប្តូរណាមួយដែលអាចត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងដើម្បីបង្កើតការដឹកជញ្ជូនកាន់តែប្រសើរឡើង។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ នៅពេលអ្នកចាប់ផ្តើមនិយាយអំពីរឿងទាំងនេះ សិស្សនិយាយត្រូវ នៅពេលដែលពួកគេនិយាយថា កុំយឺតពេលសម្រាប់ឡានក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំព្យាយាម សិស្សម្នាក់បានប្រាប់ខ្ញុំថា ខ្ញុំនឹងព្យាយាមស្នាក់នៅជំនួសការស្នាក់នៅក្រោយសាលា ព្រោះប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំស្នាក់នៅក្រោយសាលា ខ្ញុំនឹងត្រូវដើរទៅផ្ទះ 2 ម៉ាយ។
 ខ្ញុំត្រូវការមួយម៉ោង។
 ពេល​នោះ​ព្រោះ​គ្មាន​ឡាន​ក្រុង​មក​យឺត។
 ដូច្នេះនៅក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះ រឿងរ៉ាវដែលមិនចាំបាច់ជាច្រើនត្រូវបានលើកឡើង ដូចជាការពិតដែលថាឡានក្រុងយឺត ដែលមិនពាក់ព័ន្ធថាតើអគារចាស់ឬថ្មី ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃបញ្ហាទូទៅដែលយើងត្រូវដោះស្រាយ។
 ដូច្នេះ បាទ មាន​ការ​ពិភាក្សា​ជា​ច្រើន​អំពី​ការ​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​រំភើប​ចិត្ត​ដែល​បាន​ឃើញ​ថា​តើ​វា​ដំណើរការ​យ៉ាង​ណា។
 រាល់ពេលដែលខ្ញុំទៅដល់ជ្រុងខាងក្រោយនៃសក់កោងនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថា៖
 តើអ្នកណាបានធ្វើនេះ?
 ម៉េច​ក៏​តឹង​ម្ល៉េះ?
 ខ្ញុំស្ទើរតែមិនអាចរើឡានយក្សរបស់ខ្ញុំបាន ទុកឡានពីរ។
 នោះហើយជាបញ្ហា។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើអ្នកគិតថាចង់…
 គាត់ធ្វើនេះ គាត់ធ្វើនោះ។</p>
