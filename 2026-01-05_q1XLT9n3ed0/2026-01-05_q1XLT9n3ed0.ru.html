 Good evening.
 So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.
 This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.
 always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.
 My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.
 None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.
 A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.
 This work is very demanding and it is very complex.
 and it keeps you on your toes.
 And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.
 And it is work that you take home with you.
 Yet it is carried out.
 in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.
 I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.
 Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.
 I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.
 Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.
 I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.
 The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.
 Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.
 I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.
 On the next slide, please.
 What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.
 So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.
 The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 During that time, we began to work
 a lot on our instructional excellence.
 We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.
 That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.
 You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.
 creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.
 It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.
 As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.
 This spoke about the work that I had done really working on
 the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.
 All of that to bring with me to this position.
 If we could please go to the next slide.
 This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.
 So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.
 I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence
 through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.
 I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.
 So to begin, our core values
 were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.
 They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.
 These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.
 So there is collaborative effort.
 and input put into the core values.
 Next slide, please.
 Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.
 We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.
 And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.
 So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.
 Who are we?
 How do we lead?
 What we expect?
 And how do we communicate?
 Next slide, please.
 So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.
 When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,
 a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.
 Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.
 uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.
 My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.
 That was the work that really began.
 It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.
 When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.
 Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.
 This slide talks about that.
 I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.
 It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.
 and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.
 I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.
 It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.
 This is something that is
 still growing.
 This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.
 It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.
 We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.
 They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.
 We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.
 We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.
 I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.
 This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful
 negotiations with the teachers.
 And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.
 And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.
 And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.
 And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,
 That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.
 And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.
 And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.
 This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.
 It also brought us recognition and a highlight
 from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.
 And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,
 on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.
 Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.
 Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.
 And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.
 So I do think it's important to note we've had a big
 reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
 My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.
 They're bringing with them years of
 experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.
 With that, I was very intentional.
 I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.
 and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.
 So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in
 her permanent position.
 We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.
 That's really helped to stabilize the district.
 It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.
 But they also started mid to late August.
 So we are still in the stages of building
 what we know we need to do.
 A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.
 The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.
 So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.
 But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.
 And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,
 is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.
 I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.
 Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Ruseau in all of the bargaining units.
 There was a significant amount of work done last year.
 We're still going with some other units.
 Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.
 So, strengthening operational foundations.
 What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.
 For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.
 Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.
 On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.
 Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.
 So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.
 in the short time he's been here so far.
 So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.
 This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.
 This has been part of ongoing conversations.
 Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.
 Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.
 That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.
 The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.
 Heating and roof leaks.
 par for the course in the past year.
 There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.
 We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.
 Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.
 A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.
 Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.
 To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered
 speedily through Amazon.
 And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.
 But you just don't know what's going to happen.
 And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.
 The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.
 Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.
 Strengthening safety.
 So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.
 Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.
 What that has looked like is an update.
 and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.
 This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.
 to mostly fruition.
 We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their
 ability to come in and out of work.
 So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.
 School-based and district-level safety committees.
 So those have begun.
 Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.
 And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.
 And I think he had a meeting today.
 This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.
 It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.
 And then lastly for operations would be community schools.
 This is an ongoing.
 area of focus and review.
 So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.
 That's mostly the rental of our buildings.
 It also sees our summer programming summer fun.
 but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.
 So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.
 Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating
 a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.
 We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start
 We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.
 That is an area where it wasn't
 completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.
 I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.
 And for them, some of this came as a surprise.
 So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.
 So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.
 Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.
 Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.
 That through line is our shared sense of belonging.
 It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are
 mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.
 So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that
 may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.
 So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so
 critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.
 And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.
 It was used for instruction.
 And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.
 more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.
 It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support
 is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.
 At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what
 individuals need.
 That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.
 And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging
 CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.
 And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day
 Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.
 dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.
 So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.
 Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.
 And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.
 High quality instructional materials
 make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.
 Next slide.
 Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.
 This is work that
 Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.
 We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.
 We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.
 We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students
 have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.
 We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.
 It's that transfer.
 Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.
 And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.
 The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.
 and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.
 Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.
 So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.
 She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.
 She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders
 and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.
 That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.
 They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.
 This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.
 Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.
 But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.
 This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.
 And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,
 is progress monitoring their students.
 Everyone has a caseload.
 We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.
 And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.
 Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.
 I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data
 In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.
 Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.
 One of this has been some of my favorite.
 I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year
 twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.
 And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,
 means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.
 with teachers in buildings.
 And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 She's had several meetings with them.
 OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.
 This is
 a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.
 So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.
 On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.
 MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.
 We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.
 And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.
 So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.
 We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment
 Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.
 And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.
 But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor
 is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.
 And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the
 caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.
 The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.
 Communication and partnership.
 In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.
 I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.
 It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.
 With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.
 And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.
 expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.
 We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.
 Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.
 Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that
 you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.
 This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 Administrators.
 Yes, yes.
 School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.
 When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.
 We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.
 And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.
 The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.
 I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.
 I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.
 We have some upcoming forums this month.
 But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,
 the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.
 So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.
 And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.
 We are very mindful though of our search committees.
 So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.
 So that is something that we have committed to
 before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.
 And there's the task force committee.
 So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.
 As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.
 who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.
 I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.
 I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.
 It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.
 So it's important that we hear from
 from all voices.
 An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.
 And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.
 And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.
 MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.
 And then just like one example of a district-based one is
 The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.
 I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.
 Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.
 I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.
 But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.
 But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.
 So that is ongoing work for myself.
 But I have really
 committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.
 I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.
 Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,
 but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.
 It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.
 And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 I just want to make sure that I am
 working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.
 And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.
 Next slide, please.
 So with all this said, planning for the future.
 So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.
 With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.
 They are goals that we want to maintain.
 It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.
 And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.
 So first, our continuing priorities.
 These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.
 The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.
 that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.
 So strengthening those supports for students
 so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.
 And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.
 Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.
 So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.
 And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.
 Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.
 also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.
 So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.
 I think that's an important thing to note.
 So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.
 And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.
 So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.
 And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.
 And I think
 each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.
 And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.
 I did highlight this in my
 report of interim findings.
 That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.
 So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.
 Enhancing communication and community trust.
 So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures
 making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.
 All of that is continuous work.
 and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.
 We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I
 it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.
 So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing
 And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.
 How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.
 That's work that will be continuing.
 Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.
 and how they're working with them.
 That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.
 And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.
 And our CBA before,
 did not have any layers of educator leadership.
 And now it does.
 And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.
 And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.
 That is work that is ongoing for us.
 Now moving to work that our new goals.
 And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.
 So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.
 This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.
 But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.
 One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.
 I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.
 This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction
 available effectively and meaningfully for students.
 That is work that is critical.
 the implementation of open architects.
 So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.
 And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.
 Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.
 So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.
 Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff
 at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.
 And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.
 And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.
 Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.
 This is a true goal here.
 Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.
 Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.
 I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.
 We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.
 And that is wonderful.
 And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.
 There might be one at the elementary.
 But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.
 Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.
 The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.
 She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think
 her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.
 But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.
 And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been
 Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.
 And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.
 Once we have a process, we find a way to
 fine tune and make it better.
 Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.
 I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision
 and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.
 Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.
 It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.
 And it's through the MSBA forum.
 And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.
 We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're
 getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.
 And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.
 So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.
 It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.
 And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.
 And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

 Спасибо, Доктор. Идеальная и полная презентация.
 У вас все еще есть вопросы о своем теле?
 Сенатор Руссо?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4045.305s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Спасибо
 Это очень много.
 Но сначала я хочу сказать, что я очень взволнован и звук сегодня очень сильный.
 Мне нравится, что можно одновременно ходить и жевать жвачку.
 Мне не удалось найти хорошую метафору, которая звучала бы непохоже на американцев, но всем было понятно.
 Но приятно видеть, как много вещей вы освещаете.
 Честно говоря, похоже, что ты все это скрыл.
 Бывают моменты, когда я думаю: «О, мы делаем то же самое, верно?»
 Итак, как вы знаете, общение.
 Сейчас мы находимся в лучшем положении, чем когда начинали восемь лет назад, и я воодушевлен достигнутым прогрессом.
 Вы говорите, что это правильно, но вы не можете этого сделать.
 Я не знаю, связано ли это с тем, что изменилась аудитория, или требуется много времени, чтобы разработать стабильно работающую систему.
 Но сегодня моя дочь опоздала в школу, и я хочу прочитать два предложения в полученном нами электронном письме.
 Я понимаю, что мы хотим сделать все возможное, чтобы помочь вам и вашим ученикам уменьшить проблемы с вовлеченностью.
 Мы беспокоимся об опозданиях учащихся, потому что опоздания могут привести к тому, что учащиеся упустят важные возможности преподавания и обучения в школе.
 Я не знаю, когда это изменилось.
 Я думаю, может быть, в этом году.
 Но я думаю, что это хороший пример всего этого значения: в электронном письме есть дополнительная информация, но ничего о соблюдении DESE, и генеральный прокурор не нашел ее, но кто?
 Нотариус?
 Нет, ты знаешь, если ты много отсутствуешь, мы обычно получаем письмо автоматически, как от прокурора с юридическими документами. Да, и еще есть много угроз. Как мы помогаем вашим ученикам получить образование?
 Вот почему мы здесь.
 Это то, чего мы хотим.
 Это может показаться мелочью, но это письмо
 В нем описаны изменения, которые я увидел в округе с тех пор, как он стал временным округом, и это действительно здорово.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4189.901s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Могу ли я это подчеркнуть?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4190.902s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4191.462s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Это лишь один пример горизонтальной линии, к которой мы принадлежим.
 Потому что для того, чтобы семья получила помощь, иногда приходится говорить о юридической стороне получения помощи, а помощь то получаешь, то не получаешь.
 Речь – это часть способа нашего общения.
 Поэтому мы можем разделить это чувство принадлежности.
 Спасибо за вашу оценку.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4218.187s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: На самом деле, я думаю, это точное описание того, что я чувствую в этой области с тех пор, как вы вступили в должность.
 Кроме того, последние восемь лет я задавал себе вопрос: что такое общественная школа?
 Я не думаю, что у меня есть удовлетворительный ответ.
 Кажется, я начинаю понимать, что по своей сути это просто видеомагазин.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4246.366s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Это тоже принесет летнюю радость.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4249.81s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Но мне легче слышать эти слова.
 Теперь я понимаю, что это такое, и рад слышать, что этому уделяется много внимания, потому что
 Я знаю, что в сообществе есть люди, которые недовольны изменениями, и я думаю, что мы можем добиться большего, но нам также необходимо понять, что они собой представляют, какими мы хотим, чтобы они были и как мы хотим поддерживать сообщество.
 Так что я очень рад, что это произойдет.
 Для общения друг с другом и вокруг событий (например, нестандартных предметов повседневного обихода)
 Проводите ли вы каждое вскрытие, чтобы определить, было ли сообщение хорошо принято или было ли оно хорошо принято, и как мы можем гарантировать, что последующее вторжение в здание связи достигнет своей цели?
 Из-за бомбы
 В то время жалоба заключалась в том, что я не думаю, что с волной разгневанных людей что-то не так.
 Я просто хочу быть уверен, что в следующий раз, когда это произойдет, мы справимся лучше.
 Нам не обязательно преуспевать только потому, что вы практикуетесь.
 Но проводите ли вы посткриминалистическую экспертизу всех сообщений, связанных с инцидентом?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4332.934s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Мы так делаем по большей части, не все, но я думаю, они гарантируют этот уровень.
 Вот что мы делаем в этой ситуации.
 У нас есть более одного уровня.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4344.195s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Идеальный.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4345.336s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Это верно.
 Это будет важно для наших будущих операций и решений.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4354.108s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Идеальный.
 У нас будет еще одна речь, может быть, осенью мы ее произнесем, простите, если я забуду о чтении, и как нам это сделать?
 Это верно.
 Потому что мне кажется, что мы вступаем в четвертый или третий год инноваций, верно?
 Я думаю, что в первый год это было похоже на
 Давайте разберемся, как мы это делаем, данных не существует, и вы знаете, что у них есть расширение.
 Трудно понять цифры, но я надеюсь, вы видите, что мы на самом деле делаем что-то правильно.
 Потому что мы продвигаем государство в этом вопросе и следим за тем, чтобы все дети читали на одном уровне.
 Излишне говорить, что это важное требование для всего, что мы здесь делаем.
 В это время.
 Да, спасибо.</p>

 មានការផ្លាស់ប្តូរដ៏ធំនៅក្នុងតំបន់ក្នុងរយៈពេលមួយឆ្នាំកន្លងមកនេះ ដោយចាប់ផ្តើមជាមួយនឹងការផ្លាស់ប្តូរកាលវិភាគ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​លទ្ធផល​មិន​ល្អ​ឥត​ខ្ចោះ​ទេ។

 តាមទស្សនៈនៃការចរចា ការមានលោកបណ្ឌិត Gallusi នៅតុមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ ពីព្រោះយើងបានពិភាក្សាជាច្រើនអំពីទិដ្ឋភាពនៃការបង្រៀន និងផលប៉ះពាល់នៃអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងស្នើសុំ ដែលនៅពេលនោះហាក់ដូចជារដ្ឋបាលនៅក្នុងធម្មជាតិ ប៉ុន្តែវាមិនមែនទេ។

 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ពិត​ជា​សំខាន់ ហើយ​មាន​មួយ។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថា យើងមិនបានឃើញកាលវិភាគល្អបំផុតនៅក្នុងវិទ្យាល័យ និងវគ្គសិក្សាពិបាកៗទេ ចាប់តាំងពីឆ្នាំសិក្សាថ្មីមក។
 មិនអីទេ
 ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេបានសុំឱ្យខ្ញុំប្រើ DESE ហើយឈ្នះ
 លេខាធិការអប់រំ និងអភិបាលរងបានមកទីនេះ ហើយខ្ញុំអាចមើលបាតុកម្មនេះ និងនិយាយជាមួយពួកគេអំពីរបៀបដែលយើងធ្វើនៅទីនេះ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេឃើញការធ្វើបែបនេះនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍ផ្សេងទៀត។
 នេះ​គឺ​ជា​វិធី​សាស្រ្ត​គិត​យ៉ាង​ខ្លាំង​ដែល​ជួយ​កាត់​បន្ថយ​ការ​សរសេរ​កម្មវិធី និង​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម​មួយ​ចំនួន
 វាជាការគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការមើលថាតើការយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ទាំងអស់នេះទទួលបានប៉ុន្មានក្នុងឆ្នាំដំបូងរបស់យើង និងដំណើរកម្សាន្តលើកដំបូងរបស់យើង ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាស្ញប់ស្ញែងចំពោះក្រុមដែលពួកគេបានរួមគ្នា។
 ទាំងនេះកើតឡើងដោយសារតែអ្នកជារឿយៗមិនទទួលបានឥណទាននៅពេលអ្នកដាក់ពាក្យរហូតដល់ពេលក្រោយ។
 វាគ្រប់គ្រាន់ក្នុងការនិយាយ ទាំងអស់នេះគឺជាលទ្ធផលនៃការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងជាច្រើន ជាពិសេសចាប់តាំងពីដើមអាណត្តិរបស់គាត់មានមុខតំណែងជាច្រើននៅទំនេរ។
 ពេលខ្លះអ្នកគឺជាមនុស្សតែម្នាក់គត់នៅកន្លែងខ្លះ ហើយអ្នកត្រូវដោះស្រាយជាមួយនឹងអ្វីដែលនឹងមកដល់ និងធ្វើឱ្យតំបន់មានស្ថេរភាព។
 ស្ថេរភាពទាំងអស់នេះហាក់ដូចជានៅឆ្ងាយ។
 បាទ យើងបានធ្វើ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលសន្និសីទនេះ និងរឿងល្អទាំងអស់នេះនិយាយអំពី។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​នៅ​ពី​ក្រោយ​ឆាក​អ្វី​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ការ​ដើម្បី​រក្សា​ស្ថិរភាព​តំបន់​គឺ​ពិត​ប្រាកដ
 អ្វីមួយដែលធំជាងអ្វីដែលអ្នកអាចដាក់នៅលើស្លាយ។
 នេះ​ហាក់​ដូចជា​វែងឆ្ងាយ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​បាន​ធ្វើ​វា​ដោយ​យុត្តិធម៌​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិនិត្យ​របស់​អ្នក​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំរីករាយដែលវាស្ថិតនៅក្នុងកញ្ចក់មើលក្រោយ។

 Я рад, что первым днем моего временного назначения стал день издания указа.
 Так что с самого начала было много работы и много общения.
 Прошел целый год.
 Я благодарен своей семье за ​​понимание и поддержку.
 Не совсем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4714.008s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: М.П. Рейнфельд, а затем представители наших студентов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4718.065s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Спасибо.
 Как сказал конгрессмен Руссо, там было очень многолюдно.
 Когда я думаю об этом, я думаю о встрече, на которой мы должны немедленно назначить временного офицера, и мы подходим к столу и спрашиваем, что мы ищем.
 Некоторые думают, что когда мы перейдем к новому руководству, наступит гармония.
 Некоторые люди говорят, что у него есть сила изменить ситуацию.
 Я думаю, что новое руководство действительно отражает обе стороны, и я удовлетворен тем балансом, который мы видим, но не просто балансом этих хороших пропорций, у нас есть решение, и давайте двигаться дальше.
 Это отражает некоторые происходящие переоценки, и это то, что нам нужно не только на местах в определенных ситуациях, но и на самом деле, где мы находимся сегодня?
 Так что я очень благодарен.
 У меня небольшой вопрос к членам Руссо.
 Поэтому я думаю, что важно об этом подумать.
 Я считаю, что важно об этом подумать.
 Я считаю, что важно об этом подумать.
 Убедитесь, что это происходит, это протокол и ясность вокруг них.
 Поэтому я думаю, что здесь сложная тема для общения, но понимать методы лидерства полезно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4813.631s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 100% Я думаю, что эта презентация может быть связана с работой местного комитета безопасности.
 Мы многое услышали от членов нашей команды.
 В частности, речь идет об уровне профессионального развития или его отсутствии, прикрепленном к соглашению «Я люблю тебя».
 Так что это действительно приоритет в повестке дня Господа.
 Думаю, мы немного обсудили это на сегодняшней встрече, так что на школьном уровне можно поговорить об обучении и пересмотре ожиданий в отношении протокола.
 Итак, есть некоторые вещи, которыми мы не хотим делиться с сообществом по соображениям безопасности, но я думаю, что прогресс, который рассматривает и реализует окружное собрание, можно разделить на 100%.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4878.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Спасибо
 И я думаю, что есть недостающий элемент, я думаю, вы не говорите это, а нанимаете менеджера по доставке.
 Я очень ценю ваши мысли о персонале и коллегах и о том, как лучше всего разделить эти задачи.
 Вы говорили об этом на уровне среднего руководства, но я думаю, что это происходит и на другом уровне.
 О, да.
 Я это заметил и хотел бы это прокомментировать.
 Спасибо
 Итак, я подведу итог, потому что я знаю, что другим есть что сказать, видя эти элементы действий и прогресса, я думаю, это действительно помогает определить, о чем нам нужно отчитываться, какой комитет на следующий срок, что мы хотим видеть, какие решения нам нужны.
 Мы работаем вместе, поэтому я думаю, что ваши отзывы о партнерстве в начале очень ценны, и я отражу их вам, поскольку очень полезно понять, что происходит за кулисами и за кулисами, поэтому спасибо за ваше время.
 Я знаю, что подготовка всего остального здесь может занять много времени, поэтому большое спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4952.009s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Спасибо, Рейнфельд-Арачи, и я думаю, у нас есть Орапар и Пру.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4962.113s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Спасибо
 Я знаю, что члены моего комитета говорили об этом, но это было очень интересно.
 Я думаю, что вы уже давно сосредоточились на этих многих темах.
 Я хочу передать тебе поздравления.
 У меня есть несколько вопросов, но я хочу ответить на них как можно скорее, потому что знаю, что другие участники все еще хотят уйти.
 Я знаю, что некоторые другие мои члены говорят о пересмотре учебной программы по здравоохранению и гуманитарным наукам.
 Кто несет ответственность за этот процесс проверки?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4997.816s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Что ж, доктор Ким Тэлбот, помощник директора по спорту, берет перерыв для исследований и советов.
 Есть ли новое название?
 Он будет помогать возглавить усилия, но директором по легкой атлетике и здоровью является Рэйчел Перри, поэтому они будут руководить усилиями вместе.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5023.072s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Очень хорошо, спасибо.
 Я не знаю, что это за слайд.
 Я думаю, что это улучшенная база данных для принятия решений в сфере образования.
 Вы сказали, что данные вы будете собирать через эту новую аналитическую платформу и так далее. Будет использоваться в режиме реального времени для создания инструкций и многого другого.
 Я думаю, вы можете привести мне пример того, как вы хотите этого добиться или как это сделать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5057.953s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Вообще-то, ты говоришь? Извини, Ладжи, из-за жары, я хочу убедиться, что правильно слышу.
 Вы имеете в виду Open Architect?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5065.538s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Да, я просто помню, как вы говорили или в моих заметках, что некоторые из этих данных будут использоваться в режиме реального времени.
 Это привлекло мое внимание, поэтому мне было интересно, можете ли вы привести мне пример.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5076.184s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Абсолютно.
 Так что реальное время не нужно
 В классе.
 Случай.
 Но суть в том, что нам не нужно ждать обзора в конце поста.
 Нам не нужно рассматривать важные моменты в середине года, начале года и конце года.
 Режим реального времени означает, что учителя будут иметь доступ к данным, используя эти информационные панели, Hill for Literacy и эту платформу с открытой архитектурой.
 Эта информация часто используется и может служить основой для ежедневного или еженедельного планирования и консультаций.
 Поэтому при планировании дня недели вы можете использовать разные модели данных.
 Некоторые из них также представляют собой данные, собранные учителями только для
 Отзывы студентов (только по почте) позволяют предположить, что у учителей есть много способов использовать данные, которые они могут предоставлять в режиме реального времени, что повлияет на их планирование и преподавание.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5151.117s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Можете ли вы представить себе уровень класса, где учителя могут просматривать эти данные и, возможно, предлагать, в каких областях они проводят большую часть своего времени, или на уровне конкретного ученика, где они могут видеть, что ученики борются и хотят помочь, или и то, и другое?
 Как… все выше.
 Идеальный.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5170.553s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: То же самое происходит на уровне ученика, уровне класса, уровне факультета, уровне класса и уровне школы.
 Все это происходит, когда учителя работают индивидуально, чтобы обеспечить удовлетворение потребностей учащихся, работая с коллегами над данными на уровне класса или факультета, а руководители школ и деканы сотрудничают с учителями в широком масштабе.
 Это определенно подходит для всех уровней.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5203.812s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Это звучит очень хорошо с точки зрения учителей и воспитателей.
 Ребята, извините за ДИБЕЛОВ, их слишком много на этом слайде.
 Вы просто говорите, что исторически они помогали районным педагогам.
 Так это то, что ты сказал?
 Используйте системные данные для составления плана обучения.
 Ах, Дибс, спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5234.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Диббл Да.
 Спасибо
 Да, DIBLS используется для оценки уровня и способностей учащихся к чтению.
 Так что это выглядит по-другому.
 К в 2 года, как и в 3-5 лет, выглядит по-разному для каждого ученика и его уровня самостоятельного чтения.
 Dibbles служат стандартными инструментами и отслеживают прогресс.
 Поэтому в качестве справочного материала раздайте его каждому студенту в начале, середине и конце года.
 Это отслеживается различными способами и является данными, используемыми для отчетности.
 Но некоторым учащимся необходимо следить за прогрессом.
 Не каждый может это сделать, но ученикам младших классов необходимо следить за своим прогрессом.
 Некоторым учащимся может потребоваться присмотр.
 Каждые две недели, каждые четыре недели.
 Другие студенты могут приходить каждые шесть-восемь недель, так что это зависит от уровня потребности.
 Итак, этот Dibbles — это краткий минутный обзор.
 Это также используется для отслеживания прогресса, чтобы учителя могли отслеживать прогресс и прогресс в это время, чтобы они могли действительно сосредоточиться на своих целях.
 Ваше знакомство.
 Самое замечательное в платформе Hill Literacy, которую мы называем Continuum, заключается в том, что все данные передаются на этот форум.
 Учителя не только имеют доступ к данным, но и помогают им сосредоточиться на обучении конкретных учеников.
 У учителей это есть на уровне учеников.
 Эти данные затем можно использовать для группировки учащихся в соответствии с их потребностями и действительно сосредоточиться на обучении в группе.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5345.573s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Идеальный.
 Спасибо
 Извините, есть еще один.
 Если вы не знаете с самого начала, это нормально, но сравнима ли денежная стоимость Open Architect с предыдущими системами или это новая... это хороший вопрос.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5369.05s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Сначала я хочу начать с вопроса о Dibbles. Я думаю, что Dibbles важен, потому что Dibbles стоит всего один доллар на одного ученика.
 На самом деле вы платите только за платформу, поэтому это очень экономично.
 Открытый Архитектор, семь?
 Ох 20.
 20 000 долларов за посещение окрестностей.
 Таким образом, доступ к этой платформе имеют все сотрудники, преподаватели, учителя и администраторы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5402.482s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Понимать.

 Я просто хочу сказать, насколько мне это нравится, я думаю
 Вы дали нам полное и подробное объяснение.
 Я думаю, что за короткое время можно добиться многого.
 За что я очень благодарен с тех пор, как Вы пришли к власти, так это за чувство команды.
 Я думаю, это подчеркивает многое из того, что вы здесь подробно описали.
 Я думаю, что разговор об общении и сотрудничестве, включая участие лиц, осуществляющих уход, действительно важен.
 Многие родители, с которыми я публично разговаривал в прошлом месяце, рассказывали о том волнении, которое они испытали, когда их ученики вернулись из школы.
 Представление о том, что стать полностью вовлеченным родителем становится все труднее из-за стоимости жизни (например, трудностей с планированием занятий).
 В результате мы каждый день отправляем учеников в школу и не так активны, как хотелось бы.
 Я думаю, что, как вы упомянули, всегда есть возможности для совершенствования и общения, и я думаю, что широкой публике и студентам будет полезно больше понять о том, что происходит.
 Я думаю, я просто надеюсь, что они смогут понять, что собственность означает сохранение этого чувства принадлежности, когда мы перейдем к следующим двум семестрам или четвертям школы, а затем к следующему учебному году.
 Я думаю, ты действительно забил этот гвоздь, поэтому я просто хочу поблагодарить тебя за это.

 Предстоит многое сделать, и я буду следить за происходящим в долгосрочной перспективе.
 Я многому научился в этой области.
 Однако один из моих вопросов — как собрать обратную связь.
 Я знаю, что это упоминалось много раз.
 Знаете, что-то идет хорошо, что-то не очень, может быть, крайний срок, или, например, коллекционер совершенствует открытые архитекторы или другие программы развития навыков и выясняет, работают ли они, или люди их принимают, или они студенты или преподаватели.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5532.189s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Это очень хороший вопрос.
 Ой, я не рядом с микрофоном.
 Это очень хороший вопрос.
 Я бы сказал да
 Когда мы встречаемся, когда развиваем навыки, всегда есть победа.
 На самом деле мы используем эти данные для структурирования и улучшения нашей следующей встречи, и мы очень заинтересованы в этом.
 О том, как мы можем уважать обратную связь, когда меняем образ действий.
 Я думаю, что мы провели много исследований.
 Я думаю, что это отражает некоторые из моих текущих мыслей о том, как собирать данные.
 Вы знаете, мы получаем обратную связь от опросов, но они не всегда отражают содержание Медфорда.
 Для нас это постоянная работа.
 Некоторые уровни данных маршрута остаются.
 Поэтому, когда вы встречаете кого-то
 Этот уровень обратной связи также возникает, когда я встречаюсь с людьми в дороге, когда мы идем в школу, когда посещаем конференции.
 Одна из вещей, которую мы делаем как основная руководящая группа, — это пытаемся создавать целевые страницы и электронные таблицы.
 Пожалуйста, дайте нам возможность импортировать эти данные.
 В частности, у нас с доктором Тэлботом есть такое место, поэтому, когда мы слышим, что что-то происходит или что-то происходит, у нас есть место, чтобы это записать, чтобы мы могли к этому вернуться.
 Подобно тому, как менеджеры делают или любят ставить цели, чтобы люди знали, куда они могут обратиться за информацией.
 Но я могу сказать, что отчасти это тоже работа, которую мы делаем.
 Я думаю, что предстоящий форум станет еще одним местом для сбора отзывов и предложений от реальных людей.
 Я знал, что будет и опрос, но во время встречи собрал много важных данных.
 При участии комитета и рабочей группы.
 Но опять же, это лишь часть того, как мы обеспечиваем, чтобы каждый имел право голоса.
 Это то, что нужно делать всегда.</p>

 Короче говоря, капитан.
 Это моя первая встреча, и я очень рад слышать обо всей работе, которую делают все, особенно руководство.
 Меня интересуют три вещи: Происходит много институциональных изменений и инноваций.
 Это тяжелая работа, занимает много времени и выглядит очень красиво.
 Это наглядно отражено в работе, которой вы хотите с нами поделиться.
 Во-вторых, поддержка концепции разработки учебных программ освобождает наших преподавателей от траты времени на создание учебных программ и действительно сосредотачивает внимание на том, как они представляют учебную программу и пытаются построить эти отношения.
 Это реальный коэффициент силы.
 Еще раз очень хочу поздравить вас и вашу команду.
 Замечательно.
 Наконец, меня больше всего беспокоят общественные школы.
 Это общественный ресурс.
 Я считаю, что нам, менеджерам и управляющим этих мест, необходимо найти баланс между справедливостью отношений между поколениями.
 Это позволяет вам поддерживать своих пользователей сейчас и сохранять эти активы для будущих пользователей (10, 20, 30 лет).
 Поэтому я очень рад видеть, что ваша команда привносит в наше обсуждение будущего общественных школ.
 Но большое спасибо за руководство.</p>

 Прежде чем мы оставим эту тему, я хочу убедиться, что мы объяснили сообществу следующие шаги в процессе оценки менеджеров.
 Итак, я позволю членам Орапада сказать вам это.
 Но я думаю, что это моя проблема.
 Опять же, с намерением составить аналогичный план по вопросу MSBA, надеемся ли мы еще рассмотреть и рассмотреть этот вопрос вместе на 26-м заседании?
 Вам нужна помощь этого комитета?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5839.358s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Это очень хороший вопрос.
 Это будет сообщено участникам, которые с нами общаются.

 Этот отчет будет опубликован завтра утром, чтобы каждый из нас, получив оценку сверху, мог подготовить свои идеи и стремления и отправить их сообществу.
 Затем я возьму эти данные и скомпилирую их в короткое сообщение.
 Я хочу дать понять публике, что то, что я собираюсь прочитать, представляет собой комбинацию всех моих идей и точек зрения.
 Это определяется участниками на последнем собрании, поэтому оно не будет решаться отдельными членами, если участники не почувствуют, что им нужно что-то сказать, но часто это не стандарт или не та модель, которой мы следуем, но он будет готов 26-го числа.

 Большая часть этой работы была проделана в сотрудничестве с моим директором по связям с общественностью Уиллом Пиппичелли.
 Именно поэтому мы сохраняем этот сайт.
 Мы обновили наш сайт.
 Мы продолжаем обновлять наш веб-сайт, чтобы обеспечить максимально полную информацию семьям в нашем сообществе.
 Когда мы что-то отправляем, мы отправляем нашу контактную информацию.
 Через форум FinalSight, на котором размещен этот сайт.
 Он автоматически переведет контактную информацию семьи.
 Мы также используем программу под названием Talking Points, которая похожа на приложение для обмена сообщениями, поэтому администраторы могут нажать на нее на своем телефоне или устройстве, и она автоматически переведет все необходимые файлы.
 У нас также есть страница Медфордской государственной школы в Facebook, и это вы.
 DiPipaselli будет регулярно обновляться.

 Но это, я имею в виду, ты знаешь
 Когда газета закончилась, людям некуда было идти.
 Например, если вы зайдете на Facebook, в Medford Politics насчитывается 2000 человек, большинство из которых, вероятно, живут в Медфорде.
 Они могут быть уверены, что, когда они были там, они были в контакте с Медфордом и были в контакте с чем-то из Медфорда.
 Я думаю, что это вызов, и я думаю, что у всего города нет другого способа общаться, кроме как постучать в дверь или бросить что-нибудь.
 Очевидно, что и то, и другое очень дорого.
 Я думаю, что мы находимся в печальной ситуации, особенно когда мы говорим о новых средних школах.
 Знаете, когда мы говорим о новых средних школах, мы не можем написать редакционную статью в газету и думать, что добьемся большинства избирателей.
 Так что это настоящий вызов нашего времени.

 សូមអរគុណ
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​ឆ្លៀត​ពេល​ខ្លះ​ដើម្បី​និយាយ​អំពី​ប្រតិទិន​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។

 នេះគឺជារឿងមួយចំនួនដែលត្រូវចងចាំនៅពេលអ្នកគ្រោងសម្រាប់ឆ្នាំសិក្សា 2026-27៖ ទិវាពលកម្មគឺហួសពេលយូរហើយ។
 ដូចដែលអ្នកអាចឃើញនៅទីនេះ ទិវាពលកម្មគឺថ្ងៃទី 7 ខែកញ្ញាដែលមានន័យថាយោងទៅតាមកិច្ចសន្យា។

 ថ្ងៃទី 23 ខែមិថុនាគឺជាថ្ងៃចុងក្រោយនៃសាលារៀនសម្រាប់ថ្ងៃដែលគ្មានព្រិល។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើមានថ្ងៃធ្លាក់ព្រិល យើងត្រូវបន្ថែមវាបន្ទាប់ពីថ្ងៃទី 23 ខែមិថុនា។
 ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សា ខ្ញុំក៏ចង់មានតម្លាភាពផងដែរ។
 នៅពេលដែលប្រតិទិនត្រូវបានដាក់ឱ្យដំណើរការកាលពីឆ្នាំមុន ដោយសារថ្ងៃឈប់សម្រាកមួយចំនួន។
 មានមតិមួយដែលថាថ្ងៃបុណ្យធំៗត្រូវបានប្រារព្ធឡើងសម្រាប់ហេតុផលសាសនា ហើយខ្ញុំស្អប់ក្នុងការនិយាយវាតិចបំផុត ប៉ុន្តែសម្រាប់ការខ្វះពាក្យល្អជាងនេះ ពួកគេមិនមែនជាថ្ងៃបុណ្យសំខាន់ដែលសមនឹងការប្រារព្ធនោះទេ។
 យើង​នឹង​ចាត់​វិធានការ​ដូច​គ្នា​នៅ​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ចង្អុល​បង្ហាញ​ថា ជា​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ រហូត​មក​ដល់​ឆ្នាំ​នេះ សាលា​សាធារណៈ Medford នៅ​តែ​មាន Good Friday។
 នេះជាឆ្នាំដំបូង។
 នេះជាថ្ងៃសិក្សា មិនមែនជាថ្ងៃសម្រាកទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ប្រតិទិនដែលបានស្នើឡើងនៅឆ្នាំក្រោយក៏រួមបញ្ចូលថ្ងៃសុក្រល្អជាថ្ងៃសិក្សាផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមជូនពរអ្នកឱ្យល្អបំផុត ប៉ុន្តែយើងក៏មិននៅទីនេះដែរ។
 ដូចអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានជួបប្រទះនៅថ្ងៃនោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា យើង​មិន​ត្រូវ​បាន​រារាំង​ដោយ​បញ្ហា​ផ្ទាល់​ខ្លួន​ទេ។

 លើសពីនេះទៀត ផ្នែកតែមួយគត់គឺថា DESI មានបទប្បញ្ញត្តិទាក់ទងនឹងពេលវេលានៃការបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សា និងគម្លាតរវាងការបញ្ចប់ថ្នាក់វិទ្យាល័យ និងថ្ងៃចុងក្រោយនៃការចូលរៀននៅក្នុងស្រុក។
 ហើយចំនួនមនុស្សមិនអាចលើសពី 12 នាក់។
 នោះមានន័យថាថ្នាក់ឆ្នាំក្រោយនៃឆ្នាំ 2027 អាចបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅព្រឹកថ្ងៃសុក្រទី 4 ខែមិថុនា។
 ដូច្នេះ យោងតាមបទប្បញ្ញត្តិរបស់ DESI យើងត្រូវផ្លាស់ទីវាពីថ្ងៃពុធដល់ថ្ងៃសុក្រ។
 ក្រៅ​ពី​នោះ យើង​ពិត​ជា​ធ្វើ​តាម​រចនាសម្ព័ន្ធ​ដូច​ឆ្នាំ​នេះ​ដែរ។

 Я просто хочу сказать, что мы приняли этот принцип в 2020 году, в первый год, когда календарь представлен должным образом, поэтому я хочу вас поблагодарить.
 На самом деле это непросто сделать, потому что вы сказали, что знаете, что я хочу посмотреть на даты 2026 года и посмотреть, о, но мне нужны некоторые из этих дат как 2027 год, но для дат после 1 сентября мне нужен 2026 год.
 Иногда уставший и растерянный.
 Я принял нашу политику и предложенный календарь и, увидев его, вы знаете, спросил GPT Chat о дате этого года.
 Даже я совершил некоторые ошибки и почти послал вам сообщение, что все так плохо.
 Но я этого не сделал, потому что знал, что ошибался.
 Поэтому я подтверждаю, что это правда.
 И, скажу честно, нам так повезло в этом году, что на субботу выпадает так много праздников, так много религиозных праздников, что у нас нет школ по субботам или, откровенно говоря, по субботам и воскресеньям.
 Так что с точки зрения школы нам очень повезло.
 В прошлом году нам очень повезло.
 Поэтому я рад, что нам не пришлось этого делать.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6590.903s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Thank you.
 I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.
 So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.
 So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.
 We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.
 But they already were on board and working.
 And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can
 And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?
 So what happens today?
 How does it happen?
 Where is the ledge?
 Where is the playing field?
 How does traffic flow?
 Where are the challenges?
 And all of that good stuff.
 So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to
 And I think that's a really good question.
 I think that's a really good question.
 And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.
 So they've been doing all of that work.
 They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.
 So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.
 They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.
 There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.
 All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.
 At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.
 That work has been really interesting to watch.
 So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.
 So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.
 And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.
 And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.
 What do you do?
 How do you do it?
 Where do you do it?
 All of that good stuff.
 So all of that happened.
 That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.
 Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.
 So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?
 So it's very educationally focused.
 It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having
 grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.
 So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.
 It started with a shadow day and
 Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.
 Arrival, lunch, passing periods.
 like all of it.
 Right.
 So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.
 He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.
 I think they saw four schools in a day.
 Is that right.
 To help our team understand what's possible.
 Right.
 Because many people
 have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.
 So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.
 So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.
 Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,
 and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.
 And I got to be part of that two-day session.
 And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.
 And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.
 And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.
 So he was super skillful and artful.
 just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.
 So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.
 So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like
 The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.
 what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?
 And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.
 And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.
 But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate
 What are we going to do in the building?
 And how are we going to do it?
 And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.
 And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.
 Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?
 And is it an open space or a closed space?
 That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is
 a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.
 Like why do you need a new space, right?
 So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.
 And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.
 And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.
 And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.
 And then we have this set of sessions.
 And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?
 And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.
 And
 She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.
 And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.
 And we're like, fair, right?
 Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.
 But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.
 And we were like, why?
 Why wouldn't you do it there?
 And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.
 And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,
 maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.
 Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?
 I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?
 Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?
 And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,
 like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say
 do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?
 And the answer is like, absolutely not.
 Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.
 So out of all of that will come an educational plan.
 And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.
 So we'll be introducing it then.
 So SMMA will be here with us.
 We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.
 But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,
 is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.
 Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.
 And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.
 So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.
 Preliminary design plan.
 And that PDP includes the educational plan.
 That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.
 And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space
 concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.
 That work is for the building committee to do.
 So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.
 But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.
 So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.
 And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from
 Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.
 The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.
 Where will the building go and what will it look like?
 Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?
 So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.
 So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.
 so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?
 So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.
 And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.
 lots of chances for community input in those sessions.
 So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.
 And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.
 So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.
 Translation services will be available.
 We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.
 They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks
 Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.
 And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.
 We'll collect a lot of questions.
 We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.
 And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.
 And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.
 And there'll be a place for public input.
 And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.
 We're working on plans for that.
 Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.
 So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.
 And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?
 Like the building could be here, it could be there.
 That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.
 So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?
 How many classrooms is it?
 that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,
 And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.
 That's why the ed plan is so important.
 So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.
 And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.
 And that's false.
 It's almost completely false.
 I think there's one program where that is true.
 And it's like a marginal change.
 In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.
 So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.
 It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan
 is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?
 One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.
 They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.
 And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.
 What's the other one?
 Fitness center.
 So, and it's not like marginally bigger.
 What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.
 So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.
 So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think
 part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.
 But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.
 It's been a lot of really not glorious,
 And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not
 the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.
 They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.
 So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.
 But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.
 So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.
 So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.
 Let's see, where'd it go?
 Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.
 I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.
 And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.
 One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.
 And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.
 And to create a higher quality,
 video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.
 None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.
 So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.
 On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.
 This is where we're going to start to see concepts.
 This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.
 And then we will
 Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.
 we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.
 The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.
 We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.
 Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.
 On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.
 On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.
 So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.
 All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.
 There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.
 And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.
 That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.
 By June we will have one.
 So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish
 How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?
 So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.
 But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.
 Tell us what you think about them.
 So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.
 And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.
 where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.
 So that's the next three months of this project.
 So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?
 No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.
 and cost.
 So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.
 We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized
 doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.
 There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.
 There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.
 But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.
 So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.
 But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8120.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Депутат Рейнфельд.
 Спасибо
 Это интересно.
 Да, наконец.
 Это верно.
 Я очень рад этому.
 Итак, мой первый вопрос: можем ли мы позаимствовать что-нибудь из этого занятия, чтобы использовать его в ходе нашего совещания по стратегическому планированию?
 Потому что это звучит великолепно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8136.725s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Отличный опыт.
 Я думаю, что некоторые люди в комнате сказали, что мы должны сделать это со всеми учителями средней школы.
 Итак, вокруг того, что может произойти, много энергии.
 Я думаю, одно из показаний Майка
 Он спросил, кто был директором организации, когда услышал о том, что школа что-то строит и не использует?
 Вы слышите это все время.
 Он сказал, что это произошло потому, что
 Люди перечисляют свои надежды, мечты и стремления.
 «Было бы здорово, если бы у нас были эти вещи», — сказали они.
 Затем все закрывают список надежд, мечтаний и стремлений и ждут завершения строительства.
 И, надеюсь, это здание изменит их.
 И это здание этого не сделает.
 Изменения должны происходить с людьми, потому что они действительно нуждаются в переменах, верно?
 Итак, мы немного поговорили
 Когда мы впервые разрабатываем план обучения, какие возможности для профессионального развития и встреч должны быть предоставлены, чтобы действительно начать совместное развитие?
 Что мы можем сделать до открытия этого здания?
 Когда мы сможем сделать это?
 И какая помощь нужна.
 Это еще одна работа, проделанная группой планирования образования.
 Конечно, я сказал: «Я рад дать вам совет».
 Я с удовольствием расскажу вам, как это сделать самостоятельно.
 Я рад помочь вам сделать это.
 Но да, я думаю, что это правда, поскольку он проделал огромную работу, вводя людей в заблуждение тем, что, по их мнению, они пытались нам сказать.
 Это важно, и это высококвалифицированная работа, поэтому я думаю, что вам важно тщательно продумать свой следующий шаг.
 Я думаю, что мы будем использовать многие из тех же методов на занятиях по стратегическому планированию, хотя у нас будет немного меньше контроля над аудиторией, поэтому мы изучим это.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8273.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Это очень исцеляет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8275.047s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Да, да.
 Да, я думаю, что когда у вас хорошо организованная аудитория, вы действительно можете взять на себя инициативу, и мы также стараемся провести двухчасовую сессию по стратегическому планированию.
 У нас есть два дня.
 Поэтому наши действия должны быть немного разными, но наверняка применимы многие из одних и тех же идей.
 Да, я хочу, чтобы люди могли поделиться этим методом. Да, я думаю, что мы можем сказать вам одно: как мы это поймаем, потому что я думаю, что это действительно
 Это великая вещь, которая произошла, и я думаю, что, возможно, мы сможем поговорить об этом в какой-то момент.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8311.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, что не думаю, что моим детям она понравится, но сегодня я получила статью. Но в школе было холоднее, чем на улице, и однажды я учила архитектора плести волосы по-французски.
 Так что приятно видеть, что этот студент уделяет внимание.
 Поэтому я думаю, что мои остальные вопросы сейчас в основном касаются общения с сообществом.
 Я рад, что Саймон донес эту идею до людей за пределами школьного сообщества.
 У нас есть много стратегий, чтобы сделать это, и я хочу это сделать.
 Мне нравится публиковать эту информацию на форуме, через дискуссионные форумы или по электронной почте из школы.
 Я знаю, что это не обязательно относится ко всему сообществу Медфорда, но мне кажется, что я смотрю на всех директоров начальных школ в аудитории, а это ученики, которые живут в этом здании и в средней школе.
 Так что было бы неплохо, если бы мы могли сделать это объявление в среду, но мне интересно, можем ли мы сделать что-то вроде флаера с отказом в это время в зависимости от погоды в Новой Англии и т. д. Но как зарегистрироваться и есть ли информационный бюллетень, но как хранить информацию о программе, и если мы сможем что-то найти, это действительно можно найти.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8399.811s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Да, там тоже что-то готовится.
 Мы отправим вам напоминание.
 Свяжусь со Стивом в мэрии, чтобы уведомить его о встрече.
 Идеальный.
 Представитель по связям с общественностью уведомит сообщества, нуждающиеся в услугах перевода, об этой встрече.
 Пока мы говорим о важных датах, еще одна вещь, которую мы сегодня обсуждаем с представителями сообщества, — это то, как дать людям точный список предстоящих событий.
 Итак, когда мы соберем все вместе, мы сможем сделать много вещей, в том числе несколько листовок и рюкзаков.
 Таким образом, общение о встречах происходит двумя разными способами.
 Мы отправим вам напоминание, а затем сможем сказать:
 Как и «След хлебных крошек», вечеринка для школьников начальной школы, ее также можно рекламировать по всем этим каналам.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8457.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: ព្រោះខ្ញុំគិតថាការធ្វើបែបនេះតាមសាលារៀនអាចទាក់ទងគ្រួសារយើងខ្លះ។
 IMHO ពួកគេប្រហែលជាមិនធ្វើតាមអនុស្សរណៈប្រចាំសប្តាហ៍ដែលត្រូវបានហាមឃាត់នោះទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8466.62s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Это верно.
 Я думаю, что еще одна вещь, о которой мы собираемся поговорить, — это то, как создать информационный бюллетень по электронной почте, который можно использовать для общения с более широким кругом, чем школьное сообщество, чтобы те члены сообщества, которые хотят получать четкую информацию о проблемах комитета, могли это сделать.
 Итак, у нас есть много вещей, ориентированных на отношения.
 Мы начнем двигаться вперед, чтобы построить более широкую базу, чем образованные.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8496.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Идеальный.
 Думаю, мой последний вопрос именно об этом.
 Я знаю, что когда вы только начинаете, существует подкомитет по коммуникации и участию сообщества, и мы просто хотим убедиться, что он остается активным и сильным.
 Если это тело что-нибудь знает.
 Половине людей лучше, хм, в этом зале комитета больше людей, чем их нет.
 Он работал в нескольких строительных комитетах в Сомервилле и является руководителем проекта объекта.
 Думаю, я здесь единственный, кто не занимается строительством.
 Но мы можем сделать все возможное, чтобы поддержать комитет в распространении этой информации.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8530.081s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Это верно.
 Эта подкомиссия давно не собиралась, поскольку вся наша работа сосредоточена на существующих условиях.
 Но я думаю, что у этой группы есть возможность собраться вместе, и я поговорю с членами команды о том, чтобы сделать что-то, что можно будет публиковать, например, ежемесячный информационный бюллетень или что-то, что можно будет написать в рамках строительного комитета.
 Итак, мы поговорим об этом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8554.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Замечательно.
 Моя цель состоит в том, чтобы никто не удивился, когда произойдет потеря права выкупа.
 О, конечно.
 Извините
 Будьте справедливы.
 Мы постараемся для этого.
 Или когда они задаются вопросом, где искать дополнительную информацию.
 Спасибо за всю вашу работу.
 Спасибо всем, кто это сделал, потому что я знаю, что это тяжелая работа.
 Я очень взволнован.</p>

 У меня всего лишь несколько коротких вопросов.
 Прежде всего, я знаю, что вы упомянули трафик, когда говорили о этапе разведки этого проекта.
 Поскольку это немного надуманно, есть ли у вас более подробная информация о том, что они делают, особенно о доставке?
 Я немного беспокоюсь по этому поводу.</p>
