 Good evening.
 So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.
 This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.
 always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.
 My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.
 None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.
 A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.
 This work is very demanding and it is very complex.
 and it keeps you on your toes.
 And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.
 And it is work that you take home with you.
 Yet it is carried out.
 in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.
 I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.
 Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.
 I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.
 Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.
 I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.
 The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.
 Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.
 I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.
 On the next slide, please.
 What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.
 So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.
 The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 During that time, we began to work
 a lot on our instructional excellence.
 We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.
 That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.
 You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.
 creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.
 It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.
 As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.
 This spoke about the work that I had done really working on
 the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.
 All of that to bring with me to this position.
 If we could please go to the next slide.
 This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.
 So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.
 I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence
 through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.
 I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.
 So to begin, our core values
 were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.
 They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.
 These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.
 So there is collaborative effort.
 and input put into the core values.
 Next slide, please.
 Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.
 We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.
 And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.
 So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.
 Who are we?
 How do we lead?
 What we expect?
 And how do we communicate?
 Next slide, please.
 So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.
 When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,
 a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.
 Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.
 uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.
 My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.
 That was the work that really began.
 It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.
 When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.
 Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.
 This slide talks about that.
 I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.
 It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.
 and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.
 I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.
 It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.
 This is something that is
 still growing.
 This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.
 It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.
 We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.
 They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.
 We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.
 We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.
 I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.
 This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful
 negotiations with the teachers.
 And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.
 And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.
 And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.
 And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,
 That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.
 And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.
 And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.
 This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.
 It also brought us recognition and a highlight
 from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.
 And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,
 on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.
 Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.
 Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.
 And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.
 So I do think it's important to note we've had a big
 reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
 My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.
 They're bringing with them years of
 experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.
 With that, I was very intentional.
 I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.
 and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.
 So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in
 her permanent position.
 We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.
 That's really helped to stabilize the district.
 It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.
 But they also started mid to late August.
 So we are still in the stages of building
 what we know we need to do.
 A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.
 The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.
 So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.
 But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.
 And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,
 is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.
 I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.
 Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Ruseau in all of the bargaining units.
 There was a significant amount of work done last year.
 We're still going with some other units.
 Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.
 So, strengthening operational foundations.
 What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.
 For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.
 Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.
 On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.
 Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.
 So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.
 in the short time he's been here so far.
 So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.
 This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.
 This has been part of ongoing conversations.
 Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.
 Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.
 That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.
 The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.
 Heating and roof leaks.
 par for the course in the past year.
 There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.
 We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.
 Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.
 A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.
 Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.
 To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered
 speedily through Amazon.
 And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.
 But you just don't know what's going to happen.
 And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.
 The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.
 Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.
 Strengthening safety.
 So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.
 Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.
 What that has looked like is an update.
 and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.
 This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.
 to mostly fruition.
 We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their
 ability to come in and out of work.
 So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.
 School-based and district-level safety committees.
 So those have begun.
 Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.
 And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.
 And I think he had a meeting today.
 This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.
 It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.
 And then lastly for operations would be community schools.
 This is an ongoing.
 area of focus and review.
 So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.
 That's mostly the rental of our buildings.
 It also sees our summer programming summer fun.
 but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.
 So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.
 Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating
 a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.
 We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start
 We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.
 That is an area where it wasn't
 completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.
 I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.
 And for them, some of this came as a surprise.
 So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.
 So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.
 Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.
 Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.
 That through line is our shared sense of belonging.
 It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are
 mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.
 So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that
 may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.
 So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so
 critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.
 And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.
 It was used for instruction.
 And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.
 more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.
 It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support
 is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.
 At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what
 individuals need.
 That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.
 And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging
 CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.
 And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day
 Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.
 dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.
 So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.
 Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.
 And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.
 High quality instructional materials
 make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.
 Next slide.
 Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.
 This is work that
 Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.
 We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.
 We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.
 We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students
 have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.
 We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.
 It's that transfer.
 Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.
 And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.
 The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.
 and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.
 Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.
 So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.
 She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.
 She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders
 and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.
 That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.
 They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.
 This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.
 Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.
 But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.
 This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.
 And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,
 is progress monitoring their students.
 Everyone has a caseload.
 We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.
 And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.
 Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.
 I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data
 In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.
 Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.
 One of this has been some of my favorite.
 I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year
 twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.
 And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,
 means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.
 with teachers in buildings.
 And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 She's had several meetings with them.
 OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.
 This is
 a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.
 So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.
 On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.
 MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.
 We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.
 And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.
 So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.
 We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment
 Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.
 And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.
 But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor
 is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.
 And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the
 caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.
 The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.
 Communication and partnership.
 In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.
 I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.
 It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.
 With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.
 And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.
 expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.
 We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.
 Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.
 Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that
 you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.
 This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 Administrators.
 Yes, yes.
 School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.
 When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.
 We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.
 And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.
 The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.
 I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.
 I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.
 We have some upcoming forums this month.
 But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,
 the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.
 So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.
 And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.
 We are very mindful though of our search committees.
 So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.
 So that is something that we have committed to
 before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.
 And there's the task force committee.
 So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.
 As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.
 who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.
 I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.
 I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.
 It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.
 So it's important that we hear from
 from all voices.
 An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.
 And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.
 And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.
 MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.
 And then just like one example of a district-based one is
 The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.
 I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.
 Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.
 I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.
 But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.
 But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.
 So that is ongoing work for myself.
 But I have really
 committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.
 I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.
 Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,
 but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.
 It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.
 And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 I just want to make sure that I am
 working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.
 And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.
 Next slide, please.
 So with all this said, planning for the future.
 So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.
 With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.
 They are goals that we want to maintain.
 It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.
 And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.
 So first, our continuing priorities.
 These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.
 The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.
 that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.
 So strengthening those supports for students
 so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.
 And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.
 Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.
 So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.
 And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.
 Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.
 also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.
 So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.
 I think that's an important thing to note.
 So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.
 And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.
 So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.
 And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.
 And I think
 each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.
 And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.
 I did highlight this in my
 report of interim findings.
 That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.
 So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.
 Enhancing communication and community trust.
 So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures
 making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.
 All of that is continuous work.
 and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.
 We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I
 it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.
 So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing
 And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.
 How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.
 That's work that will be continuing.
 Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.
 and how they're working with them.
 That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.
 And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.
 And our CBA before,
 did not have any layers of educator leadership.
 And now it does.
 And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.
 And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.
 That is work that is ongoing for us.
 Now moving to work that our new goals.
 And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.
 So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.
 This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.
 But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.
 One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.
 I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.
 This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction
 available effectively and meaningfully for students.
 That is work that is critical.
 the implementation of open architects.
 So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.
 And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.
 Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.
 So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.
 Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff
 at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.
 And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.
 And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.
 Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.
 This is a true goal here.
 Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.
 Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.
 I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.
 We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.
 And that is wonderful.
 And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.
 There might be one at the elementary.
 But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.
 Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.
 The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.
 She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think
 her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.
 But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.
 And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been
 Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.
 And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.
 Once we have a process, we find a way to
 fine tune and make it better.
 Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.
 I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision
 and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.
 Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.
 It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.
 And it's through the MSBA forum.
 And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.
 We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're
 getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.
 And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.
 So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.
 It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.
 And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.
 And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4045.305s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 那是很多。
 但首先，我想说我很兴奋，今天的声音非常大。
 我喜欢你可以一边走路一边嚼口香糖。
 我找不到一个听起来不那么美国化但每个人都能理解的好比喻。
 但很高兴看到您涵盖了多少不同的内容。
 好吧，坦率地说，你涵盖了看起来的一切。
 有好几次我想，哦，是的，我们也这样做，对吗？
 所以，正如你所知，沟通是存在的。
 比八年前开始时要好得多，我对我们所取得的进展感到兴奋。
 这是你是对的但永远无法完成的事情之一。
 我不知道是因为受众发生了变化，还是需要很长时间才能完全开发出一个每次都正确的系统。
 但我女儿今天上学迟到了，我想读一下我们收到的电子邮件中的两句话。
 据我所知，我们希望尽一切努力帮助您和您的学生缓解出勤问题。
 每当学生迟到时，我们都会担心，因为迟到会导致学生错过在学校的重要指导和学习机会。
 我只是不知道什么时候改变了。
 我想可能是今年。
 但我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明这一切都没有什么，电子邮件还有更多内容，但没有任何关于合规性和 DESE 的内容，也没有得到，不是司法部长，而是谁？
 公证人？
 不，你知道，如果你缺席很多次，我们常常会收到自动发送的信件，比如来自检察官的信件，其中包含法律术语。是的，然后就是很多威胁。这就是我们如何帮助您的学生接受教育？
 这就是我们在这里的原因。
 这就是我们想要的。
 这看起来是一件小事，但这封电子邮件却是如此
 描述了自从你成为临时学区以来我所看到的该地区的变化，所以这太棒了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4189.901s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 我可以强调这一点吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4190.902s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4191.462s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 这也只是我们归属位置这条横线的一个例子。
 因为对于一个家庭来说，要获得援助，有时您必须就与援助相关的法律部分进行对话，但在没有获得援助的情况下接受援助
 交谈是我们沟通方式的一部分。
 这样我们就可以分享这种归属感。
 感谢您的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4218.187s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 事实上，我认为这非常准确地描述了自从您接手以来我对该地区的感受。
 此外，八年来我一直在问自己：什么是社区学校？
 我认为我从未得到令人满意的答案。
 我觉得我开始明白，本质上，它只是一家音像商店。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4246.366s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 这也会在夏天带来乐趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4249.81s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 但对我来说，听到这些话确实会容易得多。
 现在我明白了它是什么，我很高兴知道它受到了很多关注，因为
 我知道社区中有些人对这些变化不满意，我认为我们可以做得更好，但我们也必须了解他们是什么，我们希望他们成为什么以及我们希望如何支持社区。
 所以我对这项工作的发生感到非常兴奋。
 对于围绕彼此、围绕事件（即非标准的日常事物）的通信，
 您是否对每一项都进行事后审查，以确定沟通是否未得到很好的接收，或者是否受到良好的接收，以及我们如何确保下次建筑物中发生入侵者事件时，沟通能够以正确的方式达到所有要求？
 因为轰炸
 后来的抱怨是，你知道，我不认为愤怒的人们潮水般涌来有什么问题。
 我只是想确保，就像下次发生这种情况时一样，我们做得更好。
 我们不一定做得很好，因为你有点像练习。
 但是您是否对每一个与事件相关的沟通进行事后审查？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4332.934s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 我们这样做是为了大多数人，而不是所有人，但我认为那些保证这个水平。
 在那种情况下我们就是这么做的。
 我们有不止一个不同级别的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4344.195s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 出色的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4345.336s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 是的。
 这对于我们未来的实践和决策非常重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4354.108s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 出色的。
 我们还会有另一场演讲，也许我们会在秋天举办一场，如果我忘记了，请原谅我，关于阅读以及我们如何做？
 是的。
 因为我觉得我们已经进入了真正更新这一切的第四年或第三年？
 我认为早些年就像
 了解我们是如何做到这一点的，嗯，数据不存在，而且你知道，它有一个尾巴。
 这些数据让人难以理解，但我希望我们看到我们确实做得对。
 因为我们在这方面远远领先于全州，并确保所有孩子都能达到同一年级的阅读水平。
 不用说，这是我们在这里所做的一切的关键要求。
 然后。
 是的，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4407.735s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 下个月将公布新数据。</p>

 我只是想说我非常感谢您的所有评论
 他们迄今为止所取得的成就和他们的计划符合这个团体以及我认为社区的期望。
 因此，我认为很长一段时间以来，我们都有一个校长议程、一个学校委员会议程和一个社区议程，每个人都有不同的议程，我们通常都朝着一个方向运作，但事实并非如此。
 我认为当你谈论对齐时很重要
 如果不匹配，您作为主管就不能拥有自己的议程。
 好的。
 如果它与社区的期望和我们的期望不相关。
 所以我真的很喜欢，即使当你设定目标时，你也会在这些目标之间划出一条界限，我们将继续努力，因为我们还没有达到目标。
 这些是
 我们认为这些都是重要的优先事项，对您来说很重要，但也会影响即将进行的战略规划对话，您知道这是非常必要的。
 所以，是的，我很欣赏那里的联系。
 我想其他评论就是我们所做的。
 去年这个地区发生了巨大的变化，首先是日程安排的变化。
 我认为结果并不完美。
 但我也认为，考虑到所有因素，一切进展得非常顺利。
 我相信
 从谈判的角度来看，让加鲁西博士坐在谈判桌上非常重要，因为我们讨论了很多关于教学方面和我们所要求的影响的问题，这在当时看起来可能是行政性质的，但事实并非如此。
 这就是它如何让我们在教学方面做一些不同的事情。
 所以我觉得这真的很重要，而且有一种
 主管有无数种方式参与幕后，以及公众无法直接看到但理解的事情，但尾巴终于出现了，我觉得对我来说，我们处于中间的那个类别中有很多事情。
 所以我认为我们还没有看到最好的高中时间表和具有挑战性的课程，因为现在是大一。
 好的。
 但他们要求我参加 DESE 并拥有
 教育部长和副州长来到这里，我能够观看这个演示并与他们讨论我们如何在这里实施这一点以及他们如何看待在其他社区实施这一点。
 这是一种非常周到的方法，可以缓解一些编程挑战，并且
 有趣的是，看到所有这一切在我们的第一年以及我们的第一次郊游中受到的关注程度，所以我向他们组建的团队致敬。
 发生这些事情是因为您通常要稍后才能获得实施的荣誉。
 我只想说，这一切都是大量工作的结果，主要是因为在您任期之初，很多职位都空缺。
 有时，你是某些地方唯一的人，你必须应对即将发生的事情并稳定该地区。
 所有这些稳定似乎还有很长的路要走。
 是的，我们做到了。
 这就是这次会议和所有这些美好事物的目的。
 但在幕后，真正稳定该地区所需要的是
 比你可以放在幻灯片上的更大的东西。
 这似乎太遥远了，我认为你在评论中没有公正地对待它。
 但我很高兴它在后视镜里。

 正如鲁索议员所说，现场非常非常拥挤。
 当我思考这个问题时，我想到了那次会议，我们很快就必须任命一名临时官员，我们围着桌子问，我们要寻找什么？
 有些人说，当我们过渡到新的领导层时，会保持一致性。
 有人说他有能力改变事情。
 有了新的领导层，我认为这确实反映了这两部分，我很欣赏我们在这里看到的平衡，但不仅仅是平衡，好吧，这些是正确的比例，我们已经解决了这个问题，让我们继续前进。
 它反映了许多正在进行的重新评估，这正是我们所需要的，不仅仅是在实地、在特定情况下，而且实际上，我们作为一个地区现在处于什么位置？
 所以我真的很感激。
 我有一个小问题，是卢索成员提出的后续问题。
 所以我认为思考这个问题很重要。
 我认为思考这一点很重要。
 我认为思考这一点很重要。
 保证这件事已经发生，这些就是协议及其周围的清晰度。
 因此，我认为在这里交流这是一个非常困难的话题，但了解那里的领导方法很有用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4813.631s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 100%，我认为这个演示文稿的很多内容可以来自地区安全委员会正在做的工作。
 我们从团队成员那里听到了许多作品。
 具体来说，它是关于与“我爱你们”协议相关的专业发展水平或缺乏。
 所以这实际上是洛德先生议程上的优先事项之一。
 我认为他们我们在今天的会议上稍微讨论了这个问题，以便在学校层面，他们可以讨论围绕该协议的培训和重新定义期望。
 所以，是的，出于安全原因，我们不想与社区分享某些内容，但我认为这些区级会议所关注和工作的进展是可以 100% 共享的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4878.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 谢谢。
 然后我认为有一个缺失的部分，我认为你没有提到它，但雇用了一名运输经理。
 我真的很欣赏你们如何看待员工和从事多项工作的人以及如何更好地分配这些工作。
 你在中央领导层谈到了这一点，但我认为在其他层面也存在这种情况。
 哦是的。
 我注意到了这一点并想对此发表评论。
 谢谢你。
 所以我要得出结论，因为我知道其他人有话要说，看到这些行动项目和进展情况，我认为确实有助于确定我们作为下一个任期的委员会需要什么报告，我们希望看到什么，我们需要什么决议
 我们一起工作，所以我认为您在开始时对合作伙伴关系的评论非常感谢，我会向您反映这一点，因为这对于了解幕前和幕后发生的事情确实很有帮助，所以感谢您抽出时间。
 我知道这可能需要很长时间才能将这里的所有其他内容放在一起，所以非常感谢您。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4950.968s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4952.009s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢赖因菲尔德-阿拉奇众议员，我想我们有奥拉帕德众议员和普罗克斯众议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4962.113s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 谢谢。
 我知道我的委员会成员已经提到过这一点，但这令人印象深刻。
 我想你这么长时间以来一直保持专注，关注所有这些无数不同的话题。
 我想给你们一点掌声。
 我有几个问题，但我想尽快回答，因为我知道其他成员仍然想去。
 所以我知道我的其他一些成员正在谈论健康和人文课程审查。
 谁负责对此的审查过程？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4997.816s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 好吧，金·塔尔博特博士是体育部的助理总监，正在休假，以进行学习和指导。
 新标题有了，对吗？
 她将帮助领导这项工作，但体育和健康主管是雷切尔·佩里，所以他们将共同领导这项工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5023.072s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 太好了，谢谢。
 我也不知道那是什么幻灯片。
 我认为这是用于教育决策的改进数据系统。
 您说过，您将通过这种新型分析平台等收集的此类数据将被实时用于就指令和其他一切提供建议。
 我想，您能否举例说明您希望如何实现这一点或它是如何实施的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5057.953s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 当然，你在说话吗？对不起，Lachi，因为对于供暖系统，我想确保我没有听错。
 你在谈论开放建筑师吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5065.538s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 是的，我只记得你说过，或者在我的笔记中，其中一些数据将被实时使用。
 这引起了我的注意，所以我想知道你是否可以举个例子。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5076.184s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 当然，绝对。
 因此，实际时间不一定是
 在课堂上。
 可能是。
 但实时部分是我们不必等待单元结束时的评估。
 我们不需要等待年中、年初和年底的大基准。
 实时意味着教师将通过使用这些面板、Hill for Literacy 以及这个开放架构师平台获得数据，
 他们经常使用这些信息，并且可以为他们的日常或每周的计划和指导提供信息。
 因此，当您计划一周、一天时，您可以使用不同的数据模式。
 其中一些也是教师收集的数据，只是为了
 学生的反应（仅通过出口票）表明，教师有无数种方式使用他们可以实时带来的数据，这将影响他们的计划和教学。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5151.117s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 您是否更多地在班级层面上想象这一点，在这些老师看到这些数据的情况下，您知道，可以建议他们在课程中需要花更多时间的地方，或者是在特定的学生层面上，他们可以看到学生正在挣扎，想要提供帮助，或者两者兼而有之？
 就像……以上所有。
 出色的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5170.553s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 所以是在学生层面，在班级层面，在院系层面，在年级层面，在学校层面。
 所有这一切的发生是因为教师单独工作以确保满足学生的需求，但他们也与同事一起处理年级或部门级数据，学校领导和部门领导与教师进行更大规模的合作。
 它确实适合所有级别。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5203.812s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 太棒了，从教师和教育者的角度来看，这听起来很棒。
 先生，我对 DIBELS 感到抱歉，这张幻灯片上有太多内容。
 您刚才说，历史上他们帮助过地区教育工作者。
 所以这和你说的很像？
 使用系统数据来指导您的学习计划。
 啊，迪布斯，谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5234.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 迪布尔，是的。
 谢谢。
 是的，DIBLS 用于评估学生的阅读水平和能力。
 所以看起来不一样。
 K 到 2 岁，就像 3 岁到 5 岁一样，看起来也有所不同，具体取决于每个学生及其独立阅读水平。
 Dibbles 被视为基准和进度跟踪器。
 因此，作为参考，在年初、年中、年末送给每个学生。
 这是以某种方式跟踪的，并且是用于报告的数据。
 但有些学生需要进度监控。
 并非每个人都这样做，但低于年级的学生需要监控他们的进度。
 有些学生可能需要受到监控。
 每两周一次，每四个星期一次。
 其他学生只能每六到八周来一次，所以这取决于需要的程度。
 所以这个迪布尔斯是一个快速评估，持续一分钟。
 这也用于跟踪进度，以便教师可以在这些时间间隔内跟踪进度、成长情况，以便他们能够真正专注于自己的目标。
 您的指示。
 我们使用的 Hill for Literacy 平台（称为 Continuum）的惊人之处在于，所有这些数据都放入该平台中。
 教师不仅可以访问数据，还可以帮助他们为特定学生提供教学重点。
 所以老师在学生层面上有这个。
 然后，他们可以使用这些数据根据学生的需求对学生进行分组，并在小组时间内真正集中精力进行教学。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5345.573s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢。
 抱歉，还有一张。
 如果您从一开始就不知道，那也没关系，但是与以前的系统相比，开放架构师的货币成本概况是多少，或者这是否是一种新型……这是一个非常好的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5369.05s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 首先，我想开始只是因为你问到了 Dibbles，我认为 Dibbles 很重要，因为 Dibbles 每个学生只需花费一美元。
 实际上你只需为平台付费，所以非常非常非常经济。
 开放建筑师，七个？
 哦，20。
 20,000 美元用于全区范围内的访问。
 因此，所有员工、所有教育工作者、教师和管理人员都可以访问该平台。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5402.482s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 明白了。
 谢谢。
 再说一次，这令人印象深刻。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5406.845s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢埃拉奇。
 谢谢。
 Lopare 会员，Parques 会员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5413.51s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 谢谢。
 我只是想说我是多么感激它，我想，
 您给我们提供了完整而深入的解释。
 我认为您在很短的时间内涵盖了很多内容。
 自从你上任或执政以来，我非常欣赏的是集体归属感。
 我认为这突出了您在这里详细介绍的很多内容。
 我认为关于沟通和伙伴关系的对话，包括护理人员的参与，非常重要。
 近几个月来，我公开接触过的许多家长都直言不讳地表达了他们在学生放学回家时看到的兴奋之情。
 认识到由于生活成本（例如日程安排困难），成为一名充分参与的家长变得越来越困难。
 因此，我们经常每天送学生去学校，并且没有像我们希望的那样投入。
 我认为，正如您所提到的，沟通的增加总是有改进的空间，我认为这对公众和广大学生群体来说有很大的好处，可以更多地了解正在发生的事情。
 我想我只是希望能够认识到，当我们进入下一个学校的剩余两个学期或季度，然后进入下一个学年时，归属感就是保持这种归属感。
 我认为您确实强调了这一点，所以我只想对此表示感谢。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5492.468s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢奥拉帕德众议员。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5497.068s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: 谢谢。
 已经做了很多工作，我将在更长的时间内密切关注一切。
 我在这方面学到了很多东西。
 然而，我的问题之一是如何收集反馈。
 我知道这一点已经被提及很多次了。
 你知道，有些事情进展顺利，有些事情进展得不太顺利，也许是时间表，甚至你如何收集有关开放建筑师或其他一些专业发展计划的反馈，并了解他们是否在工作，或者人们是否接受他们，或者他们是否是学生、教师或任何人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5532.189s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 这是一个很好的问题。
 哦，我不在麦克风附近。
 这是一个很好的问题。
 我会说有
 当我们开会、进行专业发展时，总会有通行证。
 我们确实正在使用这些数据来构建和完善下一次会议，而且我们是非常有意的。
 关于我们在改变做事方式时如何尊重反馈。
 我认为我们做了很多研究。
 我认为这反映了我目前对如何收集数据的一些看法。
 您知道，我们收到了调查回复，但它们并不总能体现梅德福的全部精髓。
 这对我们来说是持续的工作。
 始终还有一定程度的街道数据。
 所以当你遇到人的时候
 当我在旅行中遇到人们时，当我们参观学校时，当我们参加会议时，这种程度的反馈也会发生。
 作为一个领导团队，一个核心领导团队，我们一直在做的事情之一就是尝试创建登陆页面和电子表格。
 为我们提供输入这些数据的机会。
 主要是塔尔博特博士和我，我们有一个这样的地方，这样当我们听到这些事情或出现一些事情时，我们就有一个地方可以记录下来，这样我们就可以回来。
 与管理层所做的或喜欢创建着陆空间非常相似，这样人们就知道可以去哪里获取一些信息。
 但我想说，其中一部分也是我们正在进行的工作。
 我认为即将举行的论坛是另一个收集人们真实反馈和贡献的地方。
 我知道还会发出一份调查问卷，但我在见面会期间收集了很多非常重要的数据。
 当我们参加委员会和工作组时。
 但同样，这只是我们确保每个人都发出声音的一部分。
 这就是仍然需要完成的工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5703.254s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5711.998s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: 谢谢。
 简而言之，警长。
 对我来说这是一次很棒的第一次会议，我真的很高兴能够了解你们，尤其是领导团队一直在做的所有工作。
 三件事引起了我的注意： 很明显，正在进行许多组织变革和改进。
 这是一项艰苦的工作，需要花费很多时间，而且真的很高兴看到。
 这在你想与我们分享的作品中得到了很好的体现。
 其次，支持课程开发的想法，帮助我们的教育工作者不必花时间开发课程，而是真正关注他们如何呈现课程并尝试建立这种联系。
 这才是真正的力量倍增器。
 再说一次，我真的很想赞扬你和你的团队。
 这是一件奇妙的事情。
 最后，我最关心的是社区学校。
 这是一个社区资源。
 作为这些地方的管理者和管理者，我认为我们必须在代际公平之间找到平衡
 让您现在能够为用户提供支持，并能够在未来（10 年、20 年、30 年）为用户维护这些资产。
 因此，我很高兴看到您的团队为我们带来了哪些内容，以讨论社区学校的未来。
 但非常感谢您的介绍。</p>

 就在我们离开这个主题之前，我想确保我们向社区明确在主管评估方面的下一步是什么。
 所以我会让奥拉帕德成员告诉我们这一点。
 但我猜我的问题。
 同样，出于围绕 MSBA 问题的类似规划目的，我们是否仍有望在 26 日的会议上进行评估并共同审查？
 您需要这个委员会的帮助吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5839.358s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 这是一个很好的问题。
 这将传达给与我们交谈的成员。
 所以我是 Tapa 论坛的成员。
 我是布兰利论坛的成员。
 不是最新的委员会成员。
 该报告将于明天早上发布，以便我们每个人在收到主管的评估后，可以整理我们的想法和愿望，让社区为人所知。
 然后我将获取这些数据并将其编译成简洁的消息。
 我想向公众明确表示，我将阅读的内容是所有想法和观点分析的结合，
 成员是在上次会议上确定的，因此实际上不会由每个成员决定，除非成员觉得需要说些什么，但通常这不是标准或不是我们遵循的模型，但到 26 日就会准备好。
 我认为这是会议</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5896.888s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 如果你允许我从椅子上站起来，只是去拿它，我们明天早上就会收到它，然后我们什么时候把它交给我们来取呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5903.552s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 最好是在周日之前拿到，18号周日？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5911.176s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5912.096s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 是的，这给了我大约一周的时间来收集所有信息。
 我不想进一步追问，因为我们希望在 MSBA 采取下一步行动之前公开完成这项审查。</p>

 我很想知道，因为你提到了如何加强现有的沟通方式，尤其是与父母的沟通方式。
 我想知道在沟通多元化方面做了哪些工作，特别是因为我很好奇，所以我上网查了一下，学校网站之外确实没有太多前瞻性的沟通。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5961.114s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 这是一个很好的问题。

 我们不断更新我们的网站，以确保为社区中的家庭提供尽可能最好的信息。
 当我们发送一些东西时，我们就是在发送我们的通信。

 但这是一个问题，我的意思是，你知道，
 随着报纸的终结，每个人都无处可去。
 就好像如果你去 Facebook，Medford Politics 有 2,000 人，其中大多数可能住在梅德福。
 他们可以相信，当他们在那里时，他们正在与梅德福进行交流，并且他们正在与来自梅德福的某些东西进行交流。
 我认为这是一个挑战，我认为城市的整个部门除了敲门或邮寄东西之外没有其他沟通方式。
 显然，两者都非常昂贵。
 我认为我们发现自己陷入了一个悲伤的境地，尤其是当我们谈论一所新高中时。
 当我们谈论一所新高中时，你知道，我们无法在报纸上发表专栏文章并认为我们正在影响大多数选民。
 因此，这是我们这个时代真正的挑战。
 我并不羡慕我们的通讯团队。
 谢谢你提出这个问题。
 这非常重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6126.908s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢你，鲁索议员。
 再次感谢加鲁西博士。
 以下是我们批准 26-27 学年学区日历的建议。
 我会把它转达给你，Galusi 博士。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6141.815s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 所以我不知道，皮皮切利先生，你呢？
 他太好了。
 谢谢。
 所以我们花了一些时间讨论明年的日历。
 我们在这里提出的建议是明年学校日历的这个选项。
 在制定 26-27 学年的计划时，需要牢记以下几点： 劳动节早就该到来了。
 正如您在此处看到的，劳动节是 9 月 7 日，这意味着根据合同，
 前一周返回学校。
 事实上，这是明年九月的第一周。
 通常在一年中，返回周是八月的最后一周。
 明年，这将是九月的第一周。
 此外，初选投票日为 9 月 1 日星期二。
 因此，我们在这里提供的只是建议，遵循与今年几乎相同的结构，让教师回来参加他们的专业发展日，于 8 月 31 日星期一和 9 月 1 日启动，并于 9 月 2 日欢迎一年级至 12 年级的学生回来。
 这确实，
 无雪天，6 月 23 日是学校的最后一天。
 因此，如果有下雪天，我们必须在 6 月 23 日之后添加。
 正如我们已经讨论过的那样，我也希望保持非常透明的态度。
 去年推出日历时，因为一些假期的原因，
 有人建议出于宗教目的纪念重大节日，但我不想少说，但由于缺乏更好的词，它们并不是值得庆祝的重要圣日。
 我们明年将采取类似的方法。
 但我想指出，从历史上看，直到今年，梅德福公立学校都有耶稣受难日放假。
 这是第一年。
 这是上学日，不是休息日。
 因此，明年拟议的日历也包括耶稣受难日作为上学日。
 我希望我们一切都好，但我们也不在那儿。
 正如我那天所经历的那样。
 所以我希望我们不会因为人事问题而受到阻碍。
 我只是想对正在提议的这个日历这一事实保持完全透明，但在我们看到今年这一天发生的情况后，可能需要在某个时候进行更多对话。
 除此之外，唯一的部分是 DESI 对何时毕业以及高中毕业与学区最后一天上学之间的距离有规定。
 而且人数不能超过 12 人。
 这意味着明年 2027 届毕业生最早可能于 6 月 4 日星期五毕业。
 因此，根据 DESI 规定，我们必须将其从周三移至周五。
 除此之外，我们实际上遵循了与今年相同的结构。
 在联合工作期间与教学工会对此进行了审查。
 今天我与工会主席安东尼·吉伦进行了交谈。
 而且这个选项完全符合集体协议，所以他们当然支持。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6405.45s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 我很乐意回答任何问题。
 谢谢你，博士。
 我想今天我们读到他们想再举行一次评论会议。
 那么您是要求投票来提交该表格还是寻求批准？
 不，我正在寻求批准。
 出色地。
 我进行了一次交谈。
 卢索成员，后来是格雷厄姆成员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6426.085s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 我只想说，我们在2020年批准了这项政策，这是日历准确呈现的第一年，所以我想说谢谢。
 这实际上不是一件容易的事，因为你说，你知道，我想查看 2026 年的日期，就像，哦，但我需要其中一些日期为 2027 年，但对于 9 月 1 日之后的日期需要 2026 年，所以有点，
 有时乏味且令人困惑。
 我接受我们的政策，接受提议的日历，并对其进行审查，你知道，我会询问 GPT Chat 那一年的日期是什么时候。
 就连我，在经历了这一切之后，也犯了一些错误，差点给你发短信说一切都不好了。
 但我没有这样做，因为我意识到我看错了年份。
 所以我很欣赏这是正确的。
 而且，坦率地说，我的意思是，今年我们非常幸运，因为很多假期都在周六，很多我们不上学的宗教假期都在周六，或者，坦率地说，很多周六和周日。
 所以从学校的角度来看，我们非常幸运。
 去年我们非常不幸。
 所以我很高兴我们不必这样做。
 对此您还有什么想说的吗？
 不，我只是想提出一项动议，批准所提出的选项 A。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6590.903s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Thank you.
 I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.
 So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.
 So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.
 We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.
 But they already were on board and working.
 And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can
 And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?
 So what happens today?
 How does it happen?
 Where is the ledge?
 Where is the playing field?
 How does traffic flow?
 Where are the challenges?
 And all of that good stuff.
 So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to
 And I think that's a really good question.
 I think that's a really good question.
 And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.
 So they've been doing all of that work.
 They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.
 So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.
 They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.
 There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.
 All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.
 At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.
 That work has been really interesting to watch.
 So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.
 So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.
 And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.
 And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.
 What do you do?
 How do you do it?
 Where do you do it?
 All of that good stuff.
 So all of that happened.
 That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.
 Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.
 So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?
 So it's very educationally focused.
 It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having
 grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.
 So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.
 It started with a shadow day and
 Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.
 Arrival, lunch, passing periods.
 like all of it.
 Right.
 So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.
 He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.
 I think they saw four schools in a day.
 Is that right.
 To help our team understand what's possible.
 Right.
 Because many people
 have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.
 So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.
 So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.
 Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,
 and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.
 And I got to be part of that two-day session.
 And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.
 And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.
 And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.
 So he was super skillful and artful.
 just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.
 So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.
 So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like
 The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.
 what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?
 And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.
 And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.
 But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate
 What are we going to do in the building?
 And how are we going to do it?
 And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.
 And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.
 Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?
 And is it an open space or a closed space?
 That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is
 a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.
 Like why do you need a new space, right?
 So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.
 And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.
 And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.
 And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.
 And then we have this set of sessions.
 And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?
 And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.
 And
 She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.
 And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.
 And we're like, fair, right?
 Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.
 But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.
 And we were like, why?
 Why wouldn't you do it there?
 And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.
 And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,
 maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.
 Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?
 I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?
 Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?
 And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,
 like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say
 do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?
 And the answer is like, absolutely not.
 Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.
 So out of all of that will come an educational plan.
 And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.
 So we'll be introducing it then.
 So SMMA will be here with us.
 We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.
 But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,
 is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.
 Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.
 And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.
 So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.
 Preliminary design plan.
 And that PDP includes the educational plan.
 That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.
 And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space
 concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.
 That work is for the building committee to do.
 So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.
 But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.
 So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.
 And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from
 Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.
 The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.
 Where will the building go and what will it look like?
 Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?
 So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.
 So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.
 so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?
 So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.
 And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.
 lots of chances for community input in those sessions.
 So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.
 And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.
 So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.
 Translation services will be available.
 We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.
 They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks
 Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.
 And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.
 We'll collect a lot of questions.
 We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.
 And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.
 And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.
 And there'll be a place for public input.
 And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.
 We're working on plans for that.
 Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.
 So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.
 And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?
 Like the building could be here, it could be there.
 That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.
 So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?
 How many classrooms is it?
 that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,
 And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.
 That's why the ed plan is so important.
 So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.
 And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.
 And that's false.
 It's almost completely false.
 I think there's one program where that is true.
 And it's like a marginal change.
 In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.
 So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.
 It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan
 is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?
 One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.
 They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.
 And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.
 What's the other one?
 Fitness center.
 So, and it's not like marginally bigger.
 What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.
 So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.
 So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think
 part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.
 But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.
 It's been a lot of really not glorious,
 And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not
 the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.
 They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.
 So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.
 But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.
 So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.
 So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.
 Let's see, where'd it go?
 Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.
 I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.
 And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.
 One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.
 And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.
 And to create a higher quality,
 video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.
 None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.
 So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.
 On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.
 This is where we're going to start to see concepts.
 This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.
 And then we will
 Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.
 we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.
 The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.
 We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.
 Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.
 On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.
 On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.
 So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.
 All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.
 There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.
 And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.
 That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.
 By June we will have one.
 So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish
 How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?
 So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.
 But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.
 Tell us what you think about them.
 So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.
 And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.
 where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.
 So that's the next three months of this project.
 So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?
 No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.
 and cost.
 So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.
 We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized
 doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.
 There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.
 There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.
 But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.
 So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.
 But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8120.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 赖因菲尔德议员。
 谢谢。
 这太令人兴奋了。
 是的，终于。
 是的。
 我对此感到非常兴奋。
 好吧，我的第一个问题是：我们可以从愿景会议中借用一些东西来用于我们的战略规划会议吗？
 因为这听起来很棒。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8136.725s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 真是太棒了。
 我认为房间里的一些人说，我们需要与所有高中老师一起这样做。
 因此，围绕可能发生的事情有很多能量。
 我认为迈克的认可之一，
 谁是该组织的负责人，他说，当你听到有关学校建造了一些东西然后不使用它的故事时，你知道，对吗？
 你总是听到这个。
 他说发生这种情况是因为
 人们列出他们的希望、梦想和愿望。
 他们说：“如果我们能拥有这些东西那就太好了。”
 然后每个人都关闭希望、梦想和渴望的清单，等待大楼的到来。
 以及一种希望这座建筑能够改变他们。
 而这座大楼不会这样做。
 变革必须发生在人身上，因为人才是真正需要改变的人，对吗？
 所以我们聊了一些
 在我们制定初始教育计划后，应该提供哪些类型的专业发展机会和协作会议才能真正开始协作发展？
 在这座大楼开放之前我们能做什么？
 我们什么时候可以做这些事情？
 以及需要什么支持。
 这也是这个教育规划团队所做的另一项工作。
 我当然说过：“我很乐意给你建议。”
 我很乐意告诉您如何自己做。
 我很乐意帮助您做到这一点。
 但是，是的，我认为这很切中要点，就像他所做的工作一样，让每个人都迷惑了他们认为自己要告诉我们的事情，
 这很重要，而且是一项需要技巧的工作，所以我认为认真考虑接下来的步骤很重要。
 我认为我们将在战略规划会议中使用很多相同的技术，尽管我们的受众控制会稍微少一些，所以我们将对此进行导航。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8273.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 那真是太治愈了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8275.047s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，是的。
 是的，我认为当你拥有精心策划的受众时，你就可以真正发挥领导作用，我们也会尝试在两个小时内完成我们的战略规划会议。
 我们有两天时间。
 因此，我们的行为必须略有不同，但许多相同的相似概念肯定会适用。
 是的，我希望有一种方法可以让人们捕捉到它并以某种方式在小插图中分享它。是的，我认为对你来说，我们可以谈论的一件事是我们如何捕捉到这一点，因为我认为这确实是
 发生的事情很酷，我想也许有机会我们可以讨论一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8311.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我只是觉得我的孩子不喜欢这个，但从今天起我就一直收到消息。但学校里比外面冷，有一天我教一位建筑师如何编法式辫子。
 所以，看到这个学生全神贯注真是太好了。
 所以我认为我现在的大多数其他问题都与与社区的沟通有关。
 事实上，我真的很高兴西蒙提出了这个想法，即向学校社区以外的人伸出援手的问题。
 我们有很多策略来做到这一点，我很乐意这样做。
 我很乐意在论坛上发布这些信息，无论是通过讨论点还是通过学校的电子邮件。
 我知道这不一定适用于整个梅德福社区，但我在想，我正在看观众席上的所有小学校长，但这些是住在这栋大楼和高中的学生。
 因此，如果能在周三之前发出该通知，那就太好了，但我想知道我们是否可以在那段时间制作某种带有免责声明的背包传单，具体取决于新英格兰的天气等情况，以下是如何注册的方法，如果有时事通讯发布，以下是如何随时了解该项目的信息，如果我们能尽快向家庭提供一些实际的东西，那真的会是</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8399.811s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，那里也正在酝酿一些事情。
 我们会向您发送提醒。
 威尔联系了市长办公室的史蒂夫，告知他这次会议的情况。
 出色的。
 社区联络员将向需要翻译服务的社区通报本次会议。
 在我们谈论重要日期的同时，我们今天与社区代表讨论的另一件事是如何向人们提供即将发生的事情的确切列表。
 所以，当我们把它们放在一起时，我们可以用它做很多事情，包括塞一些传单和背包。
 因此，关于会议的沟通是通过两种不同的方式进行的。
 我们会向您发送提醒，然后我们可以这样说，
 就像“面包屑的踪迹”一样，这是一种针对我们小学生的背包聚会计划，也可以通过所有这些渠道将其传播出去。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8457.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 因为我认为通过学校实现这一目标可以让我们的一些家庭参与进来
 恕我直言，他们可能不会那么严格地遵循每周备忘录。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8466.62s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的。
 我认为我们要讨论的另一件事是如何创建一个电子邮件列表时事通讯，可用于学校社区之外更广泛的沟通，以便社区中希望收到有关建筑委员会事务的明确通知的人们可以这样做。
 所以我们有很多面向沟通的东西
 我们将开始向前迈进，以便能够建立一个更大的知情人士基础。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8496.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 出色的。
 我想我的最后一个问题就是关于这个的。
 我知道当你开始的时候有一个沟通和社区参与小组委员会，我们只是想确保它保持活跃和强大。
 如果这个身体有什么知道的话
 好一半的人，嗯，这个房间里这个委员会的人比没有的人要多。
 他曾在萨默维尔的多个建筑委员会任职，并且是一名设施项目经理。
 我想我是这里唯一不参与建设的人。
 但我们可以尽一切努力支持该委员会宣传这一信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8530.081s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的。
 这个小组委员会已经有一段时间没有开会了，因为我们所有的工作都集中在现有条件上。
 但我认为有机会让这个团队重新团结起来，我将与该团队的成员讨论做一些可以发布的事情，比如每月通讯或可以由建筑委员会的一部分撰写的东西。
 所以我们会讨论它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8554.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 那太好了。
 我的目标是，当债务取消赎回权出现时，没有人会感到惊讶。
 哦，绝对是。
 对不起。
 公平点。
 我们将努力争取全部。
 或者当他们惊讶地知道去哪里寻找更多信息时。
 感谢您所做的所有工作。
 感谢所有完成这项工作的人，因为我知道工作量很大。
 我很兴奋。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8582.266s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 你必须说几句话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8589.509s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 再次感谢您，Simón Alcindor，地址：Rua Tainter 44。
 我只是有几个简单的问题。
 首先，我知道您在谈到这个项目的探索阶段时，简单地提到了交通。
 由于这是一个有点偏僻的地方，您是否有更多关于他们到底在做什么的细节，特别是在交通方面？
 我对此有点感兴趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8612.321s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，这是通过两种不同的方式实现的。
 除了我所说的一切之外，我忘记提及我们有四个咨询委员会。
 四个委员会中约有 70 人正在讨论谁是加入我们并担任特定角色的社区成员。
 其中一个小组委员会负责网站安全。
 假期前的那次会议上提到了交通问题。
 所以我们关于交通的对话有几件事。
 一是关于我们学校所在地的单向性质。
 说到这一点，我们从代表，特别是代表那里听到，紧急通道是我们需要探索的东西，团队正在讨论它。
 我们还讨论在建筑物周围创造更好的交通流量，无论它位于何处。
 所以建筑师评论的一件事是
 现在该物业的布局方式优先考虑停车而非流量。
 我们遇到的许多问题都可以通过关注房产周围的人流来缓解。
 在我们的愿景会议中出现的例子是学生们说：
 我试着提前几分钟下完最后一堂课，因为我必须赶公共汽车，而且公共汽车在教学楼的另一边，如果我没有到达那里，我就找不到座位，或者因为已经满了而无法上车，对吗？
 他们说，事实上，这是同一件事，每个人都从同一个出口离开，对吧？
 所以，如果你被汽车撞到，如果你被公共汽车撞到，如果你步行回家，每个人都会从同一个出口离开。
 太疯狂了，对吧？
 然后他们说：公共汽车可以在其他地方吗？
 学生们就是这么问的。
 我们可以把公共汽车放在其他地方吗？
 我们目前的房产的答案是否定的。
 但在一座新大楼里，我们想，人们如何到达这所学校？
 好像他们是步行到达的。
 事实上，这里的地形非常陡峭，对吧？
 所以如果你骑自行车去，那座山上的路段相当陡峭。
 我不是骑自行车的人，但我做不到。
 那么我们到底能吓倒多少人呢？
 因为有一个非常明显的音调，对此有反应吗？
 而且，我们如何才能确保我们不会陷入同一个瓶颈，本质上就是今天所发生的情况？
 因此，所有这些都在讨论中，甚至出现了一些问题，比如我们可能需要与 MBTA 讨论公交车时刻表，以及是否可以进行任何更改以创造更好的交通。
 你知道，当你开始谈论这种事情时，学生们会正确地说没有晚点的公共汽车。
 因此，如果我尝试，一名学生告诉我，我会努力留下来，而不是放学后留下来，因为如果我放学后留下来，我将不得不步行两英里回家。
 我需要一个小时。
 然后因为没有晚点的公共汽车。
 所以，在这些会议中，出现了很多不必要的事情，比如公共汽车迟到了，这与这座建筑是旧的还是新的无关，而是在我们需要解决的集体问题的背景下出现的。
 所以，是的，有很多关于交通的讨论，我很高兴看到它是如何流动的。
 每次我到达那个急转弯的后角时，我都会想：
 这是谁干的？
 为什么这么紧？
 我几乎无法将我的巨型汽车移到那里，更不用说两辆车了。
 就是这样的事情。
 所以，如果你考虑一下你是否要......
 他这样做，他这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8850.138s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: 这些巴士飞镖可以创造奇迹。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8852.42s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但如果你绕到大楼后面去把孩子送到田野里，你就必须掉头按原来的路走。
 因此，当我们开始讨论如何设计这座新建筑时，我真的希望这种自由的对话能够得到显着改善。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8874.665s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 另外，委员会会议是否会根据该市的活动日历等举行？
 是的。
 因为我意识到它们是，至少不是星期三，对吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8886.248s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 还没有。
 这是一项正在进行的工作。
 然后假期就这样过去了。
 威尔将所有这些事情都放在了 MPS 日历上，并与市政府分享，以便他们也能参与其中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8897.411s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8898.192s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的。
