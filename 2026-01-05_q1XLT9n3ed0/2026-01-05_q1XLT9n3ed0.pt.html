    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=299.602s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  Thank you.
 Good evening.
 So over the past year, I've been deeply honored to serve the Medford Public Schools community and to lead the district through a period of rebuilding, renewal, and forward momentum.
 This has been a truly busy year, but it's been a really meaningful year, focused on restoring clarity, strengthening systems, and laying the foundation for long-term improvement.
 always centered in a deep commitment in Medford students, educators, families, and community.
 My belief in this community and what our schools can achieve together remains unwavering and I am profoundly grateful for the trust that you all placed in me during this pivotal time.
 None of this progress would have been possible without the extraordinary dedication of our staff, our administrators, our educators, central leadership, and just all of Medford Public Schools staff.
 A strong partnership exists throughout the district and it is in service of students and families.
 This work is very demanding and it is very complex.
 and it keeps you on your toes.
 And it often requires a lot of difficult decisions, long hours and sustained focus.
 And it is work that you take home with you.
 Yet it is carried out.
 in everyday professionalism, care, and an unwavering belief in our students.
 I'm incredibly proud of the countless ways that our staff go above and beyond their formal roles in support of students and families.
 Much of this work happens quietly and without recognition, but it's foundational to what we do here today.
 I'm deeply grateful to the school committee for your support, your guidance, and your partnership throughout this year.
 Your thoughtful questions, your steady leadership, and your shared commitment to Medford students and community have strengthened our work and helped move the district forward.
 I'm also very grateful to our Medford families and community partners for their trust, their collaboration, and their support.
 The partnership has strengthened our decisions and sharpened our vision.
 Because of this collective effort, I'm deeply hopeful about what lies ahead and confident in the foundation that we are building in Medford Public Schools.
 I thank you for letting me just start a little bit that way.
 On the next slide, please.
 What I have laid out here is what I would probably call like more of a state of the schools.
 So this slide just gives a snapshot of this past interim year in review.
 The year started with a little bit of some, as I took over this position, there was a shift in central leadership structure that the previous superintendent had done, and that had me shifting my role, and I was in the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 During that time, we began to work
 a lot on our instructional excellence.
 We were working on creating an instructional vision so that there was a vertical through line throughout the district from kindergarten to postgraduate.
 That work did start in my previous role and continued during this interim role.
 You will see here just a reminder of the work of the instructional vision and the aligned practice, which was aligning to Desi's version of an instructional vision.
 creating an equity statement that grounds our work each and every day, and the creation of core values.
 It also included bringing in professional development to make sure that our staff was aligned in this work.
 As I took over, I created a transitional plan that I presented to this body about a month ago.
 This spoke about the work that I had done really working on
 the meet and greets, listening to the community, listening to the staff, trying to get a better understanding, even though my whole career has been here for 29 years, that shift in roles, I wanted to make sure that I was providing another opportunity for input and learning.
 All of that to bring with me to this position.
 If we could please go to the next slide.
 This presentation right here on this slide, I am organizing my self-evaluation in the work that we have done this past year.
 So this work is going to be highlighted in four buckets.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the work that I have done collectively with staff and with the community to create stability through shared purpose and vision.
 I am going to highlight the work of building instructional excellence
 through leadership and coherence, which is a lot of the instructional work.
 I'm also going to talk about strengthening operational foundations of Medford Public Schools and the communication and partnership.
 So to begin, our core values
 were created while I was in this position as interim superintendent.
 They evolved in a lot of the work that started previously to this interim position and then really came full circle at the end of last year through that work and the coalescing that we did as an administrative team during our retreat.
 These core values came from the work of the instructional vision.
 So there is collaborative effort.
 and input put into the core values.
 Next slide, please.
 Our core values are we believe all students deserve to feel seen, heard, valued, and connected in schools where inclusive, culturally affirming practices allow them to grow, succeed, and fully engage in their learning.
 We believe all students deserve the opportunities, resources, and support they need to reach their full potential.
 And we believe every student's success is our shared responsibility.
 So the pivotal piece first of this work was really to restore clarity.
 Who are we?
 How do we lead?
 What we expect?
 And how do we communicate?
 Next slide, please.
 So first I'm going to discuss stability through shared purpose and vision.
 When I stepped into the interim superintendent role,
 a year ago, January 2025, I knew immediately that my first responsibility was to restore a little bit of stability and coherence and a sense of shared purpose across the district.
 Medford is a system with considerable strengths, but it was also operating with fragmented structures.
 uneven expectations, inconsistent communication patterns, and operational pressures that demanded clear leadership and alignment.
 My earliest work centered on creating clarity, clarity of purpose, clarity of expectations, and clarity in how we were going to move forward together.
 That was the work that really began.
 It's work that's been ongoing, but really fully began over the summer.
 When we brought in a new leadership team, we were able to coalesce around our shared purpose, our core values, and grounding the district in belonging.
 Belonging as the foundational lens for all decisions.
 This slide talks about that.
 I've shared this before in many presentations, I feel like, this year, but just to make a point here that part of establishing that clear vision was grounding us all in this central purpose this year, and that was belonging.
 It guides our instructional coherence and grade-level expectations, data-informed practices, and strengthening classroom experiences across the system.
 and belonging frames everything from academic discourse to grade level instruction tasks to culturally affirming practices and the rollout of consistent expectations across classrooms.
 I will be highlighting that work as this presentation evolves.
 It also really came forward in the intentional elevation of student voice.
 This is something that is
 still growing.
 This is something that we are making sure that we're including when we gather together in spaces.
 It is the intentional inclusion of the Mustang moment in our agenda, which I also will highlight a little bit further in this presentation, but making sure that we are embedding student perspectives during our leadership retreats.
 We had student perspectives on our first day of school, our first opening for staff.
 They spoke at the convocation and really spoke about what belonging means to them and why and what they want their teachers to hear about why it's important.
 We have student voice in our Mustang moment and we start every school committee meeting that way, so it reminds us as to our why, our collective reason why we're here.
 We want to make sure we are continuing to provide opportunities so that students are able to speak and lead and inform our practice.
 I want to extend that just a little bit on an example here where I feel that this kind of aligns all of the work in one perfect example.
 This year we've done a lot of work, which this body has presented on before, but we had a pretty successful
 negotiations with the teachers.
 And that brought, we had that wonderful opportunity because also of the override.
 And that brought an increased ability and opportunity for us to really be looking at how we're structuring learning every day for students and what that schedule would look like.
 And part of the alignment of a new middle school schedule provided lots of additional instructional time for students, but it also provided an opportunity for making sure we can target students' needs, whether that's remediation, whether that's acceleration, whether that's enrichment, or all of the above.
 And so having that first level of work to make sure that we are providing students with what we know they deserve,
 That work allowed us to put in a challenge course.
 And so this challenge course provided an opportunity for Director Cieri to bring in a STEM-focused program called Robotics C360.
 And so every middle school student will have a semester where they are grounded in this STEM work.
 This also provided a Mustang moment for us, where students, you got to hear from students their perspective of what that class has meant to them, what they're learning from that class, how some of the students are actually hopeful to really see what the engineering program at CTE looks like now based on this experience that they were able to have.
 It also brought us recognition and a highlight
 from the Secretary of Education, Dr. Tutwiler, and the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Driscoll, who came to visit our schools during STEM week to see what robotics C360 was all about.
 And then in continuation to that, it also provided an opportunity for me to present during the MASC, shared conference between the school committees and school leadership,
 on the program and all of this really highlights the through line of what we're trying to do here in Medford Public Schools.
 Lastly, the leadership reorganization was really critical for Medford Public Schools.
 Bringing in a cohesive central administration, bringing together stronger coordination and accountability to our core functions, bringing in a level of expertise to the role has been so impactful.
 And it is really only been probably a little more than four months.
 So I do think it's important to note we've had a big
 reorganization here in leadership, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
 My historical component of having my whole career here for 29 years, what's really wonderful about the balance of this new team is that they're from outside of Medford Public Schools.
 They're bringing with them years of
 experience and expertise and really able to round out our team in a way that is setting the stage for really great things that are going to happen in Medford Public Schools.
 With that, I was very intentional.
 I am in an interim role, but I always want to do what's best for Medford Public Schools.
 and was very intentional about making sure that these new positions were not tied to my status and that they are permanent for Medford Public Schools.
 So we brought in Dr. Kim Talbot, Assistant Superintendent for Academics and Instruction in
 her permanent position.
 We brought in Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, in a permanent position.
 That's really helped to stabilize the district.
 It's really helped to move a lot of the work forward.
 But they also started mid to late August.
 So we are still in the stages of building
 what we know we need to do.
 A tremendous amount of work has been done in these last four months, but there's still a lot more to do.
 The other pieces, which alludes to what I've been talking about, is improving district-wide systems.
 So a lot of what I've spoken about, Medford has always been a wonderful school district.
 But there are pockets of where we're lacking and where we need some further systems to be in place.
 And so a lot of the work that we are doing, especially now that there is a complete team,
 is working on setting clear systems and structures specifically in operations but also in academics and across the district.
 I also think it's important that in this role, I had been a part of negotiations in my previous role for certain units.
 Now in this role, I've been able to be a part of working with Member Graham and Member Ruseau in all of the bargaining units.
 There was a significant amount of work done last year.
 We're still going with some other units.
 Being there to see a lot of that work come to fruition has been quite rewarding and is setting us off on a great start this school year with new CBAs.
 So, strengthening operational foundations.
 What I'm going to highlight in these next few slides is reinforcing operational expectations across departments.
 For people that do not know, our COO has oversight of facilities, technology, and security.
 Systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance, strengthening safety, and looking at our community schools.
 On the first slide, reinforcing operational expectations across departments was making sure we were establishing clear and calibrated expectations, aligning workflows, and creating predictable systems for communication, for problem solving, and follow through.
 Some of those examples are the MPS Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which Mr. Lord has been working on, and a weekly project facility work order review meeting.
 So that follow-through piece, that documentation piece, is what Ken is really laying the groundwork for.
 in the short time he's been here so far.
 So systematically addressing areas of deferred maintenance.
 This has been a big area for Medford Public Schools.
 This has been part of ongoing conversations.
 Really looking at what the deferred maintenance schedule is, has been, with transparency, understanding, and acknowledging gaps in prior upkeep, and leading the system towards a more productive, sustainable plan.
 Part of that work is the facilities conditioning assessment.
 That work was started prior to Mr. Lord coming.
 The report came as he was here and we were able to really look at what that report entails and it has been woven into our capital plan.
 Heating and roof leaks.
 par for the course in the past year.
 There have been lots of unexpected issues that arise.
 We have seen the majority of them happening around either heating or roof leaks.
 Most recently, we had one over the break in Kids' Corner, our municipal daycare.
 A lot of work went into that to make sure that it was remediated.
 Carpets shampooed, items replaced, and mattresses replaced and ordered.
 To make sure that they got here on time, we had to make sure that they were delivered
 speedily through Amazon.
 And so John McLaughlin, Ken Lord and myself made sure that we went to the post office and picked up those 16 crib mattresses and delivered them to Kids Corner.
 But you just don't know what's going to happen.
 And so part of making sure where our buildings are safe and the upkeep is there, regular maintenance is one of our goals.
 The other piece here is a complete review of code compliance.
 Mr. Lord is working on a review of what needs to be done, what may be lacking, what has already been done so that we make sure we're keeping an annual review of code compliance for our buildings.
 Strengthening safety.
 So this is one of the things we've heard from our staff loud and clear is about safety.
 Implementing modern security systems and establishing consistent trained safety practices so every school committee has secure, predictable environments for students and staff to learn and work with confidence.
 What that has looked like is an update.
 and an increase in the cameras that we have in our buildings, and keyless entry.
 This is work that did begin prior to Mr. Lord arriving, but he has seen it through.
 to mostly fruition.
 We're in the final stages of it, but part of that keyless entry also was work with staff who voiced concerns or input around what the hours should be set for their
 ability to come in and out of work.
 So a lot of that was collaborative conversation.
 School-based and district-level safety committees.
 So those have begun.
 Principals have started school-based safety committees within their schools.
 And Mr. Lord has started a district-wide safety committee comprised of a variation of stakeholders and school leaders.
 And I think he had a meeting today.
 This was something we also heard from staff, especially teachers during joint labor sessions around really wanting more understanding of the I love you guys, which is our security protocol, them wanting some additional training, and all of that is underway.
 It also included an increase in our door monitor expectations and procedures in which there is a script and a handbook of expectations for door monitors.
 And then lastly for operations would be community schools.
 This is an ongoing.
 area of focus and review.
 So you hear the word community schools here in Medford Public Schools.
 That's mostly the rental of our buildings.
 It also sees our summer programming summer fun.
 but making sure that we are clarifying rental and program structures so that our buildings can serve as vibrant community spaces, but also ensuring that student and staff needs are adhered to and that proper care and maintenance is going into our buildings.
 So a review of community schools, both in operation and in finance or budget, has started and is continuing.
 Mr. Lord, myself, and Mr. O'Leary, who is the athletic director and community schools director, have been spending lots of time together working on creating
 a clear process and documentation for what it means to rent our facilities.
 We are guiding on the school committee policy for rentals, but in fairness, we've had to start
 We've put a communication out to vendors and are setting up, in the process of setting up, we've had a couple of them already, meetings with each and every vendor so that we can have a conversation around the school committee policy and expectations moving forward.
 That is an area where it wasn't
 completely streamlined and the system needed additional clarity.
 I think it's important to note that we want to do right by our community partners.
 And for them, some of this came as a surprise.
 So having personal conversations is really key in this area right here.
 So this has started, but I am quite certain it will be ongoing throughout the year.
 Next is our bucket of building instructional excellence through leadership.
 Here I'm going to talk about strengthening grade level access and opportunity, building instructional excellence through leadership, creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning, and enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So as you heard me say earlier our instructional work has really been anchored in a powerful through line.
 That through line is our shared sense of belonging.
 It is making sure that students not only feel that they are seen heard and that they belong in their classroom spaces and in all spaces of their school but it is also a sense of belonging for their academic identities so that they are coming into spaces and they feel that they are
 mathematicians, scientists, writers, readers, that also is a sense of belonging for them.
 So to strengthen coherence, the next few slides are really going to talk about some of the work that
 may have begun prior to Dr. Talbot coming here, and then the work that she has initiated and just powered through.
 So the first is the new schedule that I highlighted a little bit earlier, but I think it was just so
 critical and so impactful to the work that we're doing that I do just want to call it out, even though some people here have heard it before, I do think it's important to note that we increased the school day by 15 minutes for students.
 And that 15 minutes was not used for transitional time.
 It was used for instruction.
 And so at the elementary level, what that meant is more time in tier one.
 more time for a whole group time that teachers can use with their students where students are not pulled for services or other things are not coming up where the teacher can have the entire class for additional time.
 It also makes sure that our multi-tiered system of support
 is implemented and ensuring that our students are getting what they need.
 At the middle school level, I highlighted a little bit, but we went from 45 minute running period time, so no transitional time, to 57 minute periods with transitional time and the implementation of the challenge block and still maintaining a win block, which is what
 individuals need.
 That is very impactful for the work that is happening at middle school and really needed to happen for time on learning.
 And at the high school, finally, we were able to create one coherent schedule merging
 CTE in the vocational schools with the high school schedule so that we are minimizing the barriers that we were unintentionally but creating for our students because we were running on two schedules for one building.
 And so being able to combine that into one set schedule going from a six day rotation at the academic side to a five day
 Monday to Friday schedule and adding a seventh period not only finally merged the two buildings and increased opportunity, but it also provided that additional period for students to take advanced courses.
 dabble in something that they wanted to learn a little bit more of and also provided an opportunity for some students who need to have services and not have it at the expense of an elective or something that they wanted to be able to take.
 So this schedule has allowed us to be able to really work on our core values and what is the learning we want to see in every space throughout the district.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are grounded in grade level curriculum, expectations, and aligned tasks.
 Students have a right and a privilege to make sure that they are educated at grade level standards.
 And that is work that we have started and we are continuing.
 Part of that work is making sure that we are expanding access to high quality instructional materials across the district.
 High quality instructional materials
 make sure that we are aligning our curriculum with not only state standards and Massachusetts standards, but with the rigor and the representation that students deserve and should see in what they're learning.
 Next slide.
 Creating coherence through aligned walkthroughs and professional learning.
 This is work that
 Honestly, maybe started to really happen while I was in my previous role as assistant superintendent, but wasn't able to get to the part and the point that we are right now in bringing in a new team and having a clear alignment of what our goals and vision are.
 We have established district-wide walkthrough rubrics and protocols that are aligned to our instructional vision and at the secondary level gleam so that when school leaders, department leaders, central office leaders are in classrooms, we are all calibrated on what those look-fors are in a district-aligned rubric.
 We are delivering professional development across our schools on this work and we are making sure that we're focusing again on grade level instruction, evidence based practices, academic discourse and culturally responsive practices.
 We want to make sure that when we are in classrooms we are seeing students
 have some cognitive lift here and that they're doing the work.
 We want to see that students are able to share their brilliant voices, think out loud about what they're learning, because that's what they need to make sure that they're truly understanding and learning.
 It's that transfer.
 Part of this professional development is that we have partnered with Lynch Leadership Academy at the secondary level, and they are providing coaching for our secondary leaders.
 And we have the expanded partnership with Hill for Literacy at the elementary level, who this year are doing walk-throughs with, again, school leaders and department leaders on instructional look-fors around literacy and data meeting support.
 The other piece is we are enhancing data systems for instructional decision making.
 So really, I think one of the more profound pieces that I have seen in just the short amount of time with Dr. Talbot is the systems that she has begun to put in place around data.
 and how we should be using data in real time to make instructional shifts, decisions on what is best for our students.
 Really looking at what are those datasets and leveraging planning time that school leaders and department leaders have with teachers.
 So, she has developed and implemented a common K-12 format for data analysis and action planning.
 She meets regularly with school leaders and with department leaders, and this embedded professional development is ongoing.
 She has worked with secondary leaders so that there is coherence between what the school leaders
 and the department leaders are doing with their staff around some of these data sets, especially NWEA map data.
 That ensures that consistency of language and approach for teachers.
 They're not hearing different things when they're in their department meetings with directors and something different when they're in their staff meetings with principals.
 This is ongoing work, but it is laying the groundwork for some very important instructional moves.
 Elementary leaders, this work began, this work has been ongoing for a while.
 But our work with DIBLS as our progress monitoring tool and the use of Hill for Literacy's data platform called Continuum.
 This year is full implementation of progress monitoring.
 And so every single staff member at the elementary level, educator,
 is progress monitoring their students.
 Everyone has a caseload.
 We are making sure that there is frequent and ongoing progress monitoring of literacy skills.
 And the use of Continuum has really helped ground that work for school leaders and department leaders and our literacy coaches as they go from school to school and grade level to grade level.
 Supported data-informed instructional improvement to elevate academic discourse and writing.
 I spoke about this earlier, but just making sure that we're doing in our data
 In our data meetings, we're also making sure we're elevating so that the planning is purposeful for teachers around how can we build in those moments of academic discourse for students so that they're engaging with what they're learning and able to articulate that to their peers and to their teachers.
 Targeted leadership development based on trends emerging from walkthroughs, assessment data, and school level priorities.
 One of this has been some of my favorite.
 I know it was on a previous slide, but Dr. Talbot and I started the year
 twice a week, we spent the mornings going from school to school, walking classrooms.
 And a lot of that conversation that we're able to have with school leaders, many here tonight and I appreciate that very much, those conversations that come out of what the walkthroughs, what we're seeing,
 means a lot and helps that shared alignment and shared purpose, but it also helps, much as we want the students to have that discourse in the classroom, we want our leadership to have the same so that they're bringing that back to their work.
 with teachers in buildings.
 And then finally, Dr. Talbot is getting OpenArchitects across the finish line.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 She's had several meetings with them.
 OpenArchitects is a data analytics platform or dashboard that image in the top is just a quick snapshot of what the dashboard does look like, one of them.
 This is
 a platform that is going to be able to house all of our assessment data.
 So that way, again, teachers and school leaders, department leaders will have at their fingertips a collection of student data that they can really look at to inform their planning and to inform their practice.
 On there, for example, we will make sure that we house.
 MAP, MCAS, DIBLS.
 We also have flexibility to put in there if there are district owned assessment tools that we want to be factored into the type of data that teachers and administrators can use to manipulate and to sort the data so that they're really making intentional planning and instructional decisions.
 And then lastly, advancing curriculum coherence and review.
 So ensuring that our curriculum review process is continuous and anchored to our district core values and state standards.
 We are launching a comprehensive humanities ELA review this year for grades 6 through 12, but really at first with a focus on grades 6 through 8, the middle school years, as our first priority at making sure we are addressing a core HQIM alignment
 Right now, at the secondary level, for people maybe listening that aren't aware, all of our materials are self-created.
 And that is a benefit maybe in some areas or for some.
 But as I previously said, making sure that we are providing students with high quality instructional materials that are aligned to state standards, that provide a level of representation and rigor
 is really critical to making sure that we are setting our students up for future success.
 And then continuing that coordinated review, also on the
 caseload horizon for Dr. Talbot is looking at the health curriculum.
 The state has put out new health standards and so we need to do a review now of how what we currently have aligns to the new state standards.
 Communication and partnership.
 In this next slide, I'm going to talk about consistent, timely, and transparent communication, personal outreach and visible presence, inclusive caregiver engagement, and restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 On this slide first, consistent, timely, transparent communication.
 I feel like communication is probably always forever a goal.
 It's work that ebbs and flows, and I think it always has to be front and center as something that we are reflective on and that we're constantly trying to improve and do better.
 With that said, that was the mindset I also came in with.
 And so little small tweaks to making the superintendent weekly memo a little bit more transparent, a little bit more accessible for families was important.
 expected communication each week is important for the community to see updates and also share some of our celebrations.
 We also started this year, maybe a couple months ago, an administrative weekly memo.
 Internally, central office also is now sending out an administrative weekly memo on Sundays just with things that are on the horizon, things to just be mindful of, things to remember.
 Just as another way, I will always say I try my very best with email, but we know how busy or crazy things can get or how things can just happen that
 you know, deter you from what you thought the block of time you had was going to be.
 This allows for making sure we have like a landing place for some critical information and not just rely on email.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 Administrators.
 Yes, yes.
 School leaders, department leaders, non-unit leaders.
 And then responsiveness to situations.
 As with everything, things come up that you are not planning or expecting, whether it is a roof leak, a water leak, the neurovirus.
 When things happen, we are trying to be as thoughtful and as responsive as we can be.
 We know in all of these situations, when the unexpected happens, it can create a level of anxiety, and the absence of information and updates can just increase that.
 And so we are really trying to be very mindful about our responsiveness to situations as they arrive.
 The other piece is inclusive caregiver engagement.
 I also view this as a strength in an area of growth.
 I have tried really hard to make space for community meet and greets.
 We have some upcoming forums this month.
 But I also know, and as I shared in my findings report,
 the work and the area of improvement is how can I be leveraging these opportunities to make sure we're getting and capturing every voice in Medford.
 So sometimes at these meet and greets or these in-person opportunities, it is not always the diverse representation that we know Medford to so beautifully be.
 And so how we can really make sure that we are capturing all voices is an ongoing area of focus and a goal.
 We are very mindful though of our search committees.
 So when we have key critical roles in the district that become vacant due to resignations, retirements, we feel very deeply about the level of varied stakeholder input at the table when we're making big decisions for the district.
 So that is something that we have committed to
 before this position and absolutely committed to moving forward.
 And there's the task force committee.
 So there is the after school task force committee that I committed to in this role as a way to make sure we are having conversation and moving forward with providing a greater level of after school care that families deserve.
 As you know, that's work that we have a consultant that we are working with.
 who is going to provide us a report and some input on the best ways to move that forward.
 I look at Member Parks because she's on that task force.
 I appreciate the partnership of the caregivers that have given their time and dedication to this important work.
 It's a committee that some of the caregivers have received the golden ticket of after school care and some have not.
 So it's important that we hear from
 from all voices.
 An upcoming task force is going to be the one that we talked about prior to the holidays around the space utilization study that came out of the enrollment and overcrowding and the variation of enrollment at the elementary level.
 And so that will interest in caregivers that would like to sit on that task force will be going out very soon so that we can start building that task force.
 And then through the MSBA and through district-sponsored work, there are a lot of advisory committees, which is another opportunity where we're gathering varied voice and input.
 MSBA, we have a lot of opportunities coming up in January.
 And then just like one example of a district-based one is
 The wellness committee and also the advisory committee around food allergies and food safety.
 I attended that meeting and that's important to hear directly from the experience that caregivers have and that their children have around issues that impact what their experience is like when they're in school or when they're engaged in after school activities.
 Personal outreach and visible presence, I would say response to correspondence.
 I try really hard to respond in a timely manner to correspondence or pick up the phone and have conversations if it warrants that.
 But in all honesty, it's also an area of growth to be able to keep up with my e-mails in a timely manner that, honestly, caregivers 100 percent deserve, as well as staff.
 But too often I have to start my e-mails with, I apologize for this delay.
 So that is ongoing work for myself.
 But I have really
 committed to making sure I'm as visible as possible at events.
 I've attended games, sports activities, performances, presentations, community events.
 Not only is it great for me and bucket filling for me to be able to see the wide range of ways that the community supports one another, that the community comes out for one another,
 but also to see from, you know, an inclusive, adaptive performance from Spotlight to the Thanksgiving football game.
 It's just wonderful to see all of the different ways that we're here for one another.
 And then lastly, restoring and enhancing community collaboration and relationships.
 I just want to make sure that I am
 working to build trust or maintain trust in the community.
 And that is both from staff as well as it is from the greater community in the work that we're doing here in Medford Public Schools and the work that I've been doing to help both collaborate and lead.
 Next slide, please.
 So with all this said, planning for the future.
 So over the past year, Medford Public Schools has made significant progress in restoring clarity, stabilizing leadership, and rebuilding core systems, creating coherence across instruction, operations, and community engagement.
 With that work, the next two slides highlight some of the goals.
 They are goals that we want to maintain.
 It's work that we have started, established, laid out, but it's critical to maintain it moving forward.
 And then there are areas of new goals and new focus.
 So first, our continuing priorities.
 These priorities represent a multi-year commitment already underway, and they require consistency, coherence, and disciplined implementation.
 The first one is continuing to strengthen our instructional excellence and coherence.
 that is continuing the work to ground all of our instructional work in belonging, in grade level expectations, and deepening that coherence so that it is seen and felt in every classroom through walkthroughs, calibrated feedback, high quality materials, targeted professional development, and then strengthening our multi-tiered system of support.
 So strengthening those supports for students
 so that they are able to access grade level content and making sure that we are meeting all student needs.
 And making sure that data cycles and progress monitoring remain central to ensuring that every student receives rigorous and grade level instruction.
 Also continuing is advancing operational stability and predictable systems.
 So our focus remains on maintaining consistent operational expectations across facilities, IT, and security.
 And that work means sustaining predictable workflows and following through on deferred maintenance and capital improvements.
 Ongoing safety upgrades and established safety committees will ensure that our schools are safe and reliable environments for our students and staff.
 also is expanding student access and opportunity and voice.
 So we're going to continue to refine our K-12 schedules.
 I think that's an important thing to note.
 So really important the work we did on our schedules but it was also done at the end of last year.
 And so we didn't have time to kind of build how we want that schedule and those opportunities for students to look.
 So part of that work is now focused on what what can this schedule really do.
 And we have the time and space to be a little bit more intentional.
 And I think
 each year we're going to be able to leverage that schedule in a more efficient and effective manner.
 And then strengthening our culturally responsive supports for all learners, and that includes neurodivergent students and LGBTQ plus students, which is essential to everything we do.
 I did highlight this in my
 report of interim findings.
 That was something that came up from a lot of caregivers and a lot of the feedback that I was receiving across the district.
 So that is part of here in our continued priorities but also in our growth areas.
 Enhancing communication and community trust.
 So again really making sure we're looking at our communication structures
 making sure we are using multiple modes of communication, really looking at how we're engaging, how we can increase our engagement to really capture the diverse voice of Medford.
 All of that is continuous work.
 and building the leadership capacity and system alignment, so maintaining strong leadership.
 We started this year, I have started with the principals, a principal cohort, so I
 it's important that they have a cohort that provides them with a system of support, embedded professional development, and aligned work.
 So once a month, a principal will host us for our principal cohort, and we spend time in classrooms, and then we spend time really discussing
 And, and providing input to the principal for next steps.
 How they can take this walk through that we went on together as instructional leaders and leverage it when they're meeting with their staff in meeting times.
 That's work that will be continuing.
 Schools making sure that they have instructional leadership teams.
 and how they're working with them.
 That was another thing that came out of the CBA was an increased opportunity for teacher leadership, which is so important.
 And we have amazing educators who deserve opportunities to really be able to flex that muscle and show some leadership potential.
 And our CBA before,
 did not have any layers of educator leadership.
 And now it does.
 And one of those areas, just to name one, is members on an instructional leadership team.
 And that's a critical role in a school to be working on the instructional work and the teacher being able to work with their peers.
 That is work that is ongoing for us.
 Now moving to work that our new goals.
 And this is kind of the next phase of growth for Metro Public Schools and system building.
 So these goals represent strategic moves for the district to discuss when we engage in our strategic planning.
 This does not mean that there are only four areas to discuss when we start working on our strategic plan.
 But this is just something that has come out of the work that we've been trying to lay for this past year.
 One is strengthening curriculum and instructional coherence.
 I talked about that a little bit, but first and foremost is making sure that teachers have available to them HQIM, high quality instructional materials.
 This not only will assist teachers, but it also will provide them with the time and space to really be focusing their planning on making instruction
 available effectively and meaningfully for students.
 That is work that is critical.
 the implementation of open architects.
 So as I said, Dr. Talbot has gotten this across the finish line, but this is going to mean this year, for the rest of this school year, some training for our administrators and it will be some training for teachers.
 And it also will be continued embedded professional development on platforms and HQIM.
 Secondly is establishing a multi-year operations and capital plan.
 So Mr. Lord has already started a lot of this work, but making sure that our long-term maintenance standards and timelines and reporting structures.
 Mr. Lord came into a lot of work and aligning the organization of these three departments into coherence so that the staff
 at every level understands what is expected and how we are operating is critical.
 And to that is also developing transparent annual updates for the community on the work that is ongoing.
 And again, like I spoke about, but like that finalization of the review of community schools is really critical work.
 Number three, strengthening recruitment, hiring, and retention systems.
 This is a true goal here.
 Building a more diverse pipeline for our staff is a huge goal for Metro Public Schools.
 Quite honestly, it's something we have struggled with a little bit.
 I think our partnership with City Year has provided one opportunity as a way that we can build that pipeline.
 We currently have some of our City Year core members as student teachers.
 And that is wonderful.
 And I believe all of them are at the McGlynn Middle School.
 There might be one at the elementary.
 But having City Year as student teachers and providing that opportunity is one way that we can help diversify our educators.
 Because our students really should see more representation of themselves in classrooms.
 The additional part of that is Dr. Talbot is bringing with her a network of secondary education partners.
 She herself has a close relationship with Salem State University and I think
 her creative way of working with some higher ed institutions and other networks will help us do that work.
 But this is this is an area of focus and of need for Medford public schools.
 And then again making sure that we are finalizing the review that we've been
 Enhancing our onboarding and exiting processes for staff, that has been ongoing, but making sure we're finalizing that to a clear structure.
 And then, of course, updating is needed, because that always happens.
 Once we have a process, we find a way to
 fine tune and make it better.
 Four, strengthen community-centered district planning.
 I spoke about this in terms of capturing the clear, diverse voice of Medford, but I really want to make sure that the strategic plan that we're going to engage in is anchored in the instructional vision
 and that we are able to bring in varied voices of input during this process.
 Part of this work for the strategic plan is and has to be expanding equitable after school opportunities for our families and community programming.
 It's engaging families and stakeholders through the space utilization task force that's upcoming and making some pretty big decisions there.
 And it's through the MSBA forum.
 And so all the work that we are doing to build a new high school is massive.
 We're spending oodles of time making sure that that is, member Graham is going to give us an update, but making sure that we're
 getting that community voice and input into these forums and building a flagship school that's the pride of the district is critical.
 And then fifth is building leadership capacity and system alignment.
 So maintaining our strong leadership development that we have worked on, the principal cohort, I mentioned this before.
 It is ongoing work but it is also continuous goals making sure that we are providing that clarity in our systems and structures and our communication so that we are maintaining stability throughout the district.
 And with that I conclude and happy to answer any questions that you may have.
 And I really thank you and appreciate your time.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4033.578s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.
 Obrigado, Dr.
 Muito completo, excelente apresentação.
 Há alguma dúvida do corpo?
 Membro Ruseau?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4045.305s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Obrigado.
 Isso foi muito.
 Mas antes de tudo, quero dizer que estou animado e isso está muito barulhento hoje.
 Adoro que fique claro que você pode andar e mascar chiclete ao mesmo tempo.
 Não consegui encontrar uma boa analogia que soasse menos americana, para que todos pudessem entender.
 Mas é bom ver quantas coisas diferentes você está cobrindo.
 Bem, francamente, você cobriu tudo o que parecia.
 Várias vezes pensei, ah sim, nós também fazemos isso, certo?
 Portanto, as comunicações são, como vocês sabem, algo que existe.
 dramaticamente melhor do que quando comecei, há oito anos, e estou entusiasmado com o progresso que fizemos.
 É uma daquelas coisas em que você está certo e nunca é feito.
 Não sei se é porque o público muda ou se talvez leve muito tempo para desenvolver totalmente um sistema que acerte o tempo todo.
 Mas minha filha chegou atrasada hoje à escola e quero ler as duas frases daquele e-mail que recebemos.
 Entendo que gostaríamos de ajudar você e seu aluno de todas as maneiras que pudermos para aliviar esse problema de frequência.
 Sempre que um aluno chega atrasado, isso é uma preocupação para nós, pois os atrasos fazem com que o aluno perca instruções importantes e oportunidades de aprendizagem na escola.
 E eu simplesmente não sei quando isso mudou.
 Acho que pode ter sido este ano.
 Mas acho que é um bom exemplo de como não há nada em tudo isso, há mais no e-mail, mas não há nada sobre conformidade e DESE e conseguir, não o Procurador-Geral, mas quem?
 Notário?
 Não, você sabe que se você tiver muitas ausências, costumávamos receber cartas automatizadas, como do promotor público, com jargões jurídicos. Sim, e então é um monte de ameaças. É como podemos ajudar seu aluno a obter educação?
 É por isso que estamos aqui.
 É isso que queremos.
 Então parece uma coisa menor, mas esse e-mail é tão
 descritivo do que vi mudar no distrito desde que você se tornou superintendente interino, então isso é maravilhoso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4189.901s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Posso apenas destacar isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4190.902s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4191.462s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Esse também é apenas um exemplo dessa linha transversal da nossa posição de pertencimento.
 Porque para uma família receber às vezes você tem que ter a conversa sobre a parte jurídica que está ligada ao auxílio, mas receber sem
 Ter uma conversa faz parte de como nos comunicamos.
 Para que possamos compartilhar esse sentimento de pertencimento.
 Então, obrigado por esses comentários.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4218.187s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Na verdade, achei muito descritivo disso, de como me sinto em relação ao distrito desde que você assumiu.
 Além disso, há oito anos me pergunto: o que são escolas comunitárias?
 E nunca obtive, na minha opinião, uma resposta satisfatória.
 E sinto que estou começando a entender que, essencialmente, é apenas uma locadora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4246.366s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: O que também proporcionaria diversão no verão.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4249.81s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Mas realmente teria sido muito mais fácil para mim ouvir essas palavras.
 Agora que entendo o que é, fico muito feliz em saber que está recebendo muita atenção porque
 Sei que há algumas pessoas na comunidade que não estão satisfeitas com estas mudanças e penso que podemos fazer melhor, mas também temos de compreender o que são, o que queremos que sejam e como queremos apoiar a comunidade.
 Então, estou muito animado que esse trabalho esteja acontecendo.
 Para comunicações que giram em torno umas das outras, em torno de incidentes, ou seja, coisas cotidianas fora do padrão,
 Você tem uma revisão pós-ação para cada um deles para determinar, ok, a comunicação não foi bem recebida ou foi bem recebida e como podemos ter certeza de que na próxima vez que houver um incidente de um intruso em um edifício, a comunicação atinge todas as notas da maneira certa?
 Porque o bombardeio de
 reclamações mais tarde é, você sabe, não acho que haja nada de errado com a enxurrada de pessoas furiosas.
 Só quero ter certeza, como na próxima vez que isso acontecer, de que faremos melhor.
 Não necessariamente fazemos isso bem porque você é como uma espécie de prática.
 Mas você tem uma análise pós-ação para cada uma dessas comunicações relacionadas ao incidente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4332.934s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Fazemo-lo pela maioria, não por todos, mas penso que aqueles que
 garantir esse nível.
 Foi assim que fizemos para aquela situação.
 Tivemos mais de um em níveis diferentes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4344.195s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Excelente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4345.336s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Sim.
 Isso é importante para informarmos nossa prática e tomada de decisão daqui para frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4354.108s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Excelente.
 Teremos outra apresentação, e talvez já tenhamos uma no outono, me perdoem se esqueci, sobre a leitura e como estamos fazendo isso?
 Sim.
 Porque eu sinto que estamos no quarto ou terceiro ano realmente renovando tudo isso?
 E eu acho que nos primeiros anos era como
 Entendendo como estávamos fazendo isso, bem, os dados não estavam lá e, você sabe, há uma cauda nisso.
 Esses dados dificultam a compreensão, mas gostaria que víssemos que estamos realmente acertando em cheio.
 Porque estávamos à frente do estado em grande parte nisso e garantindo que todas as crianças pudessem ler na mesma série.
 Não preciso dizer que é um requisito crítico para tudo o que fazemos aqui.
 Então.
 Sim, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4407.735s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: nova apresentação de dados no próximo mês.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4411.877s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Maravilhoso.
 E deixarei meus colegas fazerem perguntas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4416.139s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, membro Ruseau.
 Membro Graham?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4420.421s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Obrigado.
 Eu só queria dizer o quanto aprecio todos os seus comentários sobre
 Suas realizações até agora e seus planos estavam alinhados com o que este grupo e o que eu acho que a comunidade espera.
 Então eu acho que por muito tempo tivemos uma agenda de superintendente e uma agenda de comitê escolar e uma agenda comunitária e todos tinham uma agenda diferente e estávamos todos geralmente operando em uma direção, mas não realmente.
 E acho importante que quando você fala sobre alinhamento
 Você não pode ter sua própria agenda como superintendente se ela não corresponder.
 Bom.
 Se não estiver conectado com o que a comunidade espera e com o que nós esperamos.
 Então, eu realmente gostei que mesmo quando você definiu metas, você traçou uma linha de distinção entre essas metas na qual continuaremos trabalhando porque ainda não chegamos lá.
 E estas são as coisas que
 Achamos que são prioridades importantes que são importantes para você, mas também que vão pesar na conversa de planejamento estratégico que está por vir e que você sabe que é muito necessária.
 Então, sim, agradeço a conexão aí.
 E suponho que o outro comentário seja o que fizemos.
 Uma tremenda mudança no último ano neste distrito, começando com as mudanças de cronograma.
 E não acho que tenha saído perfeitamente.
 Mas também acho que, considerando tudo, tudo correu muito bem.
 e eu acredito
 Ter o Dr. Galusi à mesa do ponto de vista da negociação foi muito importante porque conversamos muito sobre os aspectos instrucionais e o impacto do que estávamos pedindo, o que pode ter parecido de natureza administrativa na época, mas não era.
 Foi assim que nos permitiu fazer algo diferente em termos de instrução.
 Então eu sinto que isso é muito importante, e há uma espécie de
 Inúmeras maneiras de o superintendente se envolver nos bastidores e coisas que o público não vê tão diretamente, mas entende, mas a cauda finalmente está aí e sinto que há muitas coisas nessa categoria para mim onde estamos no meio.
 Então, não acho que vimos o melhor da programação do ensino médio e das aulas desafiadoras porque é o primeiro ano.
 Bom.
 Mas eles me pedem para apresentar no DESE e ter o
 O Secretário de Educação e o Vice-Governador vieram aqui e pude assistir a essa apresentação e conversar com eles sobre como implementamos isso aqui versus como eles veem isso implementado em outras comunidades.
 Foi uma maneira muito cuidadosa de aliviar alguns dos desafios da programação e
 É interessante ver o nível de atenção que tudo isso está recebendo em nosso primeiro ano e também em nossa primeira saída, então tiro meu chapéu para a equipe que eles estão montando.
 Essas coisas acontecem porque normalmente você só recebe crédito pela implementação um pouco mais tarde.
 E só quero comentar que tudo isso foi fruto de um trabalho enorme, principalmente porque muitos cargos ficaram vagos no início do seu mandato.
 Houve momentos em que você era o único em determinados lugares e tinha que lidar com o que estava por vir e estabilizar o distrito.
 Toda essa estabilização parece muito distante.
 Sim, nós fizemos.
 Esse foi o propósito do encontro e de todas essas coisas boas.
 Mas nos bastidores, o que foi necessário para realmente estabilizar o distrito foi
 algo maior do que você pode colocar em um slide.
 E parece tão distante que não creio que você tenha feito justiça em seus comentários.
 Mas estou feliz que esteja no retrovisor.
 Então, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4687.935s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Obrigado.
 Agradeço porque o primeiro dia da minha nomeação provisória foi o dia das ordens executivas.
 Então desde o início houve muito trabalho e muita comunicação.
 Já faz um ano e tanto.
 Agradeço à minha família pela compreensão e apoio.
 Não precisamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4714.008s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Membro Reinfeld e depois nosso representante estudantil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4718.065s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Então, obrigado por isso.
 Como disse o membro Ruseau, estava muito, muito lotado.
 E enquanto pensava nisso, pensava naquela reunião em que muito rapidamente tivemos que nomear um interino e demos a volta na mesa e dissemos: o que procuramos?
 E algumas pessoas disseram que há consistência à medida que fazemos a transição para uma nova liderança.
 E algumas pessoas disseram que ele tinha a capacidade de mudar as coisas.
 com nova liderança, e acho que isso realmente reflete ambas as peças, e aprecio o equilíbrio que estamos vendo aqui, mas não apenas o equilíbrio de, ok, essas são as proporções corretas, descobrimos isso e vamos seguir em frente.
 Reflete muita reavaliação contínua, que é o que precisamos, não apenas no local, nos momentos situacionais, mas realmente, onde estamos agora como distrito?
 Então, eu realmente aprecio isso.
 Eu tenho uma pequena pergunta, uma pergunta complementar do membro Ruseau sobre.
 Então acho que é importante pensarmos sobre isso.
 Acho que é importante pensarmos sobre isso.
 Acho que é importante pensarmos sobre isso.
 Essa garantia de que isso aconteceu e que estes são os protocolos e a clareza em torno disso.
 Portanto, acho que é um assunto muito difícil de comunicar aqui, mas é útil saber em termos da abordagem de liderança ali.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4813.631s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 100% e acho que muito dessa apresentação pode vir do trabalho que o comitê distrital de segurança está realizando.
 E muitas das peças que ouvimos dos membros da equipe.
 especificamente, tratava-se do nível ou falta de desenvolvimento profissional vinculado ao protocolo I Love You Guys.
 Então essa é na verdade uma das prioridades da agenda do Sr. Lord.
 E eu acho que eles
 Abordámos um pouco disso na reunião de hoje para que, a nível escolar, falem sobre formação e redefinição de expectativas em torno desse protocolo.
 Então, sim, há certas peças que, por razões de segurança, não queremos partilhar com a comunidade, mas penso que o progresso daquilo em que essas reuniões a nível distrital estão a concentrar-se e a trabalhar é algo que pode ser partilhado a 100 por cento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4878.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Obrigado.
 E aí eu acho que faltou uma peça, acho que você não falou, mas contratar um gerente de transporte.
 Eu realmente aprecio como você tem observado a equipe e as pessoas que realizam vários trabalhos e como isso pode ser melhor distribuído.
 Você falou sobre isso na liderança central, mas acho que isso está acontecendo também em outros níveis.
 Oh sim.
 Eu percebi isso e queria comentar sobre isso.
 Obrigado por isso.
 Então, vou apenas concluir, porque sei que outras pessoas têm coisas a dizer, que ver estes itens de acção e este progresso apresentados tal como foram, penso que realmente ajuda a determinar que relatórios precisamos como comissão para o próximo mandato, o que queremos ver, que resoluções precisamos
 trabalharmos juntos, então acho que seus comentários sobre a parceria no início são muito apreciados, e eu refletiria isso para você, porque isso foi muito útil para entender o que está acontecendo na frente e nos bastidores, então obrigado por dedicar seu tempo.
 Eu sei que isso provavelmente levou muito tempo para ser montado, além de todas essas outras coisas que estão aqui, então, muito obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4950.968s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4952.009s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, deputado Reinfeld-Alachi, e penso que temos o deputado Olapade e o deputado Prox.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4962.113s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Obrigado.
 Sei que os meus colegas membros da comissão já mencionaram isso, mas foi muito impressionante.
 Acho que você manteve o foco, permaneceu em todos esses inúmeros tópicos diferentes por tanto tempo.
 Quero dar-lhe um pequeno aplauso aí.
 Tenho algumas perguntas, mas quero ser rápido porque sei que outros membros ainda querem ir.
 Portanto, sei que alguns dos meus outros membros estavam falando sobre a Revisão Curricular de Humanidades e Saúde.
 Quem é o responsável pelo processo de revisão para isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=4997.816s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Certo, então a Dra. Kim Talbot é a superintendente assistente de atletismo, com licença, para estudos e instrução.
 Novo título aí, certo?
 Ela ajudaria a liderar esse trabalho, mas a diretora de educação física e saúde é Rachel Perry, então as duas liderariam esse trabalho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5023.072s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Ótimo, obrigado.
 E não sei exatamente que slide era.
 Acho que foram sistemas de dados aprimorados para a tomada de decisões educacionais.
 Você disse que esse tipo de dados que você coletaria por meio desse novo tipo de plataforma analítica e assim por diante seria usado em tempo real para aconselhar sobre instruções e tudo mais.
 Eu acho, você poderia dar um exemplo de como você quer isso ou como está sendo implementado?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5057.953s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Claro, você está falando? Sinto muito, Lachi, porque com o sistema de aquecimento quero ter certeza de que estou ouvindo você corretamente.
 Você está falando de arquitetos abertos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5065.538s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Sim, acabei de lembrar que você disse, ou em minhas anotações, que alguns desses dados seriam usados ​​em tempo real.
 Isso me chamou a atenção, então gostaria de saber se você poderia dar um exemplo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5076.184s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Claro, absolutamente.
 Portanto, o tempo real pode não ser necessariamente
 no meio de uma aula.
 Poderia ser.
 Mas a parte em tempo real é que não precisamos esperar por uma avaliação no final da unidade.
 Não precisamos esperar pelos grandes benchmarks do meio do ano, do início do ano e do final do ano.
 Tempo real significa que os professores terão, através da utilização destes painéis, o Hill for Literacy, também esta plataforma Open Architects, terão à sua disposição dados que
 que eles usam constantemente e que podem informar seu planejamento e instrução no dia a dia ou semana a semana.
 Então, quando você está planejando a semana, quando está planejando o dia, você tem diferentes modos de dados disponíveis.
 E parte disso também são dados que os professores coletam simplesmente para
 As respostas dos alunos, apenas através de bilhetes de saída, indicam que existem inúmeras formas de os professores utilizarem dados que podem trazer em tempo real e que terão impacto no seu planeamento e ensino.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5151.117s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Você imagina isso mais como um nível de turma onde esses professores veem esses dados e, você sabe, poderiam aconselhá-los onde precisam passar mais tempo no currículo, ou é em um nível específico de aluno onde eles podem ver que um aluno está com dificuldades, quer ajudar, ou talvez ambos?
 Como o que é... Todas as opções acima.
 Excelente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5170.553s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Então é no nível do aluno, no nível da turma, no nível do departamento, no nível da série, no nível da escola.
 Tudo isso ocorre porque os professores trabalham sozinhos para garantir que estão atendendo às necessidades dos alunos, mas também trabalham em conjunto com seus colegas para trabalhar em dados de nível de série ou de departamento, líderes escolares e líderes de departamento trabalhando com professores em uma escala maior.
 Realmente é para todos os níveis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5203.812s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Ótimo, isso parece incrível da perspectiva de um professor e educador.
 Senhor, sinto muito por DIBELS, há tantos neste slide.
 Você acabou de dizer que, historicamente, eles ajudaram os educadores distritais.
 Então é algo parecido com o que você está falando?
 usando dados do sistema para orientar seu plano de estudos.
 Ah, DIBLS, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5234.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: DIBL, sim.
 Obrigado.
 Sim, o DIBLS é usado para avaliar o nível e a habilidade de leitura dos alunos.
 Então parece diferente.
 K a dois, assim como de três a cinco, também parece diferente dependendo de cada aluno e de qual é seu nível de leitura independente.
 Dibbles é apresentado como um benchmark e rastreador de progresso.
 Portanto, como referência, é dado a cada aluno no início, no meio e no final do ano.
 Isso é rastreado de alguma forma e são dados usados ​​para relatórios.
 Mas alguns alunos exigem monitoramento do progresso.
 Nem todo mundo faz isso, mas os alunos que estão abaixo do nível escolar precisam monitorar seu progresso.
 Alguns alunos podem precisar ser monitorados.
 a cada duas semanas, a cada quatro semanas.
 Outros alunos só podem vir a cada seis ou oito semanas, então depende do nível de necessidade.
 E então este Dibbles é uma avaliação rápida, dura um minuto.
 Isto também é usado para acompanhar o progresso, para que os professores possam acompanhar nesses intervalos qual foi o progresso, qual foi o crescimento, para que possam realmente concentrar-se nos seus objetivos.
 sua instrução.
 O que é surpreendente sobre a plataforma Hill for Literacy que usamos, chamada Continuum, é que todos esses dados são colocados nessa plataforma.
 E os professores não só têm acesso aos dados, mas também os ajudam a fornecer qual deve ser o foco instrucional para aquele aluno específico.
 Então os professores têm isso no nível do aluno.
 E então eles podem usar esses dados para agrupar os alunos com base nas necessidades que eles têm e realmente concentrar seu ensino durante o tempo em pequenos grupos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5345.573s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Excelente.
 Obrigado.
 Desculpe, só mais um.
 E se você não sabe desde o início, tudo bem, mas qual tem sido o perfil de custo monetário dos arquitetos abertos em comparação com os sistemas anteriores, ou se este é um novo tipo de... Essa é uma pergunta muito boa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5369.05s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Primeiro, quero começar só porque você perguntou sobre Dibbles, e acho que Dibbles é fundamental porque Dibbles custa apenas um dólar por aluno.
 Na verdade, você está pagando apenas pela plataforma, então é muito, muito, muito econômico.
 Arquitetos abertos, sete?
 Ah, 20.
 US$ 20.000 para acesso em todo o distrito.
 Então todos os funcionários, todos os educadores, professores e administradores terão acesso a essa plataforma.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5402.482s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Entendido.
 Obrigado.
 E, novamente, isso foi muito impressionante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5406.845s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.
 Obrigado Elachi.
 Obrigado.
 Membro Lopare, depois Membro Parques.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5413.51s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Obrigado.
 Eu só quero dizer o quanto eu aprecio isso, eu acho,
 explicação completa e profunda que você nos deu.
 Acho que você cobriu bastante em muito pouco tempo.
 Algo que apreciei muito desde o início do seu mandato ou da sua gestão é o peso coletivo do pertencimento.
 E acho que isso ressalta muito do que você detalhou aqui.
 Acho que a conversa sobre comunicação e parceria, incluindo o envolvimento do cuidador, é extremamente importante.
 Muitos dos pais com quem me comuniquei publicamente nos últimos meses têm falado muito sobre o entusiasmo que têm visto em seus alunos ao voltarem da aula para casa.
 Reconheça que está se tornando cada vez mais desafiador ser um pai totalmente envolvido devido ao custo de vida, por exemplo, dificuldades de agendamento.
 Por isso, muitas vezes mandamos nossos alunos para a escola todos os dias e não estamos tão engajados quanto gostaríamos.
 E acho que ter esse aumento de comunicação sempre com espaço para melhorias, como você mencionou, acho que tem sido um grande benefício para o público e para a população estudantil em geral entender mais sobre o que está acontecendo.
 E penso que só quero ser capaz de reconhecer que esta pertença à medida que avançamos para o próximo, os dois períodos ou trimestres restantes para uma das nossas escolas, e depois também para o próximo ano lectivo, é manter essa pertença.
 Acho que a ênfase que você realmente destacou, então só quero agradecer isso.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5492.468s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.
 Obrigado, Deputado Olapade.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5497.068s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: Obrigado.
 Muito foi feito e ficarei acompanhando tudo de perto mais um pouco.
 Estou aprendendo muito mais sobre isso.
 No entanto, uma das minhas perguntas é como o feedback é coletado.
 Eu sei que tem sido muito mencionado sobre isso.
 Você sabe, coisas como elas estão indo bem e algumas coisas não estão indo tão bem, talvez o cronograma ou até mesmo como você coleta feedback sobre arquitetos abertos ou alguns dos outros programas de desenvolvimento profissional e sabe se eles estão funcionando ou se as pessoas estão aceitando-os ou se são estudantes ou professores ou qualquer pessoa realmente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5532.189s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Essa é uma ótima pergunta.
 Ah, não estou perto do microfone.
 Essa é uma ótima pergunta.
 Eu diria que existe
 Quando temos reuniões quando temos desenvolvimento profissional, sempre tem passagem.
 E estamos realmente usando esses dados para estruturar e refinar a próxima sessão e estamos sendo muito intencionais.
 sobre como estamos respeitando esse feedback nas mudanças que estamos fazendo no formato de como fazemos as coisas.
 Acho que fizemos muitas pesquisas.
 Acho que isso reflete um pouco da minha visão atual sobre como coletamos dados.
 Você sabe, recebemos respostas de pesquisas, mas elas nem sempre captam toda a essência de Medford.
 E isso é um trabalho contínuo para nós.
 Sempre há também um nível de dados de ruas.
 Então, quando você encontra pessoas em
 Quando encontro pessoas em passeios, quando visitamos escolas, quando participamos de reuniões, esse nível de feedback também acontece.
 Uma das coisas que realmente temos feito como equipe de liderança, uma equipe central de liderança, é tentar criar landing pages e planilhas.
 para nos fornecer oportunidades de inserir esses dados.
 Principalmente o Dr. Talbot e eu, temos um para que quando ouvirmos essas coisas ou quando algo surgir, tenhamos um lugar onde gravaremos para que possamos voltar.
 Muito semelhante ao que a administração faz ou gosta de criar espaços de pouso para que as pessoas saibam onde podem ir para obter algumas dessas informações.
 Mas eu diria que parte disso também é o trabalho contínuo que estamos fazendo.
 E acho que os próximos fóruns são outro lugar para coletar feedback e contribuições reais das pessoas pessoalmente.
 Sei que também será enviada uma pesquisa, mas reuni muitos dados muito importantes durante o meet and greet.
 e quando participamos dos comitês e do grupo de trabalho.
 Mas, novamente, é apenas uma parte de como garantimos que todas sejam vozes.
 E esse é o trabalho que ainda falta fazer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5703.254s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.

 Resumidamente, Superintendente.
 Ótima primeira reunião para mim e estou muito feliz por colocar em dia todo o trabalho que vocês e especialmente a equipe de liderança têm feito.
 Três coisas que me chamaram a atenção: Está claro que há muitas mudanças e melhorias organizacionais sendo feitas.
 É um trabalho árduo que leva muito tempo e é realmente ótimo de ver.
 Isso se refletiu muito no trabalho que você deseja compartilhar conosco.
 Em segundo lugar, a ideia de apoiar o desenvolvimento curricular, ajudando os nossos educadores a não terem de perder tempo a desenvolver o currículo, mas a concentrarem-se realmente na forma como o apresentam e tentam fazer essa ligação.
 Isso é um verdadeiro multiplicador de força.
 E, novamente, algo pelo qual realmente quero dar crédito a você e sua equipe.
 Isso é uma coisa fantástica.
 E, finalmente, algo próximo e caro ao meu coração são as escolas comunitárias.
 É um recurso da comunidade.
 E como administradores e administradores desses lugares, acho que temos que encontrar um equilíbrio entre a equidade geracional de
 permitindo que você ofereça suporte aos usuários agora e seja capaz de manter esses ativos para os usuários no futuro, daqui a 10, 20, 30 anos.
 Portanto, estou ansioso para ver o que sua equipe nos trará para falar sobre como será o futuro das escolas comunitárias.
 Mas muito obrigado pela apresentação.</p>

 Pouco antes de deixarmos este tópico, gostaria de ter certeza de que deixamos claro para a comunidade quais são os próximos passos em termos da avaliação do superintendente.
 Então vou deixar o membro Olapade nos dizer isso.
 Mas acho que minha pergunta.
 Também para fins de planejamento semelhantes em torno de questões de MSBA, ainda estamos no caminho certo para ter uma avaliação para analisarmos juntos na reunião do dia 26?
 E você precisa da ajuda deste comitê?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5839.358s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Essa é uma ótima pergunta.
 Isso será comunicado aos membros de quem falamos.
 Então sou membro do fórum do Tapa.
 Sou membro do fórum em Branley.
 não os membros mais novos do comitê.
 Isso será divulgado amanhã de manhã para que cada um de nós, agora que recebemos a avaliação do superintendente, possamos compilar nossos pensamentos e nossos desejos para que a comunidade seja conhecida.
 E então pegarei esses dados e os compilarei em uma mensagem concisa.
 Quero deixar claro ao público que o que irei ler é uma combinação de todos os pensamentos e análises de opiniões de,
 Membros estabelecidos na reunião anterior, então não será literalmente de cada membro, a menos que um membro sinta que algo precisa ser dito, mas geralmente esse não é o padrão ou não é o modelo que seguimos, mas estará pronto no dia 26.
 Eu acho que é a reunião</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5896.888s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Se você me permitir levantar da cadeira, só para carregá-lo, nós o receberemos amanhã de manhã e então quando devemos entregá-lo para coleta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5912.096s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Sim, isso me dá cerca de uma semana para reunir todas as informações.
 Não quero insistir mais porque queremos finalizar essa revisão em público antes que o MSBA seja o próximo passo.</p>

 Fiquei pensando, porque você mencionou como está fortalecendo os modos de comunicação existentes, especialmente com os pais.
 Fiquei me perguntando que trabalho foi feito para diversificar a comunicação, especialmente porque estava curioso, então dei uma olhada online e realmente não há muito fora do site da escola em termos de comunicação voltada para o futuro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=5961.114s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Essa é uma ótima pergunta.
 Muito disso é feito em colaboração com meu diretor de comunicações, Will Pippicelli.
 É por isso que mantemos o site.
 Atualizamos nosso site.
 Continuamos atualizando nosso site para garantir que ele forneça às famílias da comunidade as melhores informações possíveis.
 Quando enviamos algo, estamos enviando nossas comunicações.
 através da plataforma em que o site está localizado chamada FinalSight.
 Isso traduz automaticamente as comunicações para as famílias.
 Também usamos um aplicativo chamado Talking Points, que é como um aplicativo de mensagens de texto, para que os cuidadores possam acertar em seus telefones ou dispositivos e também traduz automaticamente qualquer documentação necessária.
 Também temos uma página no Facebook, a página das Escolas Públicas de Medford no Facebook, e essa é a Sra.
 DiPipaselli o atualiza periodicamente.
 E então,
 Envio uma comunicação semanal, e os líderes e diretores escolares também enviam boletins informativos semanais, quinzenais ou mensais para suas comunidades.</p>

 Membro Ruseau, e depois passaremos para o calendário escolar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6055.204s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Obrigado.
 Mas isso foi uma pergunta, quero dizer, você sabe,
 Com o fim dos jornais, não há mais lugar para todos irem.
 E é como se você fosse ao Facebook, Medford Politics tem 2.000 pessoas, a maioria das quais provavelmente mora em Medford.
 E eles podem acreditar que estão se comunicando com Medford quando estão lá e que estão se comunicando com algo de Medford.
 E eu acho que é um desafio, acho que há setores inteiros da cidade para os quais não há outro meio de comunicação a não ser bater na porta ou mandar alguma coisa pelo correio.
 Ambos são tremendamente caros, obviamente.
 E acho que é uma situação triste em que nos encontramos, especialmente quando falamos de uma nova escola secundária.
 Quando falamos sobre uma nova escola secundária, você sabe, não poderemos colocar artigos de opinião nos jornais e pensar que estamos afetando a maioria dos eleitores.
 Portanto, é um verdadeiro desafio do nosso tempo.
 E não invejo nosso grupo de comunicação.
 Então, obrigado por essa pergunta.
 Isso é muito importante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6126.908s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, membro Ruseau.
 E obrigado novamente, Dr. Galusi.
 A seguir, temos a nossa recomendação de aprovar o calendário distrital para o ano letivo 26-27.
 Vou passar para você, Dr. Galusi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6141.815s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Então eu não sei, Sr. Pippicelli, e você?
 Ele é tão bom.
 Obrigado.
 Então passamos algum tempo conversando sobre o calendário para o próximo ano.
 O que estamos aqui para propor como recomendação é esta opção para o calendário escolar do próximo ano.
 Algumas coisas para ter em mente ao enquadrar isso para o ano letivo de 26 a 27 anos: o Dia do Trabalho está muito atrasado.
 O Dia do Trabalho, como vocês podem ver aqui, é 7 de setembro, o que significa que, de acordo com os contratos,
 voltar para a escola na semana anterior.
 Na verdade, isso é para o ano que vem, na primeira semana de setembro.
 Normalmente em um ano, essa semana de retorno é a última semana de agosto.
 No ano que vem, seria na primeira semana de setembro.
 Além disso, o dia da votação primária é terça-feira, 1º de setembro.
 Portanto, o que estamos fornecendo aqui é apenas uma recomendação para seguir praticamente a mesma estrutura que temos este ano para que os professores voltem e tenham seus dias de desenvolvimento profissional, com lançamento na segunda-feira, 31 de agosto e 1º de setembro, e recebendo de volta os alunos da primeira à 12ª série no dia 2 de setembro.
 Isso faz,
 sem dias de neve, último dia de aula em 23 de junho.
 Portanto, se tivermos um dia de neve, teremos que adicioná-lo depois de 23 de junho.
 Também quero ser muito transparente, como já discutimos.
 No ano passado, quando o calendário foi apresentado, devido à forma como alguns feriados caíram,
 Houve uma recomendação de homenagear os feriados principais para fins religiosos, mas não quero dizer menos, mas por falta de uma palavra melhor, não são dias santos tão importantes para se assistir.
 Que estamos adotando uma abordagem semelhante para o próximo ano.
 Mas quero salientar que, historicamente, até este ano, as Escolas Públicas de Medford tinham folga na Sexta-Feira Santa.
 E este é o primeiro ano.
 que é um dia de aula e não um dia de folga.
 Portanto, este calendário proposto para o próximo ano também inclui a Sexta-Feira Santa como dia letivo.
 Espero que estejamos bem, mas também não estamos lá.
 como experimentei naquele dia ainda.
 Então espero que não atrapalhemos por um problema de pessoal.
 Só quero ser completamente transparente quanto ao facto de este calendário estar a ser proposto, mas pode justificar mais conversas em algum momento, depois de vermos o que acontece com esse dia este ano.
 E fora isso, a única parte disso é que existe uma regulamentação do DESI sobre quando a formatura pode ocorrer e a distância entre a formatura do ensino médio e o último dia de aula do distrito.
 E não podem ter mais de 12.
 Isso significa que no próximo ano, para a turma de 2027, formatura, o mais cedo possível seria sexta-feira, 4 de junho.
 Então teríamos que transferi-lo de quarta para sexta-feira, de acordo com os regulamentos do DESI.
 Fora isso, seguimos praticamente a mesma estrutura deste ano.
 Isto foi revisto com o sindicato docente durante o trabalho conjunto.
 E hoje conversei com o presidente do sindicato, Anthony Guillén.
 E esta opção cumpre integralmente o acordo coletivo, por isso, claro, eles apoiam.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6405.45s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Ficarei feliz em responder a quaisquer perguntas.
 Obrigado, Dr.
 E acho que hoje lemos que eles querem ter mais uma sessão de comentários.
 Então você está pedindo votação para apresentar a mesa ou está buscando aprovação?
 Não, estou procurando aprovação.
 Bem.
 Eu tive uma conversa.
 Membro Ruseau, mais tarde membro Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6426.085s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Obrigado.
 Só quero dizer que aprovamos essa política em 2020, e este é o primeiro ano em que o calendário foi apresentado de forma precisa, por isso quero agradecer.
 Na verdade não é uma tarefa fácil, porque você diz, você sabe, eu quero ver as datas de 2026, e é tipo, ah, mas eu preciso de 2027 para algumas delas, mas de 2026 para aquelas que são depois de 1º de setembro, então é um pouco,
 tedioso e confuso às vezes.
 E eu pego a nossa política e pego o calendário proposto e reviso e, você sabe, pergunto ao Chat GPT quando é a data daquele ano.
 E até eu, depois de passar por isso, cometi alguns erros e quase mandei uma mensagem para você dizendo que não estava tudo bem de novo.
 Mas não o fiz porque percebi que estava olhando para o ano errado.
 Então, eu aprecio que isso esteja correto.
 E, quero dizer, francamente, tivemos muita sorte este ano, pois muitos feriados foram no sábado, muitos feriados religiosos para os quais não temos escola foram no sábado, ou, bem, francamente, muitos sábados e domingos.
 Então, do ponto de vista do dia escolar, tivemos muita sorte.
 No ano passado tivemos muito azar.
 Então, estou feliz por não termos que fazer isso.
 Há mais alguma coisa que você gostaria de dizer sobre isso?
 Não, eu só queria fazer uma moção para aprovar a opção A conforme apresentada.</p>

 Abaixo temos a atualização do membro Graham, presidente do MCHSBC, uma atualização sobre o Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.
 Membro Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=6590.903s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Thank you.
 I'm going to try to move quickly, but there has been lots going on.
 So I just wanted to take a minute and give this group an update on some of the work that's been happening and to lay out some of the timeline, particularly around votes and decisions of this body that will have to happen in the coming months.
 So as you all know, back in October, SMMA was selected as our architect.
 We formally signed the contract right before Thanksgiving after a vote of the building committee.
 But they already were on board and working.
 And that part of what has been happening in the last couple of months is this like massive getting to know you phase essentially so that the team at SMMA can
 And so, you know, I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.
 on the part of the architects to really get to know everything about what they call existing conditions, right?
 So what happens today?
 How does it happen?
 Where is the ledge?
 Where is the playing field?
 How does traffic flow?
 Where are the challenges?
 And all of that good stuff.
 So all of that work has been going on, including, like, having to
 And I think that's a really good question.
 I think that's a really good question.
 And like an extensive amount of surveying work, particularly because we're surrounded by the Fells.
 So they've been doing all of that work.
 They're sort of more on campus right now than they are like, you know, sort of out on Winthrop Street and that kind of thing.
 So, you know, the community probably isn't seeing as much of that, but it's still very much going on.
 They're drilling holes to find out where the ledge is and that kind of thing right now.
 There's plenty of rock there, so I'm sure they'll be finding it all over the place.
 All of that work has been going on to get to know this space.
 At the same time, they have been working to get to know what we do inside the building from an educational perspective.
 That work has been really interesting to watch.
 So it started with them having what they called programming meetings.
 So they sat with heads of all of the various different departments that operate in the high school.
 And I think there were like 60 meetings that happened across a whole variety of topics.
 And so they had meetings with each and every one of those departments to understand, you know, or departments, teams, teachers, et cetera.
 What do you do?
 How do you do it?
 Where do you do it?
 All of that good stuff.
 So all of that happened.
 That was like the initial sort of like big, like casting a wide net opportunity.
 Then at our request, they brought on board an educational consultant to help assist us with what has to be submitted called the educational plan.
 So it is essentially like, how do we plan to educate kids in the building when it exists?
 So it's very educationally focused.
 It's things like, are we having a house model or are we having
 grade level model or are we having some other kind of model that is going to drive how space is created in the building.
 So this educational planning consultant has been wonderful and really thoughtful and gave us a recommendation about how to go about crafting all of that.
 It started with a shadow day and
 Administrators and folks from SMMA and folks from the educational planner followed students around for a day.
 Arrival, lunch, passing periods.
 like all of it.
 Right.
 So you know various students in sort of various like grade levels and programming were followed by some number of people for for an entire day.
 He also took a core team on an extended field trip one day.
 I think they saw four schools in a day.
 Is that right.
 To help our team understand what's possible.
 Right.
 Because many people
 have worked almost their entire career in that building or in the district.
 So even understanding what is possible is a really important thing to do at this point in time.
 So the building committee has done some of that touring, some of that touring with that educational plan focus in mind has happened with Mike's leadership.
 Then he held a two-day session where he convened primarily educators,
 and students, as well as administrators, and then a handful of folks from the building committee.
 And I got to be part of that two-day session.
 And I'm a huge critic of those kinds of sessions, because that's what I do for a living.
 And I was just waiting for an opportunity to be like, he could have done this differently.
 And I didn't come up with a single thing that did not go exactly as he intended.
 So he was super skillful and artful.
 just had a really like amazing approach to making sure that any question he was asking was grounded in listening to students.
 So on the first day I sat with a vocational teacher and an administrator and a student and we spent like the entire day together.
 So anytime we would be given an exercise it was like
 The first step of the exercise is to have the student tell you about this thing that we're asking you about and then for the rest of you to ask questions about that experience right so like.
 what are the things that make you feel like you belong here, and what are the things that make you feel like you don't?
 And it was really just fascinating to be part of that.
 And then the second day was a little bit more moving around, so we didn't get to stick in a particular group on the second day.
 But the entire point of the exercise was to start to articulate
 What are we going to do in the building?
 And how are we going to do it?
 And then he finally, at the very end, allowed us to talk about space.
 And it sort of became a running joke that we had these multiple days of sessions, and what we were not allowed to talk about for about a day and a half was space.
 Is it in a classroom or is it in a hallway?
 And is it an open space or a closed space?
 That came at the very end of the two days of work in December, because what he wanted to do was to hear from everybody what we're trying to do, so that when you ask somebody about space, they have two days of talking about how it could be different before they answer the question about space, because envisioning is
 a space that you're going to go to and work in every day that's different than the one you have is really hard if you don't believe that anything about your day is going to change.
 Like why do you need a new space, right?
 So it was a really interesting conversation and I think enlightening for all the participants.
 And the teachers in the room commented about how much they enjoyed the students being there.
 And I do think it set the tone for the conversation in a very different way, which was super fascinating.
 And so we have more work to do coming out of that to say, OK, we have all of these hopes and dreams documented in work that we've been doing in preparation for this.
 And then we have this set of sessions.
 And now what do we do with all of this to create a cohesive picture of what we will do to educate students in this building?
 And I think a good example of something that came out of that is one of the students that sat at my table, she said something kind of innocuous, like, I take a break during every class.
 And
 She's like, I don't really have to go to the bathroom, but I take a break in every class.
 And somebody asked her why, and she's like, well, I just need a break.
 And we're like, fair, right?
 Like fair, when I need a break at home and I'm working, I get to do that when I need a break.
 But then she went on to say, but I would never do that in my CTE rotation.
 And we were like, why?
 Why wouldn't you do it there?
 And she's like, I don't want to miss anything.
 And so one of the things that came out really strongly was students telling us,
 maybe not shockingly, but yet we don't do it, that they want to understand and own their learning.
 Like the students want to know like, why am I learning this thing, right?
 I mean, do you remember saying that to your parents?
 Like, I don't know when I'm gonna ever use this thing in math in my whole life, right?
 And so there was definitely like, I guess I felt like maybe not so old because that,
 like condition of being a student a high school student like still the same right but it was really interesting because it did create conversation around like what should we be doing differently and and why are there things that are succeeding in certain programs that are not happening in other programs and it also opened the door for us as a district to say
 do we have to wait for a new building to do some of these things?
 And the answer is like, absolutely not.
 Like many, many, many of these things could be enacted or changed in advance of a new building, but there will be like an upper limit of what can be done while we wait for a new building.
 So out of all of that will come an educational plan.
 And that plan will come before this body first on the 26th in our meeting.
 So we'll be introducing it then.
 So SMMA will be here with us.
 We'll invite the council to join us at that meeting if they would like to, to hear about it.
 But the absolute thing that this body must do after hearing about the educational plan on the 26th,
 is in our meeting on our following meeting on February 2nd, we will have to approve that educational plan.
 Without our approval that the educational plan can't be submitted.
 And the goal to submit that is February 28th or 27th.
 So that's our first big gate in the feasibility study is what they call the preliminary design report.
 Preliminary design plan.
 And that PDP includes the educational plan.
 That's sort of the realm of this group that we will have to sign off on that.
 And then the other piece of that deliverable will be an initial set of space
 concepts, I'll call them, that we're going to explore more fully and use that as the basis of determining what is feasible, which one we will do.
 That work is for the building committee to do.
 So the building committee will have its own set of requirements between now and the end of January.
 But I did want to tee up that the ed plan will come here.
 So in our meetings on the 26th and February 2, we'll have some dedicated time to talk about the ed plan, answer questions.
 And that will really be largely the superintendent and her team with support from
 Hopefully our educational planner and SMMA as well.
 The building committee simultaneously has a series of activities happening because we are finally at the point where we can talk about the things people want to talk about.
 Where will the building go and what will it look like?
 Will it move on the, will we like renovate it where it is or will we move it on the property, right?
 So all of those are questions that are gonna start to become discussed in the coming weeks.
 So in advance of all of that, on Wednesday of this week at 6.30, we have a Zoom webinar session where we will lay out sort of the process, what's happened and what people can expect in these like next handful of months.
 so that people know how to get involved if they want to, right?
 So there'll be lots of opportunity at the building committee meetings in particular to look at, you know, maybe there's like 20 designs, and we're going to look at 20 designs and say, no, absolutely we hate number five, six, and seven, and the rest of them, like, we like enough to move on.
 And that's going to inform, like, how they then go do some initial cost estimations, and then we're going to review that, and then we'll, like, whittle that down.
 lots of chances for community input in those sessions.
 So on Wednesday night, we'll have like a primer for that so that people understand what has happened so far so that they can come if they want to to the building committee meetings on the 14th and then in February to provide their input and their reaction to some of the things that they're seeing.
 And we didn't want those meetings to happen without that primer and that context happening first.
 So on Wednesday, we'll do that primer.
 Translation services will be available.
 We actually spoke to our community liaisons earlier today about supporting that meeting in multiple languages.
 They've offered to help push out information to their networks so that folks
 Who may or may not be on the MPS mailing list will get to know about those sessions as well and that there are services available for translation.
 And so that initial meeting, we're expecting that to really be information sharing, probably like a light, I'll call it a process-oriented Q&A.
 We'll collect a lot of questions.
 We'll answer the process ones probably on Wednesday night.
 And then, you know, if we can pull off like a QR code so people can tell us about their hopes and dreams for the high school, that's like a great time to start like sort of thinking about that and articulating those things.
 And then we'll create space in the building committee meeting in January and then in February so that when we're rolling out these initial designs, the building committee will be able to like see these designs and think about them.
 And there'll be a place for public input.
 And we talked with the community liaisons today about how to make sure that our communities that require translation services also can be part of that process.
 We're working on plans for that.
 Whether they choose to participate via Zoom or in person, there'll be a translator available and equipment if they need it in person to listen to the translator who is going to translate in live time.
 So all of that will start to happen in our meeting in January at the building committee.
 And the sort of the visual excitement of like what I've been told are like circles on a map, right?
 Like the building could be here, it could be there.
 That's all informed by this sort of monster spreadsheet that articulates what do we have.
 So every single nook and cranny of the building, how big is it?
 How many classrooms is it?
 that kind of thing, and then there's like another section that says like what will the building, what might the building look like, what do we need, and that's sort of a compilation of like what the MSBA will allow in terms of space, what DESE requires in terms of CTE space,
 And then what we uniquely need in Medford to educate kids according to our educational plans.
 That's why the ed plan is so important.
 So this big spreadsheet has been evolving over time and it's super interesting and enlightening.
 And one of the like factoids like I feel like we've been hearing for years that our CTEs are going to get smaller through this project because the MSBA will never pay for spaces as big as we have.
 And that's false.
 It's almost completely false.
 I think there's one program where that is true.
 And it's like a marginal change.
 In all other instances, our programs are operating in space that is too small according to DESI's guidelines.
 So that changes the conversation around preservation of spaces versus doing something different or new.
 It significantly unconstrains the site in an important way, but that space plan
 is the place where we get to like do some myth busting, right?
 One myth that is actually a fact is that the MSBA will not pay for a pool.
 They will share in the renovation of a pool, which we would need a renovation somewhat urgently, but also that our gym spaces are quite large, and those would get smaller, in fact, if we were to build new ones.
 And so right off the bat, they're saying, MSBA, sorry, SMMA is saying that we should be looking to preserve not just the pool, but the field house, which includes like the gymnastics room and the batting cages and a couple, a handful of other like specialty spaces.
 What's the other one?
 Fitness center.
 So, and it's not like marginally bigger.
 What we have is dramatically bigger than what they would allow.
 So that's like a really important, that's actually like a fact that's a fact instead of a fact that's a myth.
 So all of these like fun little nuggets come out of this process and there's so much information that I think
 part of what we're trying to do is figure out how to distill it so that people can get the information that they need out of the process instead of being overwhelmed by things that don't matter to them.
 But we'll try to tee all of that up in our meeting on Wednesday so that the community understands what has been happening because it's been paperwork.
 It's been a lot of really not glorious,
 And definitely not glamorous behind the scenes back and forth around like things that are really meaningful, but only when you get to like, see what they produce not
 the actual space, you know, nobody cares that our classrooms are 745 square feet or 600 square feet.
 They care that like how many classrooms are we going to have in the future or how big does our space get to get and all of that stuff.
 So we're sort of in that process that will inform some of the design choices.
 But I think they have enough information that they're already working through that because we will be seeing some of those early designs on the 14th of this month.
 So I did wanna make sure that this group knew sort of all of that going on.
 So I'm gonna like sequentially read these meetings off to you so that it's clear like how all of these things link together if my phone will cooperate.
 Let's see, where'd it go?
 Okay, so on Wednesday the 7th at 630, Zoom only is this community input session.
 I did get a couple of questions about why it was Zoom only.
 And it is Zoom only because the goal, there are two goals.
 One is to make sure that we could provide translation services.
 And this was the most seamless way to do that the most quickly, which was important because this is a time sensitive meeting.
 And to create a higher quality,
 video production leave behind than can be had in a hybrid setting that is not frankly wired.
 None of our spaces are wired for good lasting recordings of things and we think that's going to be important because maybe you don't want to come on the 7th but you're interested in what's happening a week from now.
 So we want that to be able to live a little bit longer than the moment that it is delivered.
 On Wednesday the 14th at 6.30 in the MHS library and on Zoom will be a regularly scheduled building committee meeting.
 This is where we're going to start to see concepts.
 This is where we will direct the architects on which ones we want to see fleshed out in further detail around cost.
 And then we will
 Then move on to January 26, which is a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 That time does shift a little bit, but sometime after 6 p.m.
 we'll have a regularly scheduled meeting.
 The team will be here to present to us not just what they've been up to, but also that educational plan for review and input.
 We'll invite the council to join us on February 2nd.
 Also, a regularly scheduled school committee meeting.
 This body will vote on the educational plan that will be submitted to the MSBA.
 On Wednesday, February 11th at 630 there will be in the MHS library a building committee meeting and that's where we'll look at not just the concepts but also the initial draft from the estimators that will help inform us on what we want to submit as those things we're going to study in more detail to the MSBA.
 On Monday the 23rd, we will have another building committee meeting where we will finalize our submission.
 So that's the ed plan, that's the space summary, that's the concepts that we want to study, et cetera.
 All of that becomes the PDP that gets submitted and reviewed by MSBA.
 There's no board meeting at that point from MSBA, so they'll provide feedback, but it's like written feedback.
 And then from there we'll move into what is called the preferred schematic report.
 That is where we will go from, let's say we have 10 options before us in February.
 By June we will have one.
 So that preferred schematic report timeline will help establish
 How do we go from 10 to 1 essentially?
 So obviously lots of like continuing feedback from Desi and others as we do that.
 But what we'll submit in terms of options to be studied will then go into another community input meeting where we'll be explicitly saying to the community, here are the 10 options we're talking about.
 Tell us what you think about them.
 So that's scheduled for Thursday, March 5th in the MHS library.
 And then we'll shift into a regular building committee meeting at the end of March on the 23rd.
 where we'll get an update and we'll continue talking.
 So that's the next three months of this project.
 So really by the end of March, we'll be deep in the throes of whatever those options are that we're studying, really doing the work to do the cost estimation to understand in more detail, what does this building look like?
 No longer circles on a map, but actual visual details.
 and cost.
 So all of that will be happening really pretty quickly now that we have come out of the holidays.
 We certainly timing wise didn't we we prioritized
 doing the work that we did over the holiday, which was very brutal for the people involved behind the scenes, so that we had the community's full attention before everyone checks out for summer.
 There's this magic window, I think, of community engagement from January to May or June that we want to capitalize on and the timeline helped us do that.
 There will certainly be more to come about the second half of the year of 2026 in terms of this project.
 But I just wanted to lay all of that out and field any questions because I think there's a lot of questions in the community and I think we're finally at a point where there's answers and not just questions.
 So I'm looking forward to providing people some answers as we go here.
 But I'm happy to answer any questions that you all have about the process next steps that kind of thing.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8120.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Membro Reinfeld.
 Obrigado.
 Isso é super emocionante.
 Sim, finalmente.
 Sim.
 Estou muito animado com isso.
 Bem, a minha primeira pergunta é: podemos emprestar algo daquela sessão de visão para as nossas reuniões de planeamento estratégico?
 Porque isso parece incrível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8136.725s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Foi realmente maravilhoso.
 E acho que algumas pessoas na sala disseram: precisamos fazer isso com todos os professores do ensino médio.
 E então havia muita energia em torno do que poderia acontecer.
 E acho que um dos reconhecimentos e Mike,
 quem é o chefe da organização, ele disse, sabe, quando você ouve histórias de escolas que construíram alguma coisa e depois não usam, né?
 Você ouve isso o tempo todo.
 E ele disse que isso acontece porque
 As pessoas fazem uma lista de suas esperanças, sonhos e desejos.
 E eles dizem: “Será ótimo se pudermos ter essas coisas”.
 E aí todos fecham a lista de esperanças, sonhos e desejos e aguardam a chegada do prédio.
 e uma espécie de esperança de que o edifício os transforme.
 E o prédio não vai fazer isso.
 A transformação tem que acontecer por parte das pessoas, porque quem realmente tem que mudar são as pessoas, certo?
 Então conversamos um pouco sobre
 Depois de desenvolvermos este plano educacional inicial, que tipo de oportunidades de desenvolvimento profissional e sessões de colaboração devem ocorrer para realmente começarmos a desenvolver de forma colaborativa?
 O que podemos fazer antes que este edifício seja inaugurado?
 E quando podemos fazer essas coisas?
 e quais apoios são necessários.
 E esse é outro trabalho que esta equipe de planejamento educacional realiza.
 E eu certamente disse: “Terei prazer em lhe dar sugestões”.
 Ficarei feliz em lhe dizer como fazer isso sozinho.
 Fico feliz em ajudá-lo a fazer isso.
 Mas sim, acho que vai direto ao ponto, como o trabalho que ele fez para desorientar todos do que quer que eles pensassem que vinham nos contar,
 É importante e é um trabalho habilidoso, por isso acho importante pensar realmente nos próximos passos.
 Acho que usaremos muitas das mesmas técnicas em nossas sessões de planejamento estratégico, embora tenhamos um público um pouco menos controlado, então navegaremos por isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8273.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Isso foi bastante curativo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8275.047s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim, sim.
 Sim, e acho que quando você tem um público selecionado, você pode realmente liderar, e também tentaremos fazer nossas sessões de planejamento estratégico em duas horas.
 Tivemos dois dias.
 Portanto, teremos que agir de maneira um pouco diferente, mas muitos dos mesmos conceitos semelhantes serão aplicados com certeza.
 Sim, eu gostaria que houvesse uma maneira de as pessoas capturarem isso e compartilharem em vinhetas de alguma forma. Sim, e acho que, para você, uma das coisas sobre as quais podemos conversar é como capturamos isso, porque acho que foi realmente
 É legal o que aconteceu e acho que talvez haja uma oportunidade de fazer isso sobre a qual possamos conversar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8311.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, só estou pensando que meus filhos não gostaram disso, mas tenho recebido mensagens desde hoje. Só que faz mais frio no colégio do que lá fora e outro dia ensinei um arquiteto a fazer trança francesa.
 Então, é realmente maravilhoso ver esse aluno focado.
 Então acho que a maioria das minhas outras perguntas agora tem a ver com essa comunicação à comunidade.
 Na verdade, estou muito feliz que Simon tenha levantado esta ideia, esta questão de chegar a pessoas fora da comunidade escolar.
 Temos muitas estratégias para fazer isso e eu adoraria fazê-lo.
 Eu adoraria divulgar essas informações no fórum, seja por meio de pontos de discussão ou por e-mail nas escolas.
 Eu sei que isso não se aplica necessariamente à comunidade de Medford em geral, mas estou pensando, estou olhando para todos os diretores do ensino fundamental aqui na plateia, mas estes são os alunos que viverão neste prédio e também na escola secundária.
 Então seria ótimo enviar esse aviso antes de quarta-feira, mas estou pensando se podemos montar algum tipo de panfleto de mochila nessa época com o aviso de isenção de responsabilidade, sujeito ao clima da Nova Inglaterra e tudo mais, e aqui está como se inscrever, se houver um boletim informativo saindo, aqui está como se manter informado sobre esse projeto, se pudéssemos enviar algo físico para as famílias em breve, seria realmente</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8399.811s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim, há algumas coisas fermentando lá também.
 Enviaremos um lembrete para você.
 Will entrou em contato com Steve no gabinete do prefeito para informá-lo sobre esta reunião.
 Excelente.
 Os contatos comunitários comunicarão esta reunião às suas comunidades que necessitam de serviços de tradução.
 E enquanto falamos sobre datas importantes, outra coisa sobre a qual conversamos hoje com os representantes da comunidade foi como dar às pessoas a lista exata do que está por vir.
 Então, quando montamos tudo, podemos fazer muitas coisas com ele, inclusive encher alguns folhetos e mochilas.
 Portanto, a comunicação sobre a reunião foi feita de duas maneiras diferentes.
 Enviaremos um lembrete, mas depois podemos colocar assim,
 como Trail of Breadcrumbs, uma espécie de programa de encontro de mochila para nossos alunos do ensino fundamental e também para divulgá-lo por todos esses canais.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8457.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Porque penso que conseguir isso através da escola pode envolver algumas das nossas famílias que
 Com todo o respeito, eles podem não seguir tão de perto o memorando semanal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8466.62s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim.
 Acho que outra coisa sobre a qual falaremos é como criar um boletim informativo de lista de e-mail que possa ser usado para comunicações mais amplas fora da comunidade escolar, para que as pessoas da comunidade que desejam receber notificações explícitas sobre coisas no comitê de construção o façam.
 Portanto, temos muitas coisas orientadas para a comunicação que
 Começaremos a avançar para que possamos criar uma base maior de pessoas informadas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8496.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Excelente.
 E acho que minha última pergunta foi sobre isso.
 Eu sei que quando você começou havia um subcomitê de comunicações e envolvimento da comunidade e queríamos apenas garantir que ele permanecesse ativo e forte.
 E se há algo que este corpo conhece metade
 Boa metade das pessoas, bem, há mais pessoas nesta sala nesse comitê do que não.
 Ele participou de vários comitês de construção em Somerville e é gerente de projetos de instalações.
 Acho que sou a única pessoa aqui que não está envolvida em obras.
 Mas tudo o que pudermos fazer para apoiar esse comitê na divulgação.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8530.081s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim.
 Esse subcomité não se reúne há algum tempo porque centrámos a nossa atenção em todo o trabalho nas condições existentes.
 Mas acho que há uma oportunidade de reunir novamente essa equipe e conversarei com os membros dessa equipe sobre como fazer algo que possa ser publicado, como talvez um boletim informativo mensal ou algo que possa ser escrito por um subconjunto do comitê de construção.
 Então falaremos sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8554.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Isso seria ótimo.
 Meu objetivo aqui é que ninguém se surpreenda quando surgir a exclusão da dívida.
 Ah, absolutamente.
 Desculpe.
 Ponto justo.
 Vamos trabalhar muito para conseguir todos.
 Ou quando ficam surpresos ao saber onde procurar mais informações.
 Então, obrigado por todo o trabalho.
 E obrigado a todos que têm feito esse trabalho, pois sei que é muito.
 E estou muito animado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8582.266s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.
 Você tem que dizer algumas palavras.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8589.509s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: Mais uma vez obrigado, Simón Alcindor, Rua Tainter 44.
 Eu só tive algumas perguntas rápidas.
 Em primeiro lugar, sei que você mencionou brevemente o transporte quando falou sobre a fase exploratória disso.
 Você tem mais detalhes sobre o que exatamente eles estão fazendo, principalmente no que diz respeito ao trânsito, já que é um lugar meio isolado?
 Estou meio interessado nisso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8612.321s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim, isso surgiu de duas maneiras diferentes.
 Além de tudo o que falei, esqueci de mencionar que temos quatro comitês consultivos.
 Há cerca de 70 pessoas nos quatro comités a falar sobre quem são membros da comunidade que se juntam a nós numa função específica.
 E um desses subcomitês trata da segurança do site.
 E o tema transporte surgiu naquela reunião pouco antes das férias.
 Portanto, as conversas que estamos tendo sobre transporte são algumas coisas.
 Uma delas é sobre a natureza unidirecional de onde nossa escola está localizada.
 E falando nisso, ouvimos do delegado, do delegado em especial, que o acesso emergencial é algo que precisamos explorar, e a equipe está falando sobre isso.
 Também estamos falando em criar um melhor fluxo de tráfego ao redor do edifício, onde quer que ele esteja localizado.
 Então uma das coisas que os arquitetos comentaram é que
 A forma como a propriedade está disposta agora prioriza o estacionamento em vez do fluxo.
 Muitos dos problemas que temos podem ser amenizados prestando atenção ao fluxo ao redor da propriedade.
 O exemplo que surgiu em nossa sessão de visão foi o dos alunos dizendo:
 Eu tento sair da minha última aula alguns minutos mais cedo porque tenho que pegar o ônibus e ele fica do outro lado do prédio da escola e se eu não chegar não consigo lugar ou não consigo entrar porque está lotado, né?
 E eles falam, e aliás, é a mesma coisa, todo mundo sai pela mesma saída, né?
 Então, se você for pego de carro, se for pego de ônibus, se for a pé para casa, todo mundo sai pela mesma saída.
 É uma loucura, certo?
 E aí eles disseram: os ônibus podem estar em outro lugar?
 Foi assim que os alunos perguntaram.
 Podemos simplesmente colocar os ônibus em outro lugar?
 E a resposta em nossa propriedade atual é não.
 Mas num novo edifício onde pensamos, bem, como é que as pessoas chegam a esta escola?
 Como se eles chegassem a pé.
 Aliás, é um terreno muito íngreme, certo?
 Então, se você for de bicicleta, é um trecho bem íngreme subindo aquela colina.
 E eu não sou motociclista, mas não consegui.
 Então, quantas pessoas estamos dissuadindo?
 Porque há um tom muito pronunciado, e há resposta para isso?
 Mas também, como podemos garantir que não nos encontremos todos no mesmo ponto de estrangulamento, essencialmente, que é o que está a acontecer hoje?
 Então, tudo isso está sendo discutido e até surgiram coisas como provavelmente precisaríamos conversar com a MBTA sobre os horários dos ônibus e se há alguma alteração que possa ser feita para criar um melhor acesso.
 E você sabe que quando começar a falar sobre esse tipo de coisa, os alunos dirão com razão que não há ônibus atrasados.
 Então, se eu tentar, um dos alunos me disse que eu iria me esforçar para ficar, para não ficar depois da escola, porque se eu ficar depois da escola, terei que caminhar três quilômetros para casa.
 e levo uma hora.
 Depois porque não há autocarros atrasados.
 Então, nessas sessões surgem muitas coisas que não precisam, como o atraso de um ônibus, não tem nada a ver com o fato de esse prédio ser antigo ou novo, mas sim surge no contexto do problema coletivo que precisamos resolver.
 Então, sim, há muita conversa sobre transporte e estou animado para ver como isso flui.
 Cada vez que chego ao canto traseiro daquela curva fechada, penso:
 Quem fez isso?
 Por que está tão apertado?
 Mal consigo mover meu carro gigante por lá, quanto mais dois carros.
 Então esse é o tipo de coisa.
 E então, se você pensar se vai...
 Ele faz isso, ele faz isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8850.138s">[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>: Esses dardos de ônibus podem fazer um milagre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8852.42s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mas se você der a volta pelos fundos do prédio para deixar uma criança no campo, terá que se virar e voltar por onde veio.
 Portanto, esse é o tipo de conversa fluida que eu realmente espero que melhore significativamente quando começarmos a falar sobre como este novo edifício pode ser projetado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8874.665s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: E aí separadamente, as reuniões do comitê serão realizadas de acordo com o calendário de eventos da cidade e tal?
 Sim.
 Porque eu percebi que são, pelo menos não o de quarta, né?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8886.248s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correto.
 Ainda não.
 É um trabalho em andamento.
 Então as férias seguiram o seu caminho.
 Will tem colocado todas essas coisas no calendário do MPS e compartilhado com a cidade para que eles possam estar lá também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8897.411s">[WaNbAOKeDiY_SPEAKER_18]</a>: Bem.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8898.192s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim.
 A qualquer hora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8899.732s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Muito obrigado.

 Os membros.
 Você só quer dizer isso para que o público possa ouvir?
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/q1XLT9n3ed0&t=8959.225s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: Sim.
 Nos conhecemos depois das aulas, no ensino médio, então sei que alguns membros manifestaram interesse em participar de algumas de nossas reuniões.
 Entraremos em contato com você sobre isso.
 Mas repito, se algum de vocês,
