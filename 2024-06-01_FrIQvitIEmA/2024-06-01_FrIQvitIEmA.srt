1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:00,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Campbell?

2
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:01,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

3
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nemex?

4
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,911
Present.

5
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,451
Councilor Scarlatoiu?

6
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:11,812
Present.

7
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice Mayor Collins?

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

9
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Covering Committee, November 31st, 2024.

10
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,936
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of this meeting is to review the 2024-2025 Council Covering Agenda.

11
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: as amended at the January 24, 2024 Committee of the Whole.

12
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:33,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I cannot hear you.

13
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you move the thing onto the podium, maybe?

14
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:36,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good idea.

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,430
[SPEAKER_07]: With air conditioning.

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:50,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this better?

17
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:56,322
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

18
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:58,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, I can hear myself.

19
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is our first meeting of the planning and permitting committee.

20
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:15,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice Chair Leming is unable to be present for this meeting because he has a prior commitment, but he is the vice chair.

21
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:31,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So much like our first committee meeting for the Administration and Finance Committee last night, the purpose of this meeting is to go over the section of the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda that pertains to projects in this committee.

22
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:40,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a bunch of projects and papers that have already been allocated to this committee for working on and discussing, and there are also

23
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:49,067
[SPEAKER_04]: papers in committee from previous terms of the Council, we can take a look at that section of our agenda, so to speak.

24
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:55,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been totally fleshed out yet, but it will in coming weeks by myself and President Barras and other members of this committee.

25
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think much like last night, what it probably makes sense to do is to just quickly run through what is currently in the governing agenda under the planning and permitting committee auspices.

26
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Sponsors of any projects can

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,852
[SPEAKER_04]: give a brief synopsis or summarization of goals of those projects as they put forward.

28
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:26,294
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody has questions about new or old projects or papers in this committee, totally fair game.

29
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the time to talk about that.

30
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:37,298
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a number of very large projects that will kind of be overarching in this committee throughout the term, in addition to ones that might be more quickly dispensed with.

31
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll also take a look at the draft timeline, which, of course, can be amended over the course of the term.

32
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Do any councilors have comments they'd like to make before we start taking a look at our governing agenda?

33
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:54,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing none, let me work on sharing my screen so we can look at that together.

34
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,920
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, is my screen visible for the, say, agendas and minutes at the top?

35
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

36
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:26,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Clark.

37
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:35,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So just proceeding right along to the section of the governing agenda for the planning and permitting committee.

38
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:44,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over this in some detail in our committee of the whole about the governing agenda overall, so I'm not going to go into great detail about, you know, we also have

39
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: sections of our code of ordinances that just live in here.

40
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this will probably be more relevant for other committees than it will be for ours.

41
00:03:51,128 --> 00:04:03,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The thinking that if it comes the time for one of our recurring meetings and there's nothing to work on, we can be looking into our code of ordinances to bring up to date other ordinances that fall under our jurisdiction.

42
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that'll be a problem for this committee.

43
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a ton to work on.

44
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we'll have a lot of dead time during our meetings.

45
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:12,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can always revisit this first section if we need to.

46
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:19,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense to first talk about or at least first look at zoning reform.

47
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,740
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a huge project.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,302
[SPEAKER_04]: This will probably organize most of the other projects within this committee over the course of the next 23 months.

49
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:36,644
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears and I have initiated, I mean, this project has been initiated at the very end of last term.

50
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The council selected a zoning consultant to work with this council to structure this process to provide

51
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,413
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, specialized expertise in implementing.

52
00:04:47,895 --> 00:05:01,762
[SPEAKER_04]: the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate adaptation plan, other known goals and shared values that this community has, that the administration has, that this council has, and make sure that those are borne out in a comprehensive review and updating of the zoning process.

53
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:11,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working on finding a date for Planning, Development, and Sustainability staff and the zoning consultant to come before this committee just to serve as a public introductory meeting.

54
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:15,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can talk about the timeline and structure for that project, Councilor Callahan.

55
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:22,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was hoping that we can, for all of these, have a status in each of these.

56
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's super helpful to have a status.

57
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:31,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So even zoning reform, it's helpful for us, but also for the public to know, oh, there was zoning reform.

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,186
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a minor zoning reform that happened last cycle, but we expect to be doing more major zoning reform.

59
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,965
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think even for any of the ordinances and things, even if it's not started, it would be great to have a status put in there.

60
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:50,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Harreld.

61
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:57,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to clarify, do you think what would be valuable is sort of like goals or maybe like last action taken?

62
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,971
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why this is here right now.

63
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So status being things like not started,

64
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:10,408
[SPEAKER_07]: proposed, like I don't know what they all are going to be, but like a status.

65
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:18,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's anything that can be easily put into like a short sentence for people to give people any context around that.

66
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

67
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

68
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Just making a note of that.

69
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:33,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we can definitely, as we start to spin up our process of sort of end of month updating of the governing agenda, we can certainly workshop that and figure out a way to just quickly

70
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,183
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that that like one or two sentences for each project is being revised.

71
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:59,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, the structuring, the breaking down this very large two-year project into manageable pieces is something that this committee will be working on in concert with NS Associates, which is the zoning consultant that this council selected, and Planning Development and Sustainability staff.

72
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:04,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But the overall approach, I think, will be to take

73
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: our ambitious goals of reviewing and updating all of our zoning ordinances, find a way to organize that by goal, by topic, by category, so that we can be doing those updates, be making those updates in a way that makes sense and is efficient.

74
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:22,536
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certainly a lot for us to get through in two years.

75
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:31,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that organization, what that structure looks like is something that we will be meeting about and talking about in coming weeks and months.

76
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:33,799
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

77
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:34,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

78
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, yeah, just to add.

79
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:48,535
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically what we want to bring to this committee as a starting point is a draft of the categories and, you know.

80
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Housing, affordability, housing, production, business development.

81
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,592
[SPEAKER_00]: uses and dimensional requirements, whatever those might be.

82
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:03,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can develop, co-create a list of goals that we want within each category.

83
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:09,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Then personally, I mean, obviously, it's up to the chair, but as a member of the committee, I would expect probably almost at least once a month.

84
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:16,662
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the reasons this committee is meeting twice a month is that it has this project and then a bunch of other projects.

85
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:22,165
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be pieces of this project on the agenda every two weeks for this committee to work through.

86
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,105
[SPEAKER_00]: We might say,

87
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,728
[SPEAKER_00]: March, we're going to do housing production, right?

88
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to look at.

89
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,023
[SPEAKER_00]: For housing affordability, we want to look at inclusionary this that the other 1st meeting.

90
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,104
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the basics of it, go through an initial proposal.

91
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:39,685
[SPEAKER_00]: We have questions, updates, and comments.

92
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:44,189
[SPEAKER_00]: We send that back to our consultants, the NS Associates folks.

93
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:47,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need legal input from the Bobrowsky Silverstein firm.

94
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:55,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that could come back like two weeks later, and we could discuss the amended and updated version, and maybe we move that forward.

95
00:08:55,638 --> 00:09:01,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other piece of this that we discussed so far was there may be some like low-hanging fruit that we get at right away.

96
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:10,767
[SPEAKER_00]: In a category, and then there may be some things that need 3, 6, 9 months, you know, or more to get through really big changes and decisions.

97
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for example, just on the zoning map, the current zoning.

98
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,765
[SPEAKER_00]: the digital map is pretty much ready to go.

99
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:27,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we're changing the map completely in this term, which may well be what we do, it still benefits the permitting process to have the digital map of the existing zoning in place.

100
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we pass that early and then we pass a new digital map in several months.

101
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:36,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

102
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:37,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

103
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:43,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be helpful under descriptions and goals if we actually

104
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:55,094
[SPEAKER_07]: called out housing production plan section 5B to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the climate action plan 2.2.D, blah, blah, blah.

105
00:09:55,414 --> 00:10:05,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So rather than these generic implement Medford Comprehensive Plan, which even I who have read the Medford Comprehensive Plan don't, that's so vague.

106
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:11,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that be a helpful way for us to have a full list, even though I know that would be long?

107
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:22,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a way for us to maybe each of us take things that we're like, I'm trying to figure out how we can break this into chunks to make it into like a list of things that we actually want to accomplish.

108
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I really appreciate that kind of approach to how to work through this.

109
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:33,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I think that some version of that approach is what we will inevitably end up doing.

110
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:40,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that one way we might come to that approach is we are working with planning development

111
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of have a two track approach to breaking this down into manageable pieces.

112
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that our zoning consultant might have a perspective on what categories

113
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,566
[SPEAKER_04]: might make sense to work on together.

114
00:10:54,586 --> 00:11:17,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, from this council being representatives of the community and being very well versed in these plans, we then, I think it is, in my opinion, as one councilor, I think it's our role to then come to those topics with a set of priorities and say, this is our priority for what we do in the realm of doing something that affects housing stock, housing density, housing character.

115
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,653
[SPEAKER_04]: based on what we know from our plans, based on what we know from constituents.

116
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:45,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that individual Councilors getting very specific on what we would like to do in certain categories, something that we could certainly start to do at any time, and I think that when we are able to sync up with NS associates and planning staff in the next few weeks about what kind of timeline we might be looking at as we work to develop that timeline of what we'll work on when, that might give us some clarity on

117
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:55,775
[SPEAKER_04]: when could we collectively have those conversations about what's going on our punch list and figure out a process from there.

118
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:56,756
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree.

119
00:11:56,796 --> 00:12:02,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I suspect that we all have in our heads those specifics that we're shooting for.

120
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite soon will come the time, sooner than we know it, will come the time to start implementing those.

121
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

122
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

123
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:20,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important as we start in this new format that we're not redundant.

124
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:26,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have, it's how we're rolling this out, something with the zonal reform.

125
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something so important that, you know, having one Councilor do the legwork, then three other Councilors do the same legwork.

126
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:40,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, to the community process, then again, I think we,

127
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:48,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna make this more than it has to be in the sense that let's not suffocate.

128
00:12:49,315 --> 00:13:00,221
[SPEAKER_01]: the common resident and the fact that what we're trying to do is great and really highlight and stress certain aspects of what we're doing and certain agenda items.

129
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:06,365
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I think zoning could be a little different because it is so important and it is citywide.

130
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:16,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's one of the reasons why we spent so much time making sure that we secure the funding for the consultants, making sure that we have the right team in place with the

131
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:26,017
[SPEAKER_01]: office of community development and making sure that we create something that we're encompassing everybody's efforts.

132
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:42,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we, something similar that we use, for example, the way Somerville, when they started their projects, as they started looking at their gateway communities, whether it was lower Broadway, whether it was Assembly Row, it was always done.

133
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:43,710
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't done in a vacuum.

134
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something very open and transparent where I think that could be

135
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:56,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to have the same thing said over and over again because the redundancy might pull people away from being part of it.

136
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:12,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that makes sense, I'd rather see us work more as a team and show the unity together with the community, especially with what our ultimate agenda is when we push any of our subcommittees through.

137
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,266
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's my opinion.

138
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:15,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

139
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

140
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:24,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really important point with anything, and especially with a project of this scale that we've been gearing up to for such a long time.

141
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:27,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be really important.

142
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:32,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to me, I'm thinking a lot about budgeting time for this project, because it's such a big, ambitious project.

143
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:36,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that avoiding duplicating efforts will be really crucial.

144
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:41,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And it dovetails with what Councilor Callaghan was saying about how and when are we getting organized to make sure that we're doing what we want to do.

145
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tsenglin, President Bears.

146
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:50,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councilor Bears is staying on topic, so if you can go to him first.

147
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:50,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

148
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:52,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just super quickly.

149
00:14:52,902 --> 00:15:00,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this may be one of the projects where it gets its own document, and it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

150
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,609
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree on a set of categories.

151
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if exactly for the public, we should say, you know,

152
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:13,931
[SPEAKER_00]: This meeting is going to be on this topic, not on all 12, you know, we'll agree on the 12 to start or whatever, 7 or 9 or whatever it is.

153
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:18,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Each meeting is discrete on each topic as best as we possibly can.

154
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a little bit of a, we have to do a formal vote formality to move something along.

155
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:24,464
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been amended.

156
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:29,048
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to keep the topics clear and each each meeting of this committee.

157
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:33,511
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, we're talking about Mystic Avenue this week.

158
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:37,554
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about citywide housing affordability this way.

159
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,776
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, you know, what our.

160
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,940
[SPEAKER_00]: corridors are going to look like between our squares, right?

161
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are just example potential topics.

162
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:53,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep that so that all of us can bring all of our ideas about corridors to the corridors meeting.

163
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,987
[SPEAKER_00]: The public can bring their ideas about corridors to the corridors meeting.

164
00:15:56,568 --> 00:16:06,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, once since we'll have those kind of sections off first, we can inform people weeks, maybe even months in advance about when we're going to be taking up specific things.

165
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:10,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be perfect, but I think that's

166
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:17,222
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest, I think the biggest advantage of the way that we did committee of the whole before this is it was always on one topic.

167
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very clear to everybody what the message of the meeting was.

168
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:25,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things we're going to have to think about and being clear about with this new.

169
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,490
[SPEAKER_00]: committee model is trying to preserve some of that.

170
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:37,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it's not we're meeting on 17 planning and permitting things in one night and people don't know what's what and what's happening.

171
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:41,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for this project, especially this is going to be, that's kind of at least where I'm coming at it from.

172
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:54,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think where Chair Collins is, and I also think it's also where PDS is and where Innes Associates and the lawyer, you know, that consulting team is, everyone's kind of on the same page.

173
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Chunk it out, break it up and be clear.

174
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:04,946
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to do 12 things at once, but do 12 things relatively in sequence as best as we can.

175
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:07,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, we have the advantage of.

176
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:14,708
[SPEAKER_00]: this group meeting twice a month so we can do a little bit, you know, won't be as much time in between.

177
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:22,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we need to do two meetings for a really hefty topic, spread it across two weeks, we'll have a little bit more flexibility and maybe we'll find that we need to meet even more.

178
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:25,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be another adventure through this process.

179
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:30,399
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's similar to how we did the recodification, I think, as well in the last term.

180
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, across two terms, actually.

181
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:36,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, how long has this been in the first my first term?

182
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,365
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we kind of went through

183
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:44,928
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the zoning ordinance, there's 10 or 11 sections in the new one, and we went through each one.

184
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:55,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at dimensional requirements, we're looking at zones and uses, we're looking at all the other special regulations, that kind of thing.

185
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be hopefully similar here.

186
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

187
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:09,624
[SPEAKER_04]: By all means.

188
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my living room, George.

189
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,252
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we were doing that the other week and I was like, yeah, let's go.

190
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.

191
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,375
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hard for Adam to take notes though.

192
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:43,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a feeling that Zach was going to address some of Councilor Scarpelli's points.

193
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make sure you spoke first.

194
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to add to the zoning thing.

195
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:53,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So, essentially, I got a chance to sit down with some staff in the Planning and Development Office.

196
00:18:55,956 --> 00:19:08,643
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, Director Hunt, and we kind of talked about gaming through some of the ideas on the governing agenda to see any ideas they had about it, but also how to implement it.

197
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:19,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And she highlighted that a few of the ideas that we want to work on here would be best done parallel to the zoning effort, if not just in it as well.

198
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:30,792
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, the transit demand management idea that Councilor Leming and I have been working on, the green score idea in here as well.

199
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:36,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the energy ideas, but that's a little bit separate as well.

200
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to put it out there that that's the direction that city staff would want to go in with some pieces of the governing agenda to do it while we're doing zoning as well.

201
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:53,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Councilor Tseng I actually think that's a really helpful point to bring up.

202
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:59,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just so that we can look at this visually, as we're talking about kind of timing of projects.

203
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:09,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes a lot of sense to me especially that those three projects you mentioned would be very relevant to my gosh here it is finally.

204
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,173
[SPEAKER_04]: would be relevant to our zoning work.

205
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:34,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say to that specific point and to any councilors on this committee, as research into projects continues, as councilors start to get specific on the parameters of projects outside of zoning, especially those that align with zoning, just to feel free to be in communication with me as chair of this committee.

206
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:50,365
[SPEAKER_04]: One, to keep the governing agenda updated with what we plan to work on and when, but also if they're, say, for example, green score, I think it intuitively makes a lot of sense to work on that at the same time as some, you know, developer and building standards that will be picked into our zoning code.

207
00:20:51,106 --> 00:21:00,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make sure that as the timeline for breaking zoning into parts gets solidified with our zoning consultant, we can make sure that we're scheduling these things in alignment.

208
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just add that it was super helpful.

209
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:11,949
[SPEAKER_00]: We did short-term rentals as part of the zoning recodification, so we have done that before.

210
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:17,513
[SPEAKER_00]: We took projects that had been proposed individually and put them in through the zoning process.

211
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:32,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I may make a suggestion, again, to what Councilor Callahan brought up earlier.

212
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:47,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we're going to eventually be going, we're going to collectively decide on a sequence through which to work through all of these topics comprised of zoning will decide that collectively will have a draft schedule like all of our other schedules will be amendable.

213
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that we will all have our separate version of planning and homework and research that will go into the work and the priorities that will take to the zoning discussions.

214
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:07,936
[SPEAKER_04]: If it feels helpful to Councilors, I would be happy as chair to be sort of repository for those notes, lists, lists of priorities and goals.

215
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:21,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we are going to be working on sort of, as council leadership, matching our main goals and priorities for zoning overall and bringing those to Innes Associates to help draft that sequence of zoning work to bring to this committee.

216
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:39,598
[SPEAKER_04]: If councilors feel it'd be helpful to, as they're devising lists of priorities on your own time in preparation for our meetings, I would be happy to be a repository for those ideas and then make sure that they are brought up again when we get to the relevant topics in our zoning work.

217
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:46,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on zoning right now?

218
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Priorities, questions, questions around timing?

219
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to spend a million more hours talking about it, so let's put a pin in it there.

220
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:12,837
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back to it later in this meeting if anything else occurs to Councilors or members of the public, but I'll scroll up again to the start of the section on ordinances, and we can run through that list.

221
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:25,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Councilor Tseng mentioned, a lot of our other legislative projects will align with zoning to a greater or lesser extent, and some of them won't, and that's okay too.

222
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:33,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to run quickly down the list of ordinances that are also in this committee, the Condo Conversion Ordinance, this is one that I'm leading on.

223
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We started work on this last year.

224
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:53,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal of this is to create some conditions and permitting procedures around when rental units are taken off the market by for-profit developers and turned into condos to make sure that the community recaptures some of that value that is just being realized as real estate value.

225
00:23:57,056 --> 00:24:05,259
[SPEAKER_04]: The status on that is there was a bunch of takeaways and great research questions from our last meeting, which was sometime last fall, that I have to follow up with the building commissioner about.

226
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that we can get about that quite soon and get it passed by May.

227
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have housing home rule petitions.

228
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:17,244
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few here.

229
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Real estate transfer fee, tenant first right of refusal, and rent stabilization.

230
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,727
[SPEAKER_04]: These were originally proposed

231
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:29,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I want, oh it was 20, it was 2022, we know from the paper number.

232
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:41,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the local context for when these papers were introduced to this council was when a particularly visible eviction event was happening in Medford.

233
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:54,086
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know from the community that petitioning the state for greater power to protect tenants in Medford and do what we can locally to stabilize the cost of rent is something that is important to

234
00:24:55,164 --> 00:24:56,005
[SPEAKER_04]: many people in Medford.

235
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:02,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are not ordinances, but home rule petitions that we can discuss here in this council.

236
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:07,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions on these before we move down to a fee schedule?

237
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:14,518
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears, would you like to briefly describe the fee schedule project?

238
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:16,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.

239
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I think pretty simple.

240
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the city charges fees for a variety of things.

241
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:29,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those fees are set by the council, some of them are set by departments, some of it depends on state law, some of it depends on the ordinance.

242
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think this is a three-step process.

243
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,528
[SPEAKER_00]: One, what are fees that we set?

244
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe we look at all the fees and we can say, here's the ones that we set, here's the ones that we don't.

245
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,690
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't,

246
00:25:40,166 --> 00:26:06,893
[SPEAKER_00]: say to the group that does set them it's probably time to take a look at these they haven't been updated in a while for the ones where we are the authority for setting them ask departments to submit feedback on when was the last time you believe the fee schedule was updated what are similar fees and and you know comparable communities and then we can look at those for different departments and different sections of the city and update the fee schedule to be

247
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:26,930
[SPEAKER_00]: more reflective of the cost for administering these various programs for each department as well as incentivizing the behaviors that we want to incentivize by having them and as well as making sure that we're in line with what, you know, we don't want someone

248
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:41,169
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing the street, the border from Arlington into Medford and saying, well, in Arlington, this costs $100 and in Medford, it costs $10 because A, it shouldn't be that different across the street from each other.

249
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:50,398
[SPEAKER_00]: B, quite frankly, the city of Medford will be leaving some revenue on the table and we know that there is a need for revenue to support many of our city departments.

250
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,220
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the intent here.

251
00:26:53,396 --> 00:27:09,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also in the long term, after we've done a comprehensive assessment of where we are, the goal would be that in the future, every year or two, the council would have a document that they could look back on and say, okay, we know that the fees for X, Y, and Z were updated in 2022 or 2024.

252
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:16,728
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to review it in 2026 or whenever they may want to be, whatever schedule they may want to.

253
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:20,714
[SPEAKER_00]: a future council may want to look at.

254
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:28,239
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least get that all together, because I do know, talking to a lot of departments, that their fees have not been updated in a long time.

255
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:32,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

256
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:37,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your thinking at this point that this will be a process we go through department by department?

257
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:41,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you have any other thoughts on how we might meet this out over the term?

258
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it needs to be that onerous.

259
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be kind of a starting point just

260
00:27:50,982 --> 00:28:00,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at one meeting, it could just be a quick agenda item to send a request out to all departments for the fees that they have and what they want updated.

261
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:10,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get all that information back outside of meeting, you or I or some group of the committee could compile all that information into a clear document.

262
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:18,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can have a meeting where we review it, get any recommendations from department heads, make our own recommendations, and then

263
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:24,870
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed or recommended out of this committee changes to the regular meeting to the full council.

264
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:38,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe three or four meetings over six to 12 months, depending on how quickly departments are able to get back to us with information and how many questions and recommendations we may have.

265
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:41,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great.

266
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:42,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

267
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:44,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

268
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:45,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

269
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:47,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds good to me.

270
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:59,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know of certain, like just being in City Hall, I've heard about certain ideas that are being bounced back and forth about this resolution in terms of giving us some recommendations to adjust.

271
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:07,047
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some talk that there might be some certain fees that we might need to move a little faster on just because of how

272
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:12,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Renting schedules are like leasing schedules, etc.

273
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting people, making sure that there's an education campaign before we raise some of the fees.

274
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:27,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it might be helpful for those department heads to give us a sense of how quickly, like how much of a priority certain changes are.

275
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:33,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just for me, if departments have specific plans, that's great.

276
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:34,277
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even easier.

277
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:41,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I know DPW just did a whole batch of changes because there were many fees that were just under the discretion of the commissioner.

278
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:49,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

279
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears, Councilor Tseng.

280
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:56,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like that will be pretty straightforward to dispense with, hopefully meaningful for many of our city departments.

281
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Continuing down the line, next cycling safety ordinance.

282
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:07,264
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a project that I proposed, I haven't formally proposed it, project that I have proposed to propose.

283
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal of this ordinance would be to align with the city's complete streets project and work with the DPW to see if there are some standards we can create legislatively to ensure that

284
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:34,637
[SPEAKER_04]: bike safety infrastructure projects are always considered when road renovation is already being done in the city or see what else we can do along those lines towards the value of increasing safety for all road users.

285
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:45,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We always talk about the need for more revenue, and I think this is one of the places where it is apparent.

286
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:54,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is currently lacking some funds in terms of painting bike lanes on the roads, just getting the physical paint.

287
00:30:55,385 --> 00:31:04,112
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of hiring the staff to lay down the paint on the roads, department heads have said that it's a priority for them going forward to advocate in the new budget.

288
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:07,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that we should put on our radar when we think about

289
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,157
[SPEAKER_03]: the upcoming budget.

290
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:14,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.

291
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

292
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:18,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

293
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Council Chair.

294
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:38,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that I've talked to, I know that it's been bantered around the state, but I think it's something that as we look at this topic and looking for how to fund it, I think that one of the things we might want to consider is bringing a state delegation in.

295
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:45,921
[SPEAKER_01]: and working on a statewide mandate of cyclists registering their bicycles.

296
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:53,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that fee, supporting any safety recommendations and upgrades.

297
00:31:53,384 --> 00:32:00,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So to assist with what our goals are for cycle safety.

298
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, as we know, we have probably the most

299
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:21,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if everybody had the respect of a bicyclist, I think it could make the world a lot better, but we also have, um, those rogue cyclists that tend to cross the line.

300
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:34,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I think that's what makes at times a site cycling world, a little difficult for some people to, to, um, engage with because they think that, you know, uh,

301
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:58,998
[SPEAKER_01]: the content of, bicyclists don't follow the rules, or if a car was taking a right turn, I heard this through the, this bicycle lanes is confusing because something simple as a person taking a right turn and a bicyclist cutting in behind traffic and ramming into the side of your car and then you have damage to your automobile and the person rides away.

302
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:09,091
[SPEAKER_01]: and not having an identification piece for a police report or anything to that nature.

303
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:15,539
[SPEAKER_01]: No different than how the license plates started with automobiles, but I think it's something that

304
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:37,325
[SPEAKER_01]: putting a fee to that and having an identification number, it could be beneficial for what the greater plan is, and that's more safety, more bike lanes, and where it's, you know, when we started raising fees in the community I work in, the city was in, they were an uproar for the fact that the fees were all

305
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,107
[SPEAKER_01]: was they were all increased.

306
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:50,593
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you understood that all traffic and parking fees go directly to youth programming and schools, then people don't mind.

307
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, for street sweeping, weekly street sweeping, people see the streets being swept us.

308
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we understand now, if you're going to break the law, that's what it is.

309
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:04,401
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at identified fee structure, and you're looking for something like bicycle registration,

310
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting that money directly into our roads and for safety purposes, I think it's hugely beneficial.

311
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:13,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thoughts.

312
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

313
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

314
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:24,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's also a really an evergreen reminder of how important it is in the conversation of the fee schedule more broadly.

315
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:33,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So important to be really transparent with the public about, yes, it's a revenue thing, but in service of the things that we all

316
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:46,262
[SPEAKER_04]: need and see the lack of funding and I think that really makes it a less bitter pill to swallow to realize that this revenue is going towards things that are chronically underfunded and then we'll all be happy to see better funded.

317
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:55,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of transportation, we next go to Transportation Demand Management.

318
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, would you like to give us a brief description of this project?

319
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

320
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:10,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, this is to create a program where we incentivize developers coming into Medford to provide some transport traffic alleviation of some kind.

321
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:25,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The emphasis of this is basically to try to get developers incentivize renters living there and businesses and employees who work there to use bikes and public transit where possible.

322
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,211
[SPEAKER_03]: We would develop kind of a point system in terms of like

323
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:40,433
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's extra bike parking or certain shuttles to green line stations or orange line stations, etc.

324
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all ideas that we would consider.

325
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We would essentially work with existing transit demand management authority in the area, which we already are a part of the lower mystic.

326
00:35:55,452 --> 00:36:01,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Transit management authority, and basically see how we can expand to this program.

327
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also there are already some developments in Wellington that are kind of.

328
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:19,596
[SPEAKER_03]: like in a program like this, this is basically a proposal to expand that to different zones in the city because we know development and traffic is growing across the city and not just in Wellington.

329
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:25,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Councilor Leming has been working with PDS on it.

330
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,942
[SPEAKER_03]: PDS has asked us to talk to Todd Blake as well.

331
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the ideas that Director Hunt said would be smart to tie in with zoning.

332
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We would also have to debate about how closely we align that program to Everett's program, to other programs in the state, or how much writing do we do for ourselves in Medford, whether we want to require that certain developments in certain zones take part in it, et cetera.

333
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:01,678
[SPEAKER_03]: But very open discussions.

334
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Councilor Leming is very excited to work on it too.

335
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:09,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

336
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:10,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

337
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have some proposed ordinances that I think are linked to energy disclosure and benchmarking.

338
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we also have the rental license ordinance.

339
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:28,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan, were all of these your brainchild?

340
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:35,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are definitely out of the climate adaptation and action plan.

341
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:42,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, the energy disclosure and benchmarking are kind of linked.

342
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:57,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So what other cities have done is to first start with having buildings, usually large buildings above a certain amount, have required energy disclosure.

343
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:14,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that, after they've been doing that for a few years, then the city can benchmark certain energy goals and have fines for buildings that are not meeting those goals.

344
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:27,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is definitely part of the same, it would be part of, I believe, the same ordinance that would have one thing for a few years and then benchmarking part of it for the next few years.

345
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:29,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

346
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes that linkage makes a lot of sense.

347
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:42,288
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on this topic, let me scroll back down.

348
00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:44,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You could also speak to the rental licensing if you would like.

349
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

350
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:54,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to note, I think we would be good at some point soon, not necessarily right this minute, especially since the city clerk has reminded me that the Public Works Committee is beginning at 7 p.m.

351
00:38:57,443 --> 00:39:10,455
[SPEAKER_04]: As these conversations continue on, as we start to get a sequence on paper for the zoning timeline, it would be great to start drafting some goal start dates and end dates for those ordinances, because I don't think we have them yet.

352
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So open to hearing thoughts on that at any time, inside or outside of the meeting.

353
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:19,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Cheng?

354
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is so apparently the person who wrote Boston's ordinance is working for metric now.

355
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:28,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Our climate planner, Brenda.

356
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Brenda Pike.

357
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:38,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So she is definitely someone who we should talk to when it comes to these ideas.

358
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:47,216
[SPEAKER_03]: She's also said apparently the state is doing a lot of stuff on this and so might make sense to see how we coordinate with that.

359
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:48,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We should also

360
00:39:50,638 --> 00:40:11,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the PDS offices told me at least that it might be a good use of our time to also send a testimony to the State House on these issues if possible, and to also work with surrounding municipalities to make sure that, you know,

361
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:23,869
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of all working together and not kind of creating a situation where some of the businesses flee, but otherwise the office is very supportive of the idea.

362
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:26,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

363
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:27,113
[SPEAKER_07]: You just reminded me.

364
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:35,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I also had a talk with Brenda and Alicia about this and heard that the state may be working on something like this.

365
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,803
[SPEAKER_07]: The state's version will only apply to very large buildings.

366
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:45,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I think our first step is really to investigate, number one, what the state is working on and number two,

367
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:55,131
[SPEAKER_07]: how quickly that might be done, because being someone who actually knows quite a lot about how state politics works, I know that it could be 10 or 20 years.

368
00:40:55,491 --> 00:41:01,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to understand whether they're actually going to accomplish something or if this is just something that is, you know, quote unquote, being worked on.

369
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And then number three, if whatever law they are working on is even going to have any impact in Medford, given the size of most of our buildings.

370
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:20,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, then we want to consider what could we do that might be like a slightly smaller building size or how we could have impact.

371
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:25,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super passionate about this because two thirds of our emissions are from buildings.

372
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:30,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is really and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings.

373
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:35,359
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a half a percent gain in buildings per year, maybe, maybe less.

374
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:41,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So we cannot affect this carbon emissions through new buildings and new construction.

375
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:47,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's new construction on old buildings, but if we really want to get at our carbon emissions, this is something we'll have to consider.

376
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:53,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

377
00:41:53,412 --> 00:42:04,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an exciting project, and it makes sense that our first step should be to investigate the extent to which a possible state legislation might be relevant here, or if we should not bother.

378
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,101
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting for that to become relevant.

379
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:12,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move quickly through the rest of these projects.

380
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:17,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Rental licensing, would you like a quick description?

381
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:18,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I can speak to that.

382
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:24,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically something that will allow us to reach both some of our climate goals as well as some of our affordable housing goals.

383
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:31,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It just means that if you're a landlord renting units that you would have to register with the city.

384
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:32,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty simple.

385
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:33,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

386
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

387
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another idea that PDS was very, very excited about.

388
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: They suggested that we actually move this up in our governing agenda timeline to, like, very soon to start talking about it, at least with city staff pretty soon, because we have a new building commissioner coming in.

389
00:42:53,845 --> 00:43:03,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And that building commissioner is trained in a software called CitizenServe, which basically runs training modules like what we would use for rental licensing.

390
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:12,250
[SPEAKER_03]: for landlords, and so getting that on the agenda of the building commissioner early is their advice.

391
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:21,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then we would also have to talk to the Board of Health and PDS about it, but people are very excited about this.

392
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:30,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are some folks who recently left the health department that are very gung-ho about it, but yeah, I think if we can move this up in the timeline, that'd be great.

393
00:43:34,264 --> 00:43:38,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in those discussions, did they feel it should be independent of the zoning reform?

394
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:40,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Tseng?

395
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, through you.

396
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:45,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the PDS staff feel like it should be independent of zoning reform?

397
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:47,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.

398
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:48,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this one, yes.

399
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:51,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and doing it sooner could make sense.

400
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It could help with the good landlord tax credit too, because we're going to need some set of information.

401
00:43:58,586 --> 00:43:59,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're licensing everybody,

402
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:01,993
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with a lot of things.

403
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:06,217
[SPEAKER_00]: It even eventually helps with residential exemption if we ever go down that route.

404
00:44:06,898 --> 00:44:10,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It would also help with the implementation of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.

405
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:18,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of great reasons to, yeah, which has been, I think, a major challenge in disseminating that.

406
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of great reasons to prioritize.

407
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:21,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

408
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:25,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving right along, just in the interest of time.

409
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:31,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, Councilor Tseng, would you like to speak to pesticide regulations, blasting, green score?

410
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can do all this pretty quickly.

411
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:39,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Pesticide regulations is basically just in terms of regulating what

412
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:53,431
[SPEAKER_03]: what the city and business owners can use in terms of landscaping, we would have to basically see what exactly we can do at the local level and to make sure that the city is ready to be in compliance with it as well.

413
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:54,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But that one's

414
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:56,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's relatively simple.

415
00:44:57,755 --> 00:45:02,099
[SPEAKER_03]: On blasting and earth removal, PDS has already done research into it.

416
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:10,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They've collected the six ordinances from around the state and kind of picked out what they think can be implemented.

417
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:17,290
[SPEAKER_03]: They have sent it to the fire for feedback and very soon they're going to send it to us to work on.

418
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:42,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and for context about blasting and earth removal, that's basically just like projects like on Winthrop, where people are removing big chunks of earth, and we want to make sure that we can at the very least be able to tell neighbors when things are going to happen, but also have a system where there is some sort of permitting so we can kind of

419
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulate this behavior on the green score.

420
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:47,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the descriptions and goals kind of speak more to it.

421
00:45:48,356 --> 00:45:58,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's a lot of it's about stormwater management and making sure that Developers are kind of in line with best practices when it comes to stormwater negotiations.

422
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:05,721
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that Director hunts said should definitely be in the zoning process and

423
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we as a council would just need to bring this up when we talk about zoning.

424
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's those three.

425
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

426
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:20,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

427
00:46:23,268 --> 00:46:27,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like I said up top, we also have some ongoing projects.

428
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:37,466
[SPEAKER_04]: that are under our jurisdiction for ongoing engagement oversight, including the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting, and Signs, chaired by Councilors Scarpelli.

429
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:40,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe we're having a meeting next week, Tuesday.

430
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:41,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

431
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:42,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

432
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:50,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be a subcommittee that meets frequently and as needed to go over those sign applications.

433
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have some projects in here under ongoing oversight.

434
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:04,285
[SPEAKER_04]: energy efficiency retrofits for existing buildings, transit signal priority.

435
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:09,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple minutes if Councilors want to give a brief overview of those projects.

436
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:17,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure this energy retrofits for existing buildings is really right out of the climate action adaptation plan.

437
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be something that the planning department is doing this year.

438
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe started last year.

439
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:27,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're actually going to start this year.

440
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we just want to have our eyes on it and ensure that that effort is moving forward.

441
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:35,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

442
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:40,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, would you like to briefly describe transit signal priority?

443
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:58,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, transit signal priority is basically when you modify traffic signals to basically implement a strategy where we cause less delay to transit vehicles like buses to make sure that

444
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:05,717
[SPEAKER_03]: people can rely better on bus schedules and that buses can travel quicker to incentivize people to take public transit.

445
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:22,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, there's also appetite for this in City Hall, but the big problem, as always, is revenue, making sure that we have the money to buy the physical infrastructure we need to modify traffic lights.

446
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:24,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tsenghia.

447
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:38,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand from my conversations with Director Blake that this is a project for which there is a ton of appetite in the city, and we're just lacking some of those crucial millions of dollars to do exactly what we want to do, what we know constituents would love.

448
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:43,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure that there's ways that we can collaborate to move the ball forward this term on that.

449
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for bringing that forward.

450
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:45,661
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears?

451
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:50,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, madam president, if I could just comment on the 2 papers in committee.

452
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:57,125
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the 1st, 1, I think we had a number of issues in my 1st term.

453
00:48:58,006 --> 00:49:02,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Around health and safety issues for tenants, some code related, some not related some.

454
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:10,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Tenants unions and property managers and conditions that were presented to the council and photographs that were just not acceptable.

455
00:49:10,736 --> 00:49:18,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of what we're hearing around rental licensing and the sanitarians and the building inspectors wanting a little bit more.

456
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:20,439
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth in that process.

457
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:24,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that paper and committee could align really well with the rental licensing.

458
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,743
[SPEAKER_04]: What paper is that, sorry?

459
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:31,287
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 21-070 update on complaints and inspection process for reporting health and safety issues for tenants.

460
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:33,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

461
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:38,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 21-543, there's something that's not in here that I don't know if we want to go down this road.

462
00:49:38,293 --> 00:49:39,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we do, maybe we don't.

463
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:41,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of more leaning in this direction.

464
00:49:42,536 --> 00:49:44,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Scarpelli will remember an outdoor

465
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:51,261
[SPEAKER_00]: committee of the whole meeting that we had the Saturday before the 2021 election.

466
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:55,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some on-site meetings at Irving Street and Brooks.

467
00:49:55,924 --> 00:49:59,406
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had an on-site meeting at Cotting West North and Auburn.

468
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:01,807
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty well attended.

469
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:14,534
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 30 people were there at that intersection where you have a one-way and you have two one-ways meeting and then a two-way street that goes like this right by.

470
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:26,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole Foods, Walkling Court, the Mystic River, it's a very high traffic area, but not high traffic just for cars, high traffic for pedestrians, strollers, bicyclists.

471
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:29,060
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really highly walkable area.

472
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,342
[SPEAKER_00]: It is essentially a walking destination to the grocery store for a whole neighborhood.

473
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:52,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd Blake came out, he presented a whole fantastic series of short-term upgrades that you can put at the site that didn't require this intensive curbing, et cetera, et cetera, would have prevented cars from going down a street, Cotting Street one way, much more effectively.

474
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:58,969
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this would have been at the cost of, I believe, one moving, not even eliminating, moving one parking spot.

475
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:06,034
[SPEAKER_00]: That was honestly not even frequently according to, I believe, Mr. Blake went out several times, it's not often occupied.

476
00:51:07,075 --> 00:51:14,500
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that work from the director, from this council, from the 30 residents who showed up and said, hey, this is a great idea, and all of that went to the traffic commission.

477
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:19,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the traffic commission, none of the people who came to our meeting showed up at the traffic commission.

478
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:28,090
[SPEAKER_00]: One person who would have been affected by the moving of the parking spot showed up at the traffic commission, and the entire thing was put on the table and hasn't been touched in two years.

479
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:31,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little bit of a,

480
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:47,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest and axe the grind on this one because I think there's a lot of people in that neighborhood who would feel a lot better off with a little bit tighter of a traffic pattern, a little bit shorter sidewalks, paint based fixes that would make that entire intersection better.

481
00:51:49,085 --> 00:51:55,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping the traffic commission will reconsider, but I think it brings up a bigger question that we may want to consider in this committee.

482
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,676
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge agenda.

483
00:51:57,137 --> 00:52:02,906
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be worth adding in this term, but maybe it is, which is that this council does have the authority to.

484
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:09,171
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially dissolve the traffic commission and establish a new traffic commission by ordinance.

485
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:13,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Pursuant to Massachusetts General Law, the traffic commission was passed.

486
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:18,201
[SPEAKER_00]: The current traffic commission exists as a special act of the legislature from 1958.

487
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:24,928
[SPEAKER_00]: The two-thirds vote of this council can dissolve it and can establish a traffic commission with different membership.

488
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to many members of the right now.

489
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,492
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic commission includes the chief of police.

490
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:32,133
[SPEAKER_00]: He cannot designate someone else.

491
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:42,297
[SPEAKER_00]: The director of planning who cannot designate someone else, the director of public works who cannot designate someone else, and then two resident appointments who are not confirmed by this council.

492
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,958
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty rare traffic commission.

493
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:52,342
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at similarly constructed traffic commissions across the region, I know for a fact that it is not

494
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:53,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be.

495
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:59,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly convenient for the members of the traffic commission who are the high level executives of major departments of the city to also be serving in that role.

496
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:04,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Um or at least serving in it at all times, no matter what, without really the ability to

497
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:19,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we get down this road in a few months after having further conversations, what a different traffic commission could look like in Somerville.

498
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:24,740
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a member of the council, the head of the traffic and parking committee serves on the traffic commission.

499
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a direct democratic line.

500
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:38,150
[SPEAKER_00]: around traffic and parking, which currently doesn't exist, without it being all the council and then traffic and parking becoming political decisions and not decisions by experts.

501
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:46,035
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, just want to put that out there as an example of something that a lot of people worked really hard on that most of the people in the neighborhood supported at least a version of.

502
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:53,521
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't go anywhere because of how the current structure of the Traffic Commission and how it takes public input.

503
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,402
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is working.

504
00:53:55,642 --> 00:54:14,352
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am, I am hopeful that we will kind of maybe consider something like that, especially given that most of the folks and stakeholders involved, I think would like to see some sort of reform and have a traffic commission that wasn't written by state legislature legislators in 1958.

505
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:18,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So just my last plug for the day.

506
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:29,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you president bears I think, and I appreciate the framework of that comments in the context that we have more than enough in this current governing agenda to work on at this committee this term at the same time.

507
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:35,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, taking into account the perspective that you just shared other anecdotes from the committee.

508
00:54:38,314 --> 00:54:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: current structure of the traffic commission with mandatory members as opposed to a more representative model.

509
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:54,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It strikes me as something that's certainly at least worth discussing other models that might make more sense for our community regardless of whether this committee decides to pursue that this term.

510
00:54:56,785 --> 00:55:03,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that we've done our speed run overview of everything that we will definitely fully complete this term.

511
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to my fellow councillors for that.

512
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:28,170
[SPEAKER_04]: For any final comments from my fellow Councilors, I would just like to invite everyone, like I said, when we were finishing up our short conversation about zoning, if Councilors, as we're preparing for our sequential digestion of the

513
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: zoning topic if Councilors are so moved to submit to me top line priorities for our discussion that we can then batch into categories with the consultant and with planning staff or more nitty gritty versions of those lists.

514
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:53,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Please feel free to forward those along to myself as chair ahead of time where we can store those for the appropriate meetings when those topics come up.

515
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:55,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also ask

516
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:04,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilors, if there are any projects that are in this committee, once they've been proposed, if they don't currently have start and end goal dates, please do submit those to me.

517
00:56:04,818 --> 00:56:08,441
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be important as we do the monthly updating of the governing agenda.

518
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:12,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final comments?

519
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:19,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also just move that the TDM, Transportation Demand Management, and the green score be moved under the

520
00:56:20,774 --> 00:56:31,401
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning reform project, and let's just, we can do that now and not have to worry about coming back around to it, but make it clear that those are two items that we want on the agenda for the zoning.

521
00:56:33,962 --> 00:56:39,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Transportation demand management and the green score.

522
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:43,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there another energy-related paper that should be in?

523
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:47,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say benchmarking or energy disclosure should be under there?

524
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was discussions with PDS.

525
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:52,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just the ones.

526
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:55,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are other things to do with that before we look at any zoning.

527
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:59,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to look at the state legislation and everything else.

528
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

529
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a motion from President Bears to move transit demand management and green score under the zoning paper.

530
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:09,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

531
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:10,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

532
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,893
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, all in favor?

533
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:16,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

534
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:17,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All opposed?

535
00:57:18,534 --> 00:57:19,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

536
00:57:21,389 --> 00:57:22,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final comments from councilors?

537
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

538
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:24,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I move to adjourn.

539
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn from Councilor Callahan, seconded by President Bears.

540
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

541
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

542
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:30,475
[SPEAKER_04]: All opposed?

543
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:31,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is adjourned.

544
00:57:31,676 --> 00:57:31,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
