And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,721
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:32,802
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,303
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,730
All right, thanks so much for being with me today.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,812
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:59,176
So I'm Maureen Fallanceer, and I'm a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, clinical social worker, and also a meditation teacher.

12
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,457
And my pronouns are she and her.

13
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,138
All right, thanks, Maureen.

14
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:10,100
So if you don't mind, I know you have moved away from the area, but hopefully you can answer this question for us.

15
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:14,601
What is your favorite place to eat in Medford, and what do you like to eat there?

16
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:23,044
OK, so my sister lives in Medford, so I get to come here and visit and taste, get little culinary taste tours.

17
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,964
But I would have to say Colleen's is my favorite.

18
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:35,316
part of the reason I know there's like great sandwiches and things like that but I always come home for mocha chip ice cream.

19
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,748
I grew up on it in Brigham's and it's like oh yeah I always have to come and get some mocha chip so yeah.

20
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,150
Well, thank you.

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:54,239
And so we're here to talk about a few things, but we do know that you're coming to Medford to the library in January to talk about your book.

22
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,464
I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit of background about you, kind of how you arrived at this place where you decided to write this book.

23
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,247
And yeah, tell us a little bit more about what it's about.

24
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:09,181
Yeah, so the book is called Reimagining Success, Manifesting Happiness and Fulfillment.

25
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:13,504
And my husband and I, he's a psychiatrist.

26
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:18,667
And we both trained here in Boston and then moved to Colorado where we raised our kids.

27
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:32,755
And we were working both together in private practice work and with Department of Human Services and school organizations, lots of different interface with children and families and adults and doing that work.

28
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:44,743
And we, you know, there's, there's endless need, there's endless need when it comes to working with people in struggling situations, right.

29
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:52,448
And there's an old story that a teacher told me, we live in the southwest of Colorado, and a teacher told me a story called the river story.

30
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,430
I don't know if your listeners are familiar with it.

31
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,053
But it's a story about how two friends are walking up a path along a river.

32
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,833
and they see some kids drowning.

33
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,534
And they jump in the river and start pulling the kids out.

34
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:04,834
And it's great.

35
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:08,456
And then all of a sudden, they realize there's more kids coming, and there's more kids coming.

36
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:10,657
And they're pulling out, and they're getting exhausted.

37
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,237
And it's endless.

38
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:13,438
It's absolutely endless.

39
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:17,519
And all of a sudden, one of the friends gets out of the river and starts walking away.

40
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,320
And his friend screams at him and says, where are you going?

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,161
There's all these kids.

42
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:21,641
And he said,

43
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,165
I'm going up river to find out how these kids are falling in the river.

44
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:32,010
And so when you do a lot of direct service work, after a few years, you're like, how did this happen?

45
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,310
Right?

46
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,613
You start going up river to try to figure out why is everybody falling in the river?

47
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:42,777
And that's what my husband, Mark, and I ended up doing was starting looking at what are the patterns?

48
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,358
Why are people falling in the river?

49
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,099
What's going on?

50
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,460
Is there any way to stop that?

51
00:03:47,180 --> 00:04:03,425
help people either not fall in the river or can we teach them how to climb out so that they're not coming down where we're seeing them after years and years of you know falling in and chaos and so um so we started this work where we started kind of mapping

52
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,147
this idea that people had about living a successful life.

53
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:10,909
Because a lot of people would come in our office and say, no, I'm successful.

54
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:11,969
I have this job.

55
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,490
I have, you know, three cars.

56
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,332
I have whatever I might have, 2.4 children, you know, whatever it might be.

57
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,173
But unlucky 0.4.

58
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:19,874
Exactly, right?

59
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:27,379
And it was like, but then some area of their life was a mess, right?

60
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:35,364
They're like, I got a drinking problem, or I have anxiety, and I'm up every night, and I can't make it go away, even though supposedly, I'm a successful person, what's wrong here?

61
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:40,027
And so we started breaking down, where's this breaking down?

62
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:40,807
What's happening here?

63
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:47,892
And what we came up with is that human beings have seven domains of functioning, we call them the building blocks.

64
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:50,874
And so it's your psychological functioning, your emotional,

65
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:58,585
your cognitive functioning, your spiritual functioning even, your social relational intimacy issues.

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:05,949
And so of these seven areas, supposedly successful people are coming in having difficulty.

67
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,673
And what we could see was, wow, they were really successful at like two areas maybe, like really gifted maybe even, right?

68
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,194
Like I'm great at math or I'm great at this, I'm a great

69
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,854
you know, I'm great at programming or whatever.

70
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:21,196
They had something they were great at, a couple of things.

71
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:24,038
And they were okay at three of them, let's say.

72
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:29,141
But then there were like two at the bottom that they were really drowning and struggling in.

73
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:39,088
And what we found was that when we looked at their whole story, that actually the two bottom things were dragging their entire life down.

74
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:43,771
So people had this concept that if I'm successful in one or two areas,

75
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:45,679
well then life will be great.

76
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,585
And what we were seeing is no, because you're successful at one or two areas, and yet you're being really pulled down by this other issue.

77
00:05:53,725 --> 00:06:02,032
Like it might be alcoholism, it might be anxiety, it might be drug abuse, it might be I'm addicted to something, gambling, something like that.

78
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:03,893
Or I can't do intimacy.

79
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:06,215
I'm great at work, I come home at night,

80
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,377
I can't do intimacy with my family.

81
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:16,266
So what became clear to us was that these two lower domains were really pulling everything down.

82
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:26,136
And if we could help people get those two domains up to just a level of competence, just not dragging us in the mud, then people could start realizing

83
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:49,897
a more successful life or a more fulfilling life and what we came to define a successful life as was not like what you bought and what you owned and not those kinds of things but are you living your true nature you know your authentic nature who you really are and are you living a meaningful and fulfilling life for you whatever that means so that became our definition of success

84
00:06:51,038 --> 00:07:02,646
And by bringing up these lower two domains, we started realizing that people had a chance to actually realize a meaningful and fulfilling life for themselves because they weren't being undone by that.

85
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:04,207
Does that make sense?

86
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,407
It makes sense to me.

87
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:06,268
Yeah.

88
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,008
Yeah.

89
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:07,289
Yeah.

90
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,411
And so how like, so yeah, how do you do this?

91
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,373
Or like, how can people kind of learn more about how this works?

92
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:19,324
Yeah, so then it became, okay, let's look at why those are breaking down.

93
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:25,937
And so when we started looking at those domains that were struggling, what we found was that

94
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:35,091
pretty much consistently, people had some kind of trauma or pain or wound in those domains, right?

95
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:43,614
And so, and some of it was big trauma, and some of it was like little life trauma kind of stuff.

96
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:47,255
So I'll give an example, like we might meet somebody who said, you know,

97
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,116
they're not functioning very well in the cognitive domain.

98
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:55,256
They have a hard time reading, they're dyslexic, or it could be anything.

99
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:56,737
Or they just shut down from school.

100
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:59,917
They're like, I hated school, and I just don't do it.

101
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:03,238
And yet, that cognitive functioning is getting in their way at work now.

102
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:07,739
And they perceive of themselves as somebody who is stupid, or they can't learn.

103
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,700
And when we go back and say, well, where'd you get that story from?

104
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:20,516
You know, we would find, oh, you could deepen somebody down and find that they had a whole story in there about something like, I'll just make it up.

105
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:30,839
You know, in fifth grade, I was reading my book report in front of Miss McGuire's class, and she yelled at me, and the kids laughed at me, and I just said, I'm never doing this again, right?

106
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,720
Or the kid who strikes out at baseball and says, baseball is stupid.

107
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,421
I'm never doing this again.

108
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:40,842
And so everybody had these stories of pain and shutdown in them.

109
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:52,815
So what we started doing was using, I started bringing together the mindfulness training I have and the psychology training I have to help people mindfully work their way down to that.

110
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,237
Like what is that wound?

111
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,718
What is that yeah but?

112
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,721
What is that no that's there?

113
00:08:58,341 --> 00:08:58,782
And then

114
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:22,393
showing them how they could actually release that old trauma that old wound and clear their system and come back to kind of like their what we call your essential nature it's kind of like who you were as a kid before you got shut down right it's like when we were little we'd go outside and play outside of trauma I know some people really had trauma as children but

115
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:27,716
Most people have some memories of going outside as a kid, getting away from the grown-ups.

116
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,497
And then there's this freedom, right?

117
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:35,140
This freedom to just explore and be me, and young kids have that, right?

118
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,083
And so that's what we're helping people do, is come back to their essential nature, who you are underneath.

119
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:57,135
all the abuts and the nos and the fear and all that stuff, so that you actually can get back on track to realize your potential, to live out your dreams and goals, you know, the things that make your life meaningful.

120
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:09,938
And so we came up with a protocol for how people could do this using some mindfulness, releasing this tension out of their body, coming back to their essential nature, and then building skill, right?

121
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,258
So it's,

122
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:14,622
It's like if you, let's say you'd love to learn how to swim, but you're scared of water.

123
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:18,265
You know, chances are we go back and go, oh, there's a memory back there.

124
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,887
I almost drowned when I was five years old.

125
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,167
Right.

126
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:26,452
And we go ahead and release that skill and get you back in touch with your essential nature.

127
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:29,094
And somebody goes, oh, my God, I really love the water.

128
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:30,376
I really do want to swim.

129
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:30,636
Right.

130
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,296
Which is lovely.

131
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,439
But you still have to go take swim lessons probably.

132
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,142
It's not like you just release your fear and suddenly you know how to do something.

133
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:39,463
You still have to cultivate it.

134
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:44,267
So we say that our true nature is rediscovered and cultivated.

135
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,289
Rediscovered and cultivated.

136
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,270
Who are you really?

137
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,611
Who's your true nature?

138
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:49,752
And

139
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:54,054
how do you cultivate that so that you can actually get back on track where you want to be?

140
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:55,755
Which is really fun.

141
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:56,175
Yeah.

142
00:10:56,215 --> 00:11:01,717
Well, and it sounds like the way that you're talking about it now, it has very personal benefit, right?

143
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:10,240
So I'm realizing my potential, what I want to be, what I want to do, being able to remove some of maybe those internal blockages to be able to do that.

144
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:14,002
I can imagine, but maybe you can explain better how

145
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:23,146
this would benefit like a community or how like if we were to work on this just generally how it could also have like that maybe ripple effect into it.

146
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,527
Oh yeah, beautiful.

147
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:29,050
So I love that part because I do want to help develop communities with this, right?

148
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:44,018
So part of what happens in community is that when people come together for a shared experience, they don't realize they're bringing all this conditioning of their own, of their old pain, their old fears, their old what ifs, yeah buts, right?

149
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,501
And so everybody comes back together or comes together with a great intention.

150
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,685
And then we start grinding with each other around, well, that doesn't feel comfortable to me.

151
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,267
Well, that doesn't feel comfortable to me.

152
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:55,587
Right.

153
00:11:55,667 --> 00:12:08,137
So in this work, it allows us to actually release the personal edge we have and come back to that deeper nature, our deeper values where we do care about community.

154
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:15,179
Often what I find as a therapist is that we have big, beautiful, open hearts until we're afraid.

155
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,982
And as soon as we're afraid, doors start shutting and it's like me, mine, your other, I'm not in this.

156
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,703
So I'll give you an example.

157
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:35,086
I was working with a group and they had done a DEI training, diversity, equity and inclusion training, and they really wanted to diversify their

158
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:36,586
I'll say a board.

159
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,947
They wanted to diversify the board.

160
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,787
But a year later, they actually weren't any more diversified.

161
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:43,828
And so- Classic story.

162
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:44,708
Yeah, right?

163
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:45,748
And they were like, what's up?

164
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,569
We paid for this expensive training.

165
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:48,329
Everybody took it.

166
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:49,209
How come we're not there?

167
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,430
And so I came in and just worked with this group.

168
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,111
And I said, so let me just ask a simple question.

169
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,091
Everybody close your eyes.

170
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,711
Let's get mindful for just a second.

171
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:05,133
And just notice what happens if I say, so imagine half this board is now people of color, LGBTQIA people.

172
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:21,234
Notice what happens and I could see people like like contract right and it's like so let's work with that let's work with that contraction that happens and everybody did it on their own we didn't share it wasn't it was all private work everybody did private work.

173
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,797
But at the end, I said, well, does anybody want to share their experience?

174
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:27,677
They don't have to, but does anybody want to?

175
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:31,759
And actually, the leader of the group said, yeah, actually, I want to share mine.

176
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,120
And which I thought was great leadership.

177
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,323
And he said, what was interesting was, I couldn't believe it when you helped me deepen down, I found an old fear I had from when I was 12 years old.

178
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:45,544
And it was an exchange that I had.

179
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:48,765
with a black gentleman and he said, nothing bad happened.

180
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:53,867
He said he bumped into me at a movie theater in line and he said, but I got really scared.

181
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,167
He was really tall and I got really, really scared.

182
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:04,190
And he said, and all of a sudden I realized I had formed a belief that I had formed a belief that black, this black man is scary.

183
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,971
And he said, and I had no idea that was in there.

184
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,692
And he said, until you asked us to, like, reflect on that contraction.

185
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:18,455
And when he released it, he got back in touch with his own essential nature, he got back in touch with his heart.

186
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:23,877
And he said, in that moment, thinking about the board being diversified was exciting.

187
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,357
Like, I was joyful.

188
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,838
I was like, Oh, my God, yeah, but let's do it now.

189
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,278
Like, how do we make it happen now?

190
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:37,261
And so it's things like that, that we don't realize that we have these, I call them formation, sometimes their inner child, like you got a inner four year old

191
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:42,303
is freaking out or an inner 15-year-old is pissed off, you know, we all have these parts.

192
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:46,705
And we don't realize how much they actually drive our behavior.

193
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:54,988
And so this work is around how do we get in touch with the limits of that, the things that are limiting us, the fears or whatever that might be, the

194
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,350
The doubts, things like that.

195
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,652
How do we get in touch with that?

196
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:06,681
And then release that so I can come back to my ground, come back to my centered groundness and go, this is who I am without my fear.

197
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:08,963
And I think when communities do that.

198
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:14,706
then that's when they remember, oh yeah, my heart is open to everybody.

199
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:18,967
If it's not, chances are there's a doubt or a fear or something coming up.

200
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:20,007
Does that make sense?

201
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:26,048
It does, and I think for folks that are listening and are like, why are we talking about this on a Medford podcast?

202
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:35,590
I do think it's very relevant to the way that our community is sort of in crisis right now, where I think fear is the base of a lot of it.

203
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,231
It's like, how are we relating to our neighbors?

204
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,953
like making decisions as a community.

205
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,795
How are we deciding what our shared values are?

206
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:44,658
And I do think that fear comes up a lot for folks.

207
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:46,339
And I see it, right?

208
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,946
I see like when people have conversations about different changes that they're seeing in the city or changes that they want, or like who's making the decisions, who isn't.

209
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,388
I think that fear comes up a lot.

210
00:15:55,488 --> 00:16:01,174
And fear generally like throughout our country right now about like, what's happening?

211
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,135
What's going to happen next?

212
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:03,335
What are we going to lose?

213
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:04,496
What are we going to gain?

214
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:08,257
Like, yeah, so I think it feels very relevant.

215
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,418
Yeah, I think so.

216
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:19,262
And I think so knowing, you know, one taking accountability for that, if I'm shut down to somebody, I probably have some doubt or fear about this person or about my experience with this person.

217
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,483
And owning that is mine, you know.

218
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:27,505
And then the other piece that comes up is in terms of

219
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,232
That fear often then keeps us in a bubble, right?

220
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:37,674
And so if I'm afraid of those kind of people, then I don't associate with them.

221
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:39,935
I stay in my bubble of friends.

222
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,517
I stay in my bubble of what's known to me, right?

223
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:50,581
And the problem with that is that when we're in that kind of bubble, we start what's called othering, right?

224
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,502
There's us and them, right?

225
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:57,124
Instead of expanding that bubble to be more inclusive to,

226
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:58,884
All of us belong.

227
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,565
All of us belong.

228
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:05,346
And so to me, how do we personally get through that?

229
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,728
It's by releasing whatever fear we're bringing to that moment.

230
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,428
That's what's going to empower us.

231
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:14,729
It also empowers us to have our voice, right?

232
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,290
A lot of people have beautiful ideas about the world.

233
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,172
And they want to stand up and speak about them.

234
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,233
And they're terrified to because I'm afraid of rejection.

235
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,415
I'm afraid of shame, I'm afraid of whatever.

236
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:33,480
And I think about like, you know, the way it is, the world is right now, it's it's in a lot of upheaval right now.

237
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,803
And, and people have good ideas about how we could attend to it.

238
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:42,639
But you have to have that groundedness in yourself, right?

239
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,162
And a lot of times I'll hear people say things like, oh, speak even if your voice shakes.

240
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:50,105
And yeah, I think that's a good thing.

241
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:54,008
But I would much rather help somebody figure out

242
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:58,200
how to release that fear so that your voice isn't even shaking.

243
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,721
So that you're actually just really centered and clear.

244
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,122
And you're like, you know what?

245
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,063
I'm not trying to be difficult here.

246
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,925
I'm just trying to include everybody.

247
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,286
Something like that, right?

248
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,007
Yeah, sounds lovely.

249
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:18,911
And so people can learn more about your book at the library, and then you want to talk about your training?

250
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:30,901
Yeah, so the book is called Reimagining Success, and it's available on things like bookshop.org if you like supporting independent bookstores.

251
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:35,705
And then yes, you can get it in other places, like those big places.

252
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,206
The evil empire.

253
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:42,309
Yes, and there's also, there's also an audio version of the book.

254
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:48,532
So if you're somebody who doesn't, I did that for I had a lot of clients who said they had dyslexia and things like that.

255
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,433
And so I did an audio version for them.

256
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:52,374
And so you can listen to it.

257
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,236
And it has the mindfulness piece, which is nice.

258
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:58,758
So it has some exercises that you can listen to that are that are helpful.

259
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,020
And so there's that.

260
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,400
And then

261
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:20,745
Part of what I'm doing is I came home to promote a training that I'm going to start January 2025, so it's coming up this January, and it's actually a training for therapists that might be interested in learning how to do this work, how to show people how to release their own stress, their own

262
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:32,840
pain and fear, even trauma, it even works for trauma, and then help them get grounded in this essential nature so that they have their strength, they have their seed going forward.

263
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,465
But it's also available to people that I consider in healing and leadership roles.

264
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:47,108
So right now we have a training going on in the southwest and I would say half that training is filled with therapists and the other half are people who are in healing or leadership roles.

265
00:19:47,208 --> 00:20:00,491
So for instance we have somebody who is part of an NGO who does global development work and for her it really helps her get her center and her voice when she's out there in the world working with a lot of chaos on the global scale.

266
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,131
So it's good for that.

267
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:07,372
It helps with burnout if you're in one of those jobs where you're doing a lot of caretaking and

268
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:13,256
you're just like, oh my goodness, it's, you know, as the river story says, it never ends.

269
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:14,277
It never ends.

270
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,778
And we don't have any resources.

271
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,040
Like, how does one meet this?

272
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,984
And, and when people get in touch with this essential nature, what I tell them is, it's like you become oceanic.

273
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,567
And yes, that might be a 90 foot rogue wave out there.

274
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,028
But the ocean's bigger than the wave, right?

275
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:30,549
The ocean's

276
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,590
aren't bothered by waves, right?

277
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,551
So it's a way of like really finding this deep centering in yourself.

278
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:42,253
So that training will start in January and it's an in-person training, which is really sweet.

279
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,635
Six months, it's a six weekend, six weekends.

280
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:54,878
And the point of it is to have it be experiential where people get to do their own release, where people learn how to facilitate with other people.

281
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,840
If you're a therapist, for instance, and you're doing therapy work.

282
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:09,608
But also to create a cohort of people in the community in this area saying, we all know each other, we lean on each other, we've got each other, we all know this work.

283
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,991
And we've got this center of refuge within ourselves.

284
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,292
And when I think about coming into 2025,

285
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:22,477
It sounds like a great idea to like create a group of people that are like, we know how to deal with stress.

286
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:31,222
Well and like I mean I think that mindfulness like we didn't really go deeply into like describing what it is and I think some people have some understanding of it and.

287
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:50,458
I think sometimes people lump it in with like meditation and like yeah there's definitely like an overlap there but I do think finding something in a time that feels like so chaotic and out of our control to like be centered to have at least some control over your own kind of well-being and mental health is

288
00:21:50,898 --> 00:22:11,681
is really helpful and like i will say that you and i did practice you practice this with me a little bit and and i was like very surprised as somebody who can be skeptical about these things it was like really powerful um so i mean definitely recommend it professionally and also personally um but yeah i think like a lot of people especially in january 2025 are going to be looking for a way

289
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:20,100
to have some have some sense of control or some thing that they can do to feel empowered or centered or grounded.

290
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,401
And this is, I feel like a great option.

291
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:30,565
Yeah, and what's beautiful about this is, you know, a lot of times people will use mindfulness to focus their mind on something like their breath or something like that.

292
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:34,588
And by doing that, you do calm your system, which is beautiful.

293
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:45,337
But oftentimes, as a meditation teacher, I'll hear people say, but what's wrong with me, I got up off the cushion, or, you know, and then I yelled at my dog five minutes later, I'm a bad meditator.

294
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:50,161
And what I tell people is, there's two different ways to use mindfulness.

295
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,962
One is where we're calming the system.

296
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:52,923
And that's beautiful.

297
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:53,543
And that helps.

298
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,145
And that is so so helpful.

299
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:59,108
But the other piece is where we're releasing tension out of the body.

300
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:04,506
And that's where we're using our mindfulness to release the anxiety, to release the heat, to release the pain.

301
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:11,229
And that's where you get the emptying that then allows you to feel more stable for longer periods of time.

302
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,009
Does that make sense?

303
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:12,209
Yeah.

304
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,030
So it's a both and kind of thing.

305
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,990
Both are great.

306
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,851
And they they just give different kinds of skills.

307
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:22,733
So if you're somebody who it works for you to calm and that centers and that's great.

308
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:26,175
And but if you're one of those people where you say why common center, but then

309
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:28,504
I'm still me doing me.

310
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:35,171
It's like, well, there's this other way that you can use it to actually release the stored tension in the body.

311
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:40,697
We don't realize we're storing it in our body, but we are it's held in our shoulders and our back and our jaw.

312
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,340
It's like this tensions just held there.

313
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,841
And so to be able to release it gives us that opportunity, you know.

314
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:54,643
And I want to say one other thing just about, you know, talking about people feeling like they have to do something.

315
00:23:54,663 --> 00:24:04,285
A lot of what I'm seeing is people feeling like we've got to stand up and we've got to, you know, some people are saying we have to fight certain things and some people are like,

316
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:15,271
I'm one of the things I want to say about that is I watch a lot of my friends and people on Facebook or Instagram or threads or any of those social media, you know, blue sky.

317
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:23,957
And, and I do see that we are called to do something, you know, to really help during this upheaval.

318
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:27,759
It doesn't matter what your politics are, there's going to be upheaval, right.

319
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,361
And so we're all called in community to help.

320
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,862
And so there's kind of two ways that I think about it.

321
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:40,663
One is there's this work of Joanna Macy who, she's an environmental advocate, really beautiful.

322
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:43,084
She's in her 90s now, she's amazing.

323
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:47,705
And one of the things she says to remind people is that you don't have to do it all.

324
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:54,446
She said when it comes to healing the world, she actually has found there's like three buckets, three ways to help.

325
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:57,387
The first is some people are called to

326
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,211
massage or stop the pain.

327
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:10,354
And she said, these are people who are doctors and nurses and, you know, those kinds of people, she said, lawyers, Sierra Club people, they go to court and stop, you know, something.

328
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:13,195
And she said, so some people are called to stop the pain.

329
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:16,136
But some people are called to change consciousness.

330
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:23,759
And she's like, those people are therapists, coaches, school teachers, they change your consciousness when they're with you, right.

331
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:28,141
And she said, and then there's these people that are the builders, they build the new way.

332
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:34,405
And these are people who are in tech, maybe they build solar panels, they find ways to get garbage out of the ocean.

333
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:38,488
And she said, you don't have to do everything, don't feel overwhelmed.

334
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:45,133
Yours is to figure out what you're called to what your heart says, I can't turn away from this is mine to do.

335
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:56,419
clear the blocks and the fears that are in the way so that you're empowered in your essential nature and then step in to do your piece to do.

336
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:09,547
Are there moments like you know the other ideas like well if you live in a village and you say well I'm just the baker well I'm just the smithy well I'm just you know it's nice we have that but when when the village is on fire

337
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:11,809
Everybody grab a bucket, right?

338
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:14,131
We all come together as community in those moments.

339
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:21,259
And it's like, tomorrow, you get to be the baker tonight, you're the bucket filler, right?

340
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,303
So I think of it this way is like, how do we come back to this refuge?

341
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:27,045
How are we going to resource ourselves?

342
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:29,427
And then what's ours to do?

343
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,109
What are we called to do?

344
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:34,112
And just to do what you're called to do here.

345
00:26:34,252 --> 00:26:36,695
And if there's a big fire, sure, go ahead and grab a bucket.

346
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:39,918
Like, let's just, you know, protect our community all together.

347
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:41,680
You know, does that make sense?

348
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,962
Yeah, it's very calming.

349
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:50,943
Well, that's what I'm hoping that this training is really calming, like the people that are in the Southwest are like, Oh, my God, we love it.

350
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:56,808
I had one person tell me that she said, Oh, I got online to see when your Boston training dates were.

351
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,969
And I was like, Why?

352
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,532
She said, I'm thinking of taking the Boston training.

353
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,173
I'm like, you're in the Southwest training.

354
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,775
She goes, I know, but I just want more.

355
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:06,457
I was like, Wow, that's, that's a good sit.

356
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:15,444
Yeah, so yeah, so that's that's kind of where things are at and

357
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:21,308
And I hope that this drops some gems in in terms of for your community and coming together.

358
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:26,091
I really want to leave us with this idea that we all have open hearts.

359
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:32,855
And when we feel safe and we feel OK, then our heart is way open to everybody.

360
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:38,418
And when our heart closes is when we've been tapped by some kind of fear, some kind of doubt.

361
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:43,742
And so for people to just start getting curious about that, if you're shut down from somebody,

362
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:49,585
maybe take a moment to step back inside and just mindfully ask, what am I concerned about here?

363
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:50,525
What?

364
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,646
What am I frustrated with?

365
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:52,646
What am I scared of?

366
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:53,007
What?

367
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:54,908
What's uncomfortable for me here?

368
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,069
Because it starts with us.

369
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:01,851
And once we can release that fear, that open heart just opens again.

370
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,672
And then it's all of us again.

371
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:04,793
Yeah.

372
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:14,660
And so I'll put in our show notes some of the information that you shared, how to get your book, when the training will be in, when the library event will be.

373
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,041
But thank you so much for sharing all this with us.

374
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,162
Yeah, thank you.

375
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:20,584
I'm so glad I got to hang with you and do this.

376
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:30,771
I want people to have more freedom and joy and community and feel comfortable and resourced as we go through big waves.

377
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:32,492
Yeah.

378
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,233
Well, thank you.

379
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:33,653
