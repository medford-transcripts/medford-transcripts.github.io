    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=88.245">part</a>  of the reason I know there's like great sandwiches and things like that but I always come home for mocha chip ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=96.659">I</a>  grew up on it in Brigham's and it's like oh yeah I always have to come and get some mocha chip so yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=103.609">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=104.21">And</a>  so we're here to talk about a few things, but we do know that you're coming to Medford to the library in January to talk about your book. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=114.599">I'm</a>  wondering if you could give us a little bit of background about you, kind of how you arrived at this place where you decided to write this book. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=120.625">And</a>  yeah, tell us a little bit more about what it's about.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=123.818">Yeah,</a>  so the book is called Reimagining Success, Manifesting Happiness and Fulfillment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=130.042">And</a>  my husband and I, he's a psychiatrist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=133.544">And</a>  we both trained here in Boston and then moved to Colorado where we raised our kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=140.087">And</a>  we were working both together in private practice work and with Department of Human Services and school organizations, lots of different interface with children and families and adults and doing that work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=153.815">And</a>  we, you know, there's, there's endless need, there's endless need when it comes to working with people in struggling situations, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=165.303">And</a>  there's an old story that a teacher told me, we live in the southwest of Colorado, and a teacher told me a story called the river story. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=172.508">I</a>  don't know if your listeners are familiar with it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=174.99">But</a>  it's a story about how two friends are walking up a path along a river. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=179.452">and</a>  they see some kids drowning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=181.353">And</a>  they jump in the river and start pulling the kids out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=183.674">And</a>  it's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=185.034">And</a>  then all of a sudden, they realize there's more kids coming, and there's more kids coming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=188.836">And</a>  they're pulling out, and they're getting exhausted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=190.677">And</a>  it's endless. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=192.517">It's</a>  absolutely endless. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=193.858">And</a>  all of a sudden, one of the friends gets out of the river and starts walking away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=197.719">And</a>  his friend screams at him and says, where are you going? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=200.36">There's</a>  all these kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=201.221">And</a>  he said, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=202.203">I'm</a>  going up river to find out how these kids are falling in the river. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=206.066">And</a>  so when you do a lot of direct service work, after a few years, you're like, how did this happen? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=212.13">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=212.33">You</a>  start going up river to try to figure out why is everybody falling in the river? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=217.854">And</a>  that's what my husband, Mark, and I ended up doing was starting looking at what are the patterns? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=222.937">Why</a>  are people falling in the river? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=224.418">What's</a>  going on? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=225.159">Is</a>  there any way to stop that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=227.18">help</a>  people either not fall in the river or can we teach them how to climb out so that they're not coming down where we're seeing them after years and years of you know falling in and chaos and so um so we started this work where we started kind of mapping <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=244.105">this</a>  idea that people had about living a successful life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=247.267">Because</a>  a lot of people would come in our office and say, no, I'm successful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=250.929">I</a>  have this job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=252.07">I</a>  have, you know, three cars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=253.57">I</a>  have whatever I might have, 2.4 children, you know, whatever it might be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=258.653">But</a>  unlucky 0.4. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=259.213">Exactly,</a>  right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=263.076">And</a>  it was like, but then some area of their life was a mess, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=267.399">They're</a>  like, I got a drinking problem, or I have anxiety, and I'm up every night, and I can't make it go away, even though supposedly, I'm a successful person, what's wrong here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=276.124">And</a>  so we started breaking down, where's this breaking down? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=280.087">What's</a>  happening here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=281.328">And</a>  what we came up with is that human beings have seven domains of functioning, we call them the building blocks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=288.092">And</a>  so it's your psychological functioning, your emotional, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=291.381">your</a>  cognitive functioning, your spiritual functioning even, your social relational intimacy issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=298.965">And</a>  so of these seven areas, supposedly successful people are coming in having difficulty. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=306.389">And</a>  what we could see was, wow, they were really successful at like two areas maybe, like really gifted maybe even, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=313.733">Like</a>  I'm great at math or I'm great at this, I'm a great <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=316.913">you</a>  know, I'm great at programming or whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=318.974">They</a>  had something they were great at, a couple of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=321.556">And</a>  they were okay at three of them, let's say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=324.618">But</a>  then there were like two at the bottom that they were really drowning and struggling in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=330.322">And</a>  what we found was that when we looked at their whole story, that actually the two bottom things were dragging their entire life down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=339.808">So</a>  people had this concept that if I'm successful in one or two areas, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=344.338">well</a>  then life will be great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=346.199">And</a>  what we were seeing is no, because you're successful at one or two areas, and yet you're being really pulled down by this other issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=353.725">Like</a>  it might be alcoholism, it might be anxiety, it might be drug abuse, it might be I'm addicted to something, gambling, something like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=362.832">Or</a>  I can't do intimacy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=363.913">I'm</a>  great at work, I come home at night, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=366.715">I</a>  can't do intimacy with my family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=369.679">So</a>  what became clear to us was that these two lower domains were really pulling everything down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=376.326">And</a>  if we could help people get those two domains up to just a level of competence, just not dragging us in the mud, then people could start realizing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=386.817">a</a>  more successful life or a more fulfilling life and what we came to define a successful life as was not like what you bought and what you owned and not those kinds of things but are you living your true nature you know your authentic nature who you really are and are you living a meaningful and fulfilling life for you whatever that means so that became our definition of success <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=411.038">And</a>  by bringing up these lower two domains, we started realizing that people had a chance to actually realize a meaningful and fulfilling life for themselves because they weren't being undone by that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=423.546">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=424.227">It</a>  makes sense to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=425.888">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=426.708">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=427.028">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=427.949">And</a>  so how like, so yeah, how do you do this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=430.471">Or</a>  like, how can people kind of learn more about how this works?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=434.273">Yeah,</a>  so then it became, okay, let's look at why those are breaking down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=439.965">And</a>  so when we started looking at those domains that were struggling, what we found was that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=447.309">pretty</a>  much consistently, people had some kind of trauma or pain or wound in those domains, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=455.591">And</a>  so, and some of it was big trauma, and some of it was like little life trauma kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=463.634">So</a>  I'll give an example, like we might meet somebody who said, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=468.935">they're</a>  not functioning very well in the cognitive domain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=471.556">They</a>  have a hard time reading, they're dyslexic, or it could be anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=475.396">Or</a>  they just shut down from school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=477.137">They're</a>  like, I hated school, and I just don't do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=480.017">And</a>  yet, that cognitive functioning is getting in their way at work now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=483.758">And</a>  they perceive of themselves as somebody who is stupid, or they can't learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=488.919">And</a>  when we go back and say, well, where'd you get that story from? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=492.213">You</a>  know, we would find, oh, you could deepen somebody down and find that they had a whole story in there about something like, I'll just make it up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=500.996">You</a>  know, in fifth grade, I was reading my book report in front of Miss McGuire's class, and she yelled at me, and the kids laughed at me, and I just said, I'm never doing this again, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=511.259">Or</a>  the kid who strikes out at baseball and says, baseball is stupid. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=515.32">I'm</a>  never doing this again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=516.921">And</a>  so everybody had these stories of pain and shutdown in them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=521.442">So</a>  what we started doing was using, I started bringing together the mindfulness training I have and the psychology training I have to help people mindfully work their way down to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=532.935">Like</a>  what is that wound? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=534.317">What</a>  is that yeah but? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=535.818">What</a>  is that no that's there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=538.341">And</a>  then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=539.533">showing</a>  them how they could actually release that old trauma that old wound and clear their system and come back to kind of like their what we call your essential nature it's kind of like who you were as a kid before you got shut down right it's like when we were little we'd go outside and play outside of trauma I know some people really had trauma as children but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=563.173">Most</a>  people have some memories of going outside as a kid, getting away from the grown-ups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=568.396">And</a>  then there's this freedom, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=570.537">This</a>  freedom to just explore and be me, and young kids have that, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=575.68">And</a>  so that's what we're helping people do, is come back to their essential nature, who you are underneath. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=581.772">all</a>  the abuts and the nos and the fear and all that stuff, so that you actually can get back on track to realize your potential, to live out your dreams and goals, you know, the things that make your life meaningful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=598.255">And</a>  so we came up with a protocol for how people could do this using some mindfulness, releasing this tension out of their body, coming back to their essential nature, and then building skill, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=609.958">So</a>  it's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=610.658">It's</a>  like if you, let's say you'd love to learn how to swim, but you're scared of water. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=615.162">You</a>  know, chances are we go back and go, oh, there's a memory back there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=619.126">I</a>  almost drowned when I was five years old. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=620.987">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=621.728">And</a>  we go ahead and release that skill and get you back in touch with your essential nature. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=626.552">And</a>  somebody goes, oh, my God, I really love the water. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=629.114">I</a>  really do want to swim. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=630.436">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=630.696">Which</a>  is lovely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=632.217">But</a>  you still have to go take swim lessons probably. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=634.519">It's</a>  not like you just release your fear and suddenly you know how to do something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=638.182">You</a>  still have to cultivate it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=639.883">So</a>  we say that our true nature is rediscovered and cultivated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=644.928">Rediscovered</a>  and cultivated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=646.429">Who</a>  are you really? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=647.33">Who's</a>  your true nature? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=649.631">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=650.693">how</a>  do you cultivate that so that you can actually get back on track where you want to be? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=654.935">Which</a>  is really fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=655.995">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=656.215">Well,</a>  and it sounds like the way that you're talking about it now, it has very personal benefit, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=661.737">So</a>  I'm realizing my potential, what I want to be, what I want to do, being able to remove some of maybe those internal blockages to be able to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=671.441">I</a>  can imagine, but maybe you can explain better how <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=675.242">this</a>  would benefit like a community or how like if we were to work on this just generally how it could also have like that maybe ripple effect into it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=683.467">Oh</a>  yeah, beautiful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=685.087">So</a>  I love that part because I do want to help develop communities with this, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=689.61">So</a>  part of what happens in community is that when people come together for a shared experience, they don't realize they're bringing all this conditioning of their own, of their old pain, their old fears, their old what ifs, yeah buts, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=704.578">And</a>  so everybody comes back together or comes together with a great intention. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=709.042">And</a>  then we start grinding with each other around, well, that doesn't feel comfortable to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=713.725">Well,</a>  that doesn't feel comfortable to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=715.347">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=715.667">So</a>  in this work, it allows us to actually release the personal edge we have and come back to that deeper nature, our deeper values where we do care about community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=728.817">Often</a>  what I find as a therapist is that we have big, beautiful, open hearts until we're afraid. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=736.08">And</a>  as soon as we're afraid, doors start shutting and it's like me, mine, your other, I'm not in this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=743.982">So</a>  I'll give you an example. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=745.723">I</a>  was working with a group and they had done a DEI training, diversity, equity and inclusion training, and they really wanted to diversify their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=755.846">I'll</a>  say a board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=756.606">They</a>  wanted to diversify the board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=758.507">But</a>  a year later, they actually weren't any more diversified. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=762.348">And</a>  so- Classic story.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=764.008">Yeah,</a>  right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=764.768">And</a>  they were like, what's up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=765.788">We</a>  paid for this expensive training. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=767.629">Everybody</a>  took it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=768.369">How</a>  come we're not there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=770.089">And</a>  so I came in and just worked with this group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=772.49">And</a>  I said, so let me just ask a simple question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=775.151">Everybody</a>  close your eyes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=776.131">Let's</a>  get mindful for just a second. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=778.291">And</a>  just notice what happens if I say, so imagine half this board is now people of color, LGBTQIA people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=785.953">Notice</a>  what happens and I could see people like like contract right and it's like so let's work with that let's work with that contraction that happens and everybody did it on their own we didn't share it wasn't it was all private work everybody did private work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=801.955">But</a>  at the end, I said, well, does anybody want to share their experience? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=805.817">They</a>  don't have to, but does anybody want to? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=808.257">And</a>  actually, the leader of the group said, yeah, actually, I want to share mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=812.299">And</a>  which I thought was great leadership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=815.84">And</a>  he said, what was interesting was, I couldn't believe it when you helped me deepen down, I found an old fear I had from when I was 12 years old. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=824.103">And</a>  it was an exchange that I had. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=826.404">with</a>  a black gentleman and he said, nothing bad happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=829.345">He</a>  said he bumped into me at a movie theater in line and he said, but I got really scared. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=833.927">He</a>  was really tall and I got really, really scared. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=836.708">And</a>  he said, and all of a sudden I realized I had formed a belief that I had formed a belief that black, this black man is scary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=844.77">And</a>  he said, and I had no idea that was in there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=847.671">And</a>  he said, until you asked us to, like, reflect on that contraction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=852.613">And</a>  when he released it, he got back in touch with his own essential nature, he got back in touch with his heart. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=858.995">And</a>  he said, in that moment, thinking about the board being diversified was exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=864.297">Like,</a>  I was joyful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=865.457">I</a>  was like, Oh, my God, yeah, but let's do it now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=867.918">Like,</a>  how do we make it happen now? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=869.698">And</a>  so it's things like that, that we don't realize that we have these, I call them formation, sometimes their inner child, like you got a inner four year old <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=877.421">is</a>  freaking out or an inner 15-year-old is pissed off, you know, we all have these parts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=882.763">And</a>  we don't realize how much they actually drive our behavior. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=887.425">And</a>  so this work is around how do we get in touch with the limits of that, the things that are limiting us, the fears or whatever that might be, the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=895.688">The</a>  doubts, things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=897.41">How</a>  do we get in touch with that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=899.092">And</a>  then release that so I can come back to my ground, come back to my centered groundness and go, this is who I am without my fear. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=907.221">And</a>  I think when communities do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=909.865">then</a>  that's when they remember, oh yeah, my heart is open to everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=915.186">If</a>  it's not, chances are there's a doubt or a fear or something coming up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=919.267">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=920.227">It</a>  does, and I think for folks that are listening and are like, why are we talking about this on a Medford podcast? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=926.429">I</a>  do think it's very relevant to the way that our community is sort of in crisis right now, where I think fear is the base of a lot of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=935.65">It's</a>  like, how are we relating to our neighbors? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=938.191">like</a>  making decisions as a community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=939.993">How</a>  are we deciding what our shared values are? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=942.195">And</a>  I do think that fear comes up a lot for folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=945.158">And</a>  I see it, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=946.399">I</a>  see like when people have conversations about different changes that they're seeing in the city or changes that they want, or like who's making the decisions, who isn't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=952.966">I</a>  think that fear comes up a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=955.488">And</a>  fear generally like throughout our country right now about like, what's happening? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=961.314">What's</a>  going to happen next? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=962.475">What</a>  are we going to lose? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=963.355">What</a>  are we going to gain? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=964.516">Like,</a>  yeah, so I think it feels very relevant.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=968.457">Yeah,</a>  I think so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=969.478">And</a>  I think so knowing, you know, one taking accountability for that, if I'm shut down to somebody, I probably have some doubt or fear about this person or about my experience with this person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=979.682">And</a>  owning that is mine, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=981.963">And</a>  then the other piece that comes up is in terms of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=988.79">That</a>  fear often then keeps us in a bubble, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=992.532">And</a>  so if I'm afraid of those kind of people, then I don't associate with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=998.615">I</a>  stay in my bubble of friends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=999.995">I</a>  stay in my bubble of what's known to me, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1002.697">And</a>  the problem with that is that when we're in that kind of bubble, we start what's called othering, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1010.621">There's</a>  us and them, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1012.922">Instead</a>  of expanding that bubble to be more inclusive to, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1017.904">All</a>  of us belong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1019.645">All</a>  of us belong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1021.245">And</a>  so to me, how do we personally get through that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1026.267">It's</a>  by releasing whatever fear we're bringing to that moment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1029.988">That's</a>  what's going to empower us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1031.788">It</a>  also empowers us to have our voice, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1034.769">A</a>  lot of people have beautiful ideas about the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1037.85">And</a>  they want to stand up and speak about them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1040.332">And</a>  they're terrified to because I'm afraid of rejection. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1043.273">I'm</a>  afraid of shame, I'm afraid of whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1046.055">And</a>  I think about like, you know, the way it is, the world is right now, it's it's in a lot of upheaval right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1054.22">And,</a>  and people have good ideas about how we could attend to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1059.536">But</a>  you have to have that groundedness in yourself, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1063.219">And</a>  a lot of times I'll hear people say things like, oh, speak even if your voice shakes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1067.843">And</a>  yeah, I think that's a good thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1070.185">But</a>  I would much rather help somebody figure out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1074.718">how</a>  to release that fear so that your voice isn't even shaking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1078.94">So</a>  that you're actually just really centered and clear. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1081.741">And</a>  you're like, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1084.683">I'm</a>  not trying to be difficult here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1086.364">I'm</a>  just trying to include everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1089.925">Something</a>  like that, right?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1091.706">Yeah,</a>  sounds lovely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1093.827">And</a>  so people can learn more about your book at the library, and then you want to talk about your training?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1099.252">Yeah,</a>  so the book is called Reimagining Success, and it's available on things like bookshop.org if you like supporting independent bookstores. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1111.882">And</a>  then yes, you can get it in other places, like those big places.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1116.165">The</a>  evil empire.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1117.566">Yes,</a>  and there's also, there's also an audio version of the book. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1122.349">So</a>  if you're somebody who doesn't, I did that for I had a lot of clients who said they had dyslexia and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1128.592">And</a>  so I did an audio version for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1131.074">And</a>  so you can listen to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1132.714">And</a>  it has the mindfulness piece, which is nice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1135.316">So</a>  it has some exercises that you can listen to that are that are helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1140.619">And</a>  so there's that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1142.14">And</a>  then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1143.203">Part</a>  of what I'm doing is I came home to promote a training that I'm going to start January 2025, so it's coming up this January, and it's actually a training for therapists that might be interested in learning how to do this work, how to show people how to release their own stress, their own <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1161.786">pain</a>  and fear, even trauma, it even works for trauma, and then help them get grounded in this essential nature so that they have their strength, they have their seed going forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1173.2">But</a>  it's also available to people that I consider in healing and leadership roles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1178.106">So</a>  right now we have a training going on in the southwest and I would say half that training is filled with therapists and the other half are people who are in healing or leadership roles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1187.208">So</a>  for instance we have somebody who is part of an NGO who does global development work and for her it really helps her get her center and her voice when she's out there in the world working with a lot of chaos on the global scale. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1201.711">So</a>  it's good for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1203.151">It</a>  helps with burnout if you're in one of those jobs where you're doing a lot of caretaking and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1207.812">you're</a>  just like, oh my goodness, it's, you know, as the river story says, it never ends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1213.636">It</a>  never ends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1214.337">And</a>  we don't have any resources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1215.858">Like,</a>  how does one meet this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1218.14">And,</a>  and when people get in touch with this essential nature, what I tell them is, it's like you become oceanic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1224.745">And</a>  yes, that might be a 90 foot rogue wave out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1227.827">But</a>  the ocean's bigger than the wave, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1230.108">The</a>  ocean's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1231.029">aren't</a>  bothered by waves, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1233.03">So</a>  it's a way of like really finding this deep centering in yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1236.611">So</a>  that training will start in January and it's an in-person training, which is really sweet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1242.853">Six</a>  months, it's a six weekend, six weekends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1246.475">And</a>  the point of it is to have it be experiential where people get to do their own release, where people learn how to facilitate with other people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1255.378">If</a>  you're a therapist, for instance, and you're doing therapy work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1259.461">But</a>  also to create a cohort of people in the community in this area saying, we all know each other, we lean on each other, we've got each other, we all know this work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1270.349">And</a>  we've got this center of refuge within ourselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1274.051">And</a>  when I think about coming into 2025, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1276.893">It</a>  sounds like a great idea to like create a group of people that are like, we know how to deal with stress.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1282.937">Well</a>  and like I mean I think that mindfulness like we didn't really go deeply into like describing what it is and I think some people have some understanding of it and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1292.888">I</a>  think sometimes people lump it in with like meditation and like yeah there's definitely like an overlap there but I do think finding something in a time that feels like so chaotic and out of our control to like be centered to have at least some control over your own kind of well-being and mental health is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1310.898">is</a>  really helpful and like i will say that you and i did practice you practice this with me a little bit and and i was like very surprised as somebody who can be skeptical about these things it was like really powerful um so i mean definitely recommend it professionally and also personally um but yeah i think like a lot of people especially in january 2025 are going to be looking for a way <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1332.477">to</a>  have some have some sense of control or some thing that they can do to feel empowered or centered or grounded. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1340.12">And</a>  this is, I feel like a great option.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1342.862">Yeah,</a>  and what's beautiful about this is, you know, a lot of times people will use mindfulness to focus their mind on something like their breath or something like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1351.265">And</a>  by doing that, you do calm your system, which is beautiful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1355.028">But</a>  oftentimes, as a meditation teacher, I'll hear people say, but what's wrong with me, I got up off the cushion, or, you know, and then I yelled at my dog five minutes later, I'm a bad meditator. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1365.957">And</a>  what I tell people is, there's two different ways to use mindfulness. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1370.301">One</a>  is where we're calming the system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1372.062">And</a>  that's beautiful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1372.963">And</a>  that helps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1373.603">And</a>  that is so so helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1375.645">But</a>  the other piece is where we're releasing tension out of the body. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1379.504">And</a>  that's where we're using our mindfulness to release the anxiety, to release the heat, to release the pain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1385.106">And</a>  that's where you get the emptying that then allows you to feel more stable for longer periods of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1391.329">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1392.029">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1392.689">So</a>  it's a both and kind of thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1394.33">Both</a>  are great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1395.19">And</a>  they they just give different kinds of skills. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1397.912">So</a>  if you're somebody who it works for you to calm and that centers and that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1403.114">And</a>  but if you're one of those people where you say why common center, but then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1407.162">I'm</a>  still me doing me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1408.764">It's</a>  like, well, there's this other way that you can use it to actually release the stored tension in the body. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1415.231">We</a>  don't realize we're storing it in our body, but we are it's held in our shoulders and our back and our jaw. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1421.378">It's</a>  like this tensions just held there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1423.78">And</a>  so to be able to release it gives us that opportunity, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1428.061">And</a>  I want to say one other thing just about, you know, talking about people feeling like they have to do something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1434.663">A</a>  lot of what I'm seeing is people feeling like we've got to stand up and we've got to, you know, some people are saying we have to fight certain things and some people are like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1445.305">I'm</a>  one of the things I want to say about that is I watch a lot of my friends and people on Facebook or Instagram or threads or any of those social media, you know, blue sky. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1456.112">And,</a>  and I do see that we are called to do something, you know, to really help during this upheaval. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1463.977">It</a>  doesn't matter what your politics are, there's going to be upheaval, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1468.159">And</a>  so we're all called in community to help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1471.201">And</a>  so there's kind of two ways that I think about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1474.022">One</a>  is there's this work of Joanna Macy who, she's an environmental advocate, really beautiful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1481.243">She's</a>  in her 90s now, she's amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1483.764">And</a>  one of the things she says to remind people is that you don't have to do it all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1488.485">She</a>  said when it comes to healing the world, she actually has found there's like three buckets, three ways to help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1495.526">The</a>  first is some people are called to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1498.79">massage</a>  or stop the pain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1500.991">And</a>  she said, these are people who are doctors and nurses and, you know, those kinds of people, she said, lawyers, Sierra Club people, they go to court and stop, you know, something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1510.814">And</a>  she said, so some people are called to stop the pain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1513.676">But</a>  some people are called to change consciousness. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1516.637">And</a>  she's like, those people are therapists, coaches, school teachers, they change your consciousness when they're with you, right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1524.239">And</a>  she said, and then there's these people that are the builders, they build the new way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1528.741">And</a>  these are people who are in tech, maybe they build solar panels, they find ways to get garbage out of the ocean. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1534.425">And</a>  she said, you don't have to do everything, don't feel overwhelmed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1539.128">Yours</a>  is to figure out what you're called to what your heart says, I can't turn away from this is mine to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1547.174">clear</a>  the blocks and the fears that are in the way so that you're empowered in your essential nature and then step in to do your piece to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1556.86">Are</a>  there moments like you know the other ideas like well if you live in a village and you say well I'm just the baker well I'm just the smithy well I'm just you know it's nice we have that but when when the village is on fire <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1570.227">Everybody</a>  grab a bucket, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1571.829">We</a>  all come together as community in those moments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1574.231">And</a>  it's like, tomorrow, you get to be the baker tonight, you're the bucket filler, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1581.659">So</a>  I think of it this way is like, how do we come back to this refuge? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1585.363">How</a>  are we going to resource ourselves? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1587.705">And</a>  then what's ours to do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1589.988">What</a>  are we called to do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1591.429">And</a>  just to do what you're called to do here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1594.252">And</a>  if there's a big fire, sure, go ahead and grab a bucket. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1597.015">Like,</a>  let's just, you know, protect our community all together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1600.579">You</a>  know, does that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1601.74">Yeah,</a>  it's very calming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1604.597">Well,</a>  that's what I'm hoping that this training is really calming, like the people that are in the Southwest are like, Oh, my God, we love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1611.323">I</a>  had one person tell me that she said, Oh, I got online to see when your Boston training dates were.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1616.848">And</a>  I was like, Why? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1618.29">She</a>  said, I'm thinking of taking the Boston training. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1620.572">I'm</a>  like, you're in the Southwest training. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1622.193">She</a>  goes, I know, but I just want more.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1623.795">I</a>  was like, Wow, that's, that's a good sit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1628.91">Yeah,</a>  so yeah, so that's that's kind of where things are at and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1636.285">And</a>  I hope that this drops some gems in in terms of for your community and coming together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1641.788">I</a>  really want to leave us with this idea that we all have open hearts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1646.611">And</a>  when we feel safe and we feel OK, then our heart is way open to everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1653.495">And</a>  when our heart closes is when we've been tapped by some kind of fear, some kind of doubt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1658.899">And</a>  so for people to just start getting curious about that, if you're shut down from somebody, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1664.482">maybe</a>  take a moment to step back inside and just mindfully ask, what am I concerned about here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1670.285">What?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1670.705">What</a>  am I frustrated with? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1671.706">What</a>  am I scared of? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1672.766">What?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1673.447">What's</a>  uncomfortable for me here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1675.548">Because</a>  it starts with us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1677.749">And</a>  once we can release that fear, that open heart just opens again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1682.472">And</a>  then it's all of us again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1684.593">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1686.554">And</a>  so I'll put in our show notes some of the information that you shared, how to get your book, when the training will be in, when the library event will be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1694.68">But</a>  thank you so much for sharing all this with us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1697.061">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1698.202">I'm</a>  so glad I got to hang with you and do this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1700.664">I</a>  want people to have more freedom and joy and community and feel comfortable and resourced as we go through big waves.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1711.972">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1712.712">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XCdVf9nXEX0WbJn9lTbXW?t=1713.393">Thanks.</a> </p>
