10
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:35,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi John, thanks so much for joining me tonight.

11
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:37,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

12
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start off, I've been asking everybody about their favorite spots to eat in Medford and what they like to order at those spots.

13
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an ice cream fanatic.

14
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:48,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I love ice cream.

15
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:57,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB Scoops, Colleen's, those are two places I usually go to and I like

16
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,444
[SPEAKER_00]: shakes, sundaes, you name it.

17
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:04,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love ice cream.

18
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:09,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love eating ice cream, so it doesn't matter what time of the season.

19
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be in the middle of the winter, but I love ice cream, so I really enjoy it.

20
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:17,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard Massachusetts is a popular place for winter ice cream, too, which is kind of funny.

21
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that is correct.

22
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:28,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to say I heard some sort of statistic a while back that we eat, I think, the most ice cream during the winter than, like, any other state or something like that.

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:28,506
[SPEAKER_00]: That fits.

24
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:30,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

25
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you've had a busy couple of weeks.

26
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of down to the wire with the campaign before the election.

27
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:37,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Early voting's already started.

28
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:44,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just kind of curious to hear, I'm asking kind of folks just about their path to local politics.

29
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:50,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've been involved since school committee many years ago and to the city council and now running for mayor.

30
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what's kind of driving you to do that?

31
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,443
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, you know, what's bringing you to the table here?

32
00:02:55,384 --> 00:03:01,746
[SPEAKER_00]: So my path to politics started when my wife and I began our family.

33
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:05,908
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say that my path to politics started at the purple door.

34
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:08,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple door is the Medford Family Network.

35
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where my wife and I

36
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first child, and we went there, and they have a lot of great programming and activities.

37
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:22,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And we met so many people through the network.

38
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:36,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got involved with being a parent leader within the Method Family Network, and I served at the state level representing the Method Family Network, and also headed up the legislative action committee.

39
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:40,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoyed all the programs that they had to offer.

40
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackie, myself, and at the time my son John, we would go to all the activities.

41
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:54,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before you know it, we had another son, Joey, and another son, Jack, and then we just, we spent a lot of time at the Medford Filming Network.

42
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:58,270
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have friends that I met there 20 years ago that are still friends today.

43
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think, one of the great things about the Medford Filming Network.

44
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:05,094
[SPEAKER_00]: But it got me involved in what was going on in our community.

45
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as the kids got older, they started going to school.

46
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:15,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed, you know, as they started becoming more involved in school issues, that when I looked at the school committee at the time,

47
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:21,262
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only one person on the school committee that had kids in the school system.

48
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:26,646
[SPEAKER_00]: To me that was a disconnect and that's really what spurred me to run for local office.

49
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:35,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran for school committee and I served on the school committee for six years and we made a lot of great changes both inside and outside of the classroom.

50
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:39,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, so I served there from 2010 to 2015.

51
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:48,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ran for city council in 2000, actually serving on city council from 2016 to present day.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm running for mayor.

53
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:50,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:53,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was the switch for you from school committee to city council?

55
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:54,443
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that about?

56
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:55,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.

57
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:58,524
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was there was more that I wanted to do.

58
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:14,651
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I got more involved, and we had a lot of different projects in the school system that we were starting to kind of launch with regard to new technology spending and new science labs, we became more involved.

59
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:19,414
[SPEAKER_00]: with kind of the city council, because we had to go before them to get approval on those projects.

60
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:34,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, being someone that lived in Medford and had kids in the school system and just got involved in a lot of different things throughout the community, I got really involved in a lot of just city-wide issues outside of the schools, and that really interested me a lot.

61
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:40,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to get more involved in that area, and so at that point I decided, you know what, I want to run for city council.

62
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,872
[SPEAKER_00]: City Council that went really well and I've been enjoying that.

63
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:50,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Led a lot of efforts with regard to zoning, traffic engineer.

64
00:05:50,834 --> 00:06:00,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a lot of work in those areas and bring community public safety meetings out to the public and into the neighborhoods.

65
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:04,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of good things that I've done in those six years.

66
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at this point here, I've decided to run for mayor and moving forward.

67
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, it's only less than a week away.

68
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:13,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty exciting.

69
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,654
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working hard and we're out and about and looking to be elected to mayor.

70
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, those shifts from like parent to school committee member to city councilor, there was sort of like a shift in maybe priorities for what you want, the impact you wanted to have, the changes you wanted to make.

71
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:37,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you think about running for mayor, what are your sort of priorities for change there?

72
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:38,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.

73
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,527
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of priorities.

74
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a look at education to me is always a priority.

75
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,170
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I started.

76
00:06:46,610 --> 00:07:01,898
[SPEAKER_00]: as a proud father of three kids that are currently attending or attended the Medford Public Schools, as a proud graduate of Medford High School myself, I graduated in 1988, and as a former member of the school committee.

77
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly realize the importance of a strong public school system.

78
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe that our city is only as strong as its school system.

79
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we're constantly working to improve our school system.

80
00:07:13,984 --> 00:07:27,788
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a look at my time on the school committee, and I mentioned previously about changes that we made both inside and outside of the classroom, we put in brand new science labs, technology district-wide.

81
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:32,249
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually refurbished the swimming pool.

82
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in new athletic fields.

83
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,112
[SPEAKER_00]: We upgraded our vocational school to offer STEM subjects like engineering, biotechnology.

84
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:46,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually improved some of the machinery within those programs as well.

85
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:54,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big things that we also did was we started before and after school programming, before and after school care.

86
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important for our working families.

87
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:00,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to come back as mayor and bring those all full circle.

88
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:08,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at the before and after school programming, the lottery for that closed on March 1st.

89
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,114
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's unacceptable.

90
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:16,818
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure we're providing before and after school programming to all our working families, all our families that want it.

91
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:18,679
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there's a real need out there.

92
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,160
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to provide that.

93
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a main priority.

94
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:31,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at our vocational school and make sure that we have, you know, the latest and greatest with regard to technology, not just in the vocational school, but throughout the district.

95
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:38,973
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we are providing our students all of the equipment and technology they need to succeed.

96
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:42,135
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically giving them the tools that they need to succeed.

97
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,016
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a major priority.

98
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:46,838
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to, you know,

99
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:59,548
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at the programs that we're offering to make sure that they're current with the jobs that currently are in the, the jobs that are available once they graduate from high school.

100
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:00,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to take a look at that.

101
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to the vocational school.

102
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:10,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just need to, I want to make sure I come back and I want to be the mayor that brings all these things full circle.

103
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:14,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the main education priorities.

104
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:27,991
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a look at infrastructure, as I've gone from neighborhood to neighborhood, street to street, door to door, and I talk to residents, no matter what neighborhood you're in, one of the big topics that comes up is infrastructure.

105
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,633
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major priority.

106
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Our streets are in bad shape.

107
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our sidewalks are crumbling.

108
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things need to be addressed.

109
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And there needs to be a plan.

110
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, I feel that there really is no plan.

111
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,764
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a major issue.

112
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:50,445
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a look at the energy and the environment, we can always do work there.

113
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change is the biggest issue of our lifetime.

114
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,526
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a global issue, but there's a lot we can do at the local level.

115
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:03,248
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we have more electric charging stations throughout the city.

116
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:09,990
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we have, I think, over 200 vehicles, city-owned vehicles, in the city of Medford with regard to

117
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,112
[SPEAKER_00]: police, fire vehicles, DPW vehicles, the school vehicles as well.

118
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,494
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to gradually transition those over to electric vehicles.

119
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:23,036
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to make sure we're expanding our tree canopy.

120
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,457
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge priority.

121
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,818
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be growing more trees.

122
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we are taking a look at

123
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,814
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a river that runs right through the middle of our downtown.

124
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:37,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful river.

125
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,516
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be embracing that river.

126
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:52,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to make sure that, you know, we talk about climate change and rising tides, and we need to make sure that our sewer system, our sewer infrastructure is prepared to handle rising tides.

127
00:10:53,085 --> 00:11:00,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I get calls from residents all over the city, especially recently, you know, we're getting these, you know, microbursts of rainstorms that happen.

128
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,331
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's increased flooding throughout the city no matter where you live.

129
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:12,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a call a couple weeks ago from someone up in North Medford, down in West Medford, down by Placedead Road, you know, and down by the river as well.

130
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:21,255
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there are increased, you know, there are occurrences of, you know, flooding that happen on a regular basis now.

131
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:26,861
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that there are many residents that live down by the river that are concerned about this.

132
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that our sewer infrastructure can handle water, especially in short periods of time.

133
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a major concern.

134
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:37,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to take a look at that.

135
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:42,238
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to take a look at the Amelia Earhart Dam.

136
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,420
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a concern.

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,348
[SPEAKER_00]: As tides rise, we need to make sure that that dam is suitable for the future, sustainable for the future.

138
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:53,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to work with the state to make sure that that is going to be

139
00:11:55,736 --> 00:12:01,379
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that it's structurally sound and sustainable for the future as far as with rising tides.

140
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that we need to work with the state with on an issue like that.

141
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:13,926
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also diversity and inclusion, and that's something that to me is a huge priority.

142
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:22,611
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor, I think, for pretty much the past year and a half was trying to merge human resources with diversity and inclusion.

143
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:24,392
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's going backwards.

144
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:31,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a look at our city, 59,000 residents, 4,000 kids in a public school system, over 1,000 municipal employees.

145
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:36,540
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve a standalone diversity, inclusion, and equity office.

146
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person should be working hand-in-hand with

147
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:47,607
[SPEAKER_00]: the school staff to make sure that they're working hand-in-hand on a daily basis.

148
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:51,190
[SPEAKER_00]: City side, school side, we're developing programs.

149
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,513
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really tackling issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

150
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Method is more diverse than it's ever been.

151
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:00,397
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to embrace that.

152
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,459
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have programming around that.

153
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do more, and we should be doing more.

154
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:16,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard cities like Cambridge and their systems have liaisons to families that might speak a different language or something like that set up within the school system to sort of help outreach to those families.

155
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:17,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that Medford has?

156
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:24,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have translation services, but I don't think we have anybody that's doing that outreach.

157
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:30,633
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something that we need to, you know, so these are things that I think we need to work on more as a community.

158
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:33,096
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about diversity, inclusion, equity.

159
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,158
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have meetings on a regular basis.

160
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,419
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be monthly meetings.

161
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot that we need to do, a lot of work that we need to do here.

162
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,356
[SPEAKER_00]: as diverse as it's ever been.

163
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,517
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to embrace that.

164
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we're offering programming that supports that.

165
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure we're offering funding.

166
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,830
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure that we have a line item and a budget for diversity inclusion.

167
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,712
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make a commitment to this.

168
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important.

169
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was sort of my next question was around equity.

170
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:08,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds, I know I've been attending a lot of these, or I was attending a lot of the Zoom city council meetings and hearing that brought up a lot.

171
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:14,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess my thoughts are, in addition to what you've mentioned so far, what you think would help Medford be more equitable?

172
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

173
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:24,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as far as being more equitable, I think this position here, I think that having

174
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:39,835
[SPEAKER_00]: This position, I think, would work with the school, in my eyes, would work with the school system and make sure that the, you know, we are doing more to make sure that the employees that work for the city of Manhattan reflect the diversity of our community.

175
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:41,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have a long way to go there.

176
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So that position would help with that.

177
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:53,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think, you know, as far as equity goes, we need to look at, you know, affordable housing, making sure that we have, you know, more affordable housing.

178
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:54,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at, you know,

179
00:14:56,237 --> 00:15:02,179
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I, sometimes we'll sit down and we'll talk about, where are our kids going to live someday?

180
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:07,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we want them to live close by, we'd love for them to live in Medford, and hopefully they want to live in Medford.

181
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,183
[SPEAKER_00]: But homes now are selling for $800,000, $900,000, a million dollars.

182
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:18,066
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.

183
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:25,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So after school, when you're working or going to college, to buy a home in Medford, it's really hard.

184
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:30,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure that we're offering more affordable housing opportunities in our city.

185
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:39,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've been on the city council, I led an effort to establish an inclusionary housing ordinance.

186
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:48,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ordinance basically guarantees affordable housing units for different developments, depending on how many units they're building.

187
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:53,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one improvement that we've had with regard to inclusionary housing.

188
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:58,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also do work to an affordable housing trust as well.

189
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I've offered a resolution with regard

190
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:06,036
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing an affordable housing trust, and it's currently in the committee.

191
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:15,337
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on it, but that, to me, that'll be a priority if elected mayor, is to actually establish an affordable housing trust in the community.

192
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:21,499
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many affordable housing issues, and there are a lot of people that want to live here.

193
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:29,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Bedford's a very desirable place to live, and we need to make sure that there are affordable housing opportunities for everyone.

194
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and when I've been doing research for this podcast and all the different people in Medford and all the different skill sets and what people bring to the city, I imagine there is a real range of salaries there.

195
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:50,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to afford to move here or even rent here right now is prohibitive, I think.

196
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.

197
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:59,024
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to live here, but like you said, even renting a home now is renting an apartment.

198
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:01,324
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a lot of money.

199
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.

200
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're in a very desirable location.

201
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,766
[SPEAKER_00]: We're five miles north of Austin.

202
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:09,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, a lot of people like being close to the city.

203
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:17,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, bottom line, it's really expensive to live in the city of Medford.

204
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

205
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is a good lead-in, again, to my next question.

206
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,992
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say you appreciate most about the community of Medford?

207
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:34,116
[SPEAKER_00]: What I appreciate most about the City of Medford is there's so many different organizations throughout our city.

208
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:38,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people, there's so much that you can do.

209
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:41,178
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't be bored, especially if you want to get involved.

210
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:46,039
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different organizations that do a lot of great things.

211
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go back to one of my favorites, and that's the Medford Family Network.

212
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,444
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place to really get involved, and they have great programming for kids and parents.

213
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:14,391
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a great way to just give back your time, and to learn, and to take on parent leadership roles, and really helping to guide the network forward.

214
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:18,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also fundraising opportunities and stuff like that if you want to do that.

215
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:19,854
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me,

216
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:23,396
[SPEAKER_00]: the network's always been there.

217
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:34,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I like most about not only just the Medford Family Network, but a lot of our organizations throughout our community is the way people help out, the way people give back.

218
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,783
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great people in our community that are always giving back.

219
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:42,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always take a look at the Medford Family Network.

220
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:47,908
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a call out every fall when the kids go back to school.

221
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they have a school supply drive.

222
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people give, you know, notebooks, crayons, markers, you name it.

223
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:57,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a ton of supplies that come in.

224
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:02,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and they give those supplies to students, you know, that need the supplies.

225
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has access to that.

226
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:08,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so we have a lot of very charitable people in our community.

227
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:11,143
[SPEAKER_00]: They get involved in a lot of different organizations.

228
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:15,446
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Filming Network is one of my favorites.

229
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, you know,

230
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:23,612
[SPEAKER_00]: When I represented the MFN at the state level, we used to go to those meetings once a month.

231
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:28,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell everyone about the great things happening at the MFN Family Network.

232
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:35,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that people would always say to me is, how do we get a family network in our community?

233
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great that we have something like that.

234
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:40,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of other communities would love to have.

235
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,605
[SPEAKER_00]: a family network in the community.

236
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,806
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so grateful that we have it.

237
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's like a real treat about living here.

238
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:57,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, especially as being someone with young kids, being able to build a community of parents that have kids the same age, like you're saying, that will hopefully be lifelong friends.

239
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's a great place to connect with those folks.

240
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:04,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned this previously, but I mean,

241
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,641
[SPEAKER_00]: We met parents there 20 years ago that we're still friends with today.

242
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:15,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a great place to meet people.

243
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:20,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a lot of community events around that, too.

244
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a great experience.

245
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:24,645
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

246
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:29,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to move on to sort of the more fun questions, or more youth-centered questions.

247
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the rest have been fun, too.

248
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:34,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But could you tell me something about yourself that you think would be surprising?

249
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will be surprising.

250
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:53,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned, so I think people get surprised sometimes when they hear this, but so when we bought a home, my wife and I bought a home back, let's see, 17 years ago.

251
00:20:54,446 --> 00:21:04,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit, I never really thought it was that handy, but when you buy a home, of course, you're cash-strapped up to that.

252
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know,

253
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:13,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized I'm a lot handier than I thought.

254
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:20,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely will try to tackle any project I can, from painting to trying to putting in a floor and stuff like that.

255
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think people get surprised at that, because they probably don't look at me as someone who's like that.

256
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:30,786
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've learned to do a lot of things over the years.

257
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:34,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helped out, it's helped save money, which is good.

258
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I mean, I actually enjoy it, too.

259
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,995
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, I think that's kind of surprising.

260
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like that surprised you, too.

261
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:45,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It did, because to be honest with you, you know,

262
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,807
[SPEAKER_00]: As things say, sometimes we bought a house that was built in 1929, and things go, and things always need to be repaired.

263
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:59,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured, you know what, I'll try to tackle these as I can on my own.

264
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've managed pretty good so far.

265
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So fun.

266
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:05,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

267
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:05,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

268
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about any advice that you've been given that you'd want to pass on?

269
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

270
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best advice I received was from my parents.

271
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:18,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And my parents always said, you know, leave no stone unturned.

272
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:22,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, make sure you, you know, inquire, ask questions.

273
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, always

274
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:36,584
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, encourage me to be involved, be engaged in what's going on, be part of the community, you know, really, you know, try to give back, you know, and that's something that I've always done.

275
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:46,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, I try to instill those same values in my kids as well, you know, be part of the, you know, be part of the community, get involved.

276
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:51,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's always, that's something I always encourage.

277
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other piece of advice was,

278
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:57,110
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, it's, uh, um...

279
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:02,047
[SPEAKER_00]: We're born with two ears and one mouth, so we do twice as much listening.

280
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:10,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll see even on the council, I mean, I'm not someone who's yelling and screaming, and I do a lot of listening.

281
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:16,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to listen when people come up to that rail and they want to tell us what's on their mind.

282
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:25,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's always valuable, because we have a lot of issues that come before us, but it's always good to listen to the people that come before us.

283
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,865
[SPEAKER_00]: they're telling us what their issues are, or they may be just giving an opinion on something.

284
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,109
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find it always interesting to...

285
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,622
[SPEAKER_00]: find out how did they get to that decision.

286
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,963
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they usually walk us through that.

287
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:40,404
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll ask questions back.

288
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:50,770
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so to me, you know, I always, you know, listen first and get all the details and, you know, ask good questions or try to ask good questions and go from there.

289
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's I think some of the best advice I've ever received.

290
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:54,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.

291
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:55,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good advice.

292
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:58,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've been saying this to like everybody that I've been interviewing, but like that

293
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling of being listened to is, like, it's really important.

294
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also something that personally I've experienced from everyone that I've reached out to, and that ability, like, that you're, everyone's ability and, like, interest in responding to constituents has been, it's been, like, pleasantly surprising.

295
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:19,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if there's anything I've learned in my 12 years of city government is that

296
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:24,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the most important things you can do is listen to people.

297
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,181
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are coming down to the city council meeting, they have concerns.

298
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,742
[SPEAKER_00]: They have issues that need to be addressed.

299
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:37,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that one of the most important things we can do is listen to them and try to figure out, well, how can we resolve these issues, solve these problems?

300
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:44,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And even outside of that, if there's, I don't know, something going on in a particular neighborhood,

301
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:57,706
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we give people the opportunity to speak up on an issue, and that's why the city council and the school committee, they're important roles.

302
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:06,929
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that people can come down, give their opinion, and we might not always agree with them.

303
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:15,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not always agree with them, but I hear them out, and I'll be honest here, a lot of people that I might not agree with, I actually like to listen to

304
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,826
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how did they get to that point?

305
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:21,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always find that interesting.

306
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:25,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've learned a lot of things along the way just by listening to people.

307
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:32,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's probably one of the most important pieces of the job is listening to people, find out what's on people's mind, and see how we can help them out.

308
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.

309
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:35,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those were all my questions.

310
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:41,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there anything that you want to kind of talk about or anything that I didn't ask you about that you think is important for voters to know?

311
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:47,633
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I absolutely love living in Medford.

312
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived here for many years, and I want to make Medford a better place.

313
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of work that we can do.

314
00:25:56,597 --> 00:26:06,442
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place to work, play, raise a family, and I really feel that we can do better than we're doing now.

315
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:13,705
[SPEAKER_00]: $48 million that's going to be coming in from the American Rescue Plan.

316
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:22,552
[SPEAKER_00]: That can have a significant impact on our community and really give us the opportunity to emerge from this pandemic bigger and better than ever before.

317
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:28,197
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that there's a plan to spend that money.

318
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there's no plan and there needs to be community input because at the end of the day,

319
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:38,927
[SPEAKER_00]: That $48 million belongs to the taxpayers of our city.

320
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to be involved in that process.

321
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,991
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be dialogue.

322
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:48,817
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a look at our neighbors in Malden and in Arlington, they've already had community input.

323
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,639
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already had dialogue.

324
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're moving forward with the plan.

325
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no chief financial officer right now.

326
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had a chief financial officer for four months.

327
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,734
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a key role.

328
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:05,480
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to establish that plan and move things forward, we need to have a chief financial officer.

329
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's a high-priority item.

330
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:10,326
[SPEAKER_00]: But coming up with a plan for the $48 million,

331
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:12,509
[SPEAKER_00]: is key.

332
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:16,894
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going to help us emerge from this pandemic and we need to come up with a plan to do that.

333
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:25,665
[SPEAKER_00]: If elected, that's going to be one of the first things I work on is coming up with a plan with regard to ARPA and how we're going to spend that money and there'll be plenty of community input.

334
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:27,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

335
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for sharing all that.

336
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:29,809
