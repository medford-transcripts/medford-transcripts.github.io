00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:06,690
15th regular meeting, July 25th 2023 at the Medford City Council is called to order.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,791
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,512

00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:13,673

00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:26,918
I'll just say present present six present one absent, please rise to

7
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:46,269
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

8

23-374 offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Sang.

9
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,693
Whereas our community values, embraces, and celebrates diversity in all its forms.

10
00:00:53,753 --> 00:01:00,376
Whereas Disability Pride Month is recognized each year in July to highlight the accomplishments, work, and advocacy of individuals with disabilities.

11
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:05,278
Whereas our community is enriched by the contributions, perspectives, and presence of people with disabilities.

12
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:12,842
Whereas Disability Pride Month provides an opportunity to recommit to empowering people with disabilities, ensuring equal access to all spaces and opportunities in our community,

13
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,743
and recentering on areas in the city where we must improve accessibility in order to be a truly inclusive and equitable city.

14
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:24,507
Be it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and celebrates July as Disability Pride Month.

15
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,428
Councilor Collins.

16
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,381
Thank you, President Morrell.

17
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,644
Appreciate Councilor Seng for bringing this resolution forward with me.

18
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:37,706
And I also want to acknowledge school committee member McLaughlin who helped us with the idea.

19
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:43,708
And she actually liaised with Boston City Council member Mejia in Boston who worked on a similar resolution.

20
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:50,751
I loved the idea of making an official proclamation to recognize Disability Pride Month in Medford.

21
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:53,632
It's celebrated across the nation, across the world.

22
00:01:54,792 --> 00:02:09,078
disability has always existed, it will always exist, and like any other facet of diversity in our society, it should be acknowledged, it should be celebrated, and we should make sure that everybody across every spectrum of human being is adequately accommodated and embraced in our community.

23
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:09,898
Thank you.

24
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:11,639
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

25
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,079
Councilor Tsang.

26
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,193
Thank you so much.

27
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:28,043
I want to thank Councilor Collins for introducing this with me, and also thank school committee member Melanie McLaughlin for giving us for helping us with this liaising and with giving us the idea for it.

28
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,428
It's so important to make sure that all members of our community are not only seen but celebrated.

29
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:48,786
I think for too long, folks with disabilities who lived in Medford haven't always felt like part of the community, and folks who have disabilities might have felt that.

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,042
even felt that they couldn't completely be themselves in public or they had to hide something.

31
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:02,104
And, or even that disability was something to be shameful about.

32
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:03,644
And we know that's not true.

33
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:12,228
And I think it's really important for all of us to take a forceful stand to let people be proud of who they are.

34
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:16,049
And even if that means, you know,

35
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:28,819
Changing how we work at City Hall, if that means taking a deep look at our policies, if that means making sure that things are ADA compliant in Medford, those are really important steps that we need to take.

36
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:37,843
And Disability Pride Month gives us a chance for us to talk about those needed changes in our community and those needed investments.

37
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:44,806
So I'm very happy to introduce this with Councilor Collins and very much looking forward to what we can do in the future.

38
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:50,145
to address the needs of all of our residents.

39
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,705
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

40
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,325
Vice President Behrs.

41
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:55,105
Thank you, Madam President.

42
00:03:55,326 --> 00:04:01,006
Thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Sang for putting this forward, and to Member McLaughlin as well.

43
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:15,469
I think in addition to everything that my colleagues have said, something that's really key to this is what is it going to take to make sure that our streets, sidewalks, and open spaces are safe and well-maintained?

44
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:19,454
What is the funding gap there?

45
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:20,614
How are we going to get there?

46
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:37,337
We know that obviously we prioritize what everyone had just talked about around, you know, when we do a new construction project, when we do have all of these complete streets projects, we're prioritizing making sure that people with disabilities have access to our street sidewalks and open spaces.

47
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:44,299
But when we are have such a big backlog and we don't have the time, you know, we have such a long timeline to get there.

48
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,796
We also have to think about how many people are impacted by that.

49
00:04:47,836 --> 00:05:03,659
How many people can't get to the grocery store or the pharmacy or the dry cleaner or a restaurant or a park to sit in safely because the sidewalk on their street or on the main street near them just isn't in the condition that it needs to be or the ramp or the crosswalk isn't there.

50
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:09,440
So, you know, while we celebrate Disability Pride Month, you know, taking that

51
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:22,834
just taking that pride and taking those values and implementing them in action is part of what we're talking about when we're talking about our budget priorities and the need for significant additional funding to fix the city.

52
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:23,715
Thank you.

53
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:24,955
Thank you, Vice Mayor Behrs.

54
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:26,376
Any further discussion?

55
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:30,377
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Singh.

56
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:31,718
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

57
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:35,039
Vice President Behrs?

58
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:35,499
Yes.

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,920
Councilor Kerrio?

60
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,040
Yes.

61
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,120
Councilor Collins?

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,540
Yes.

63
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:49,824
Yes.

64
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:50,964
Yes.

65
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:51,445
Yes.

66
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,086
Six in the firmness during the negative.

67
00:05:54,006 --> 00:06:02,831
One absent motion passes records the records of the meeting of June 20 2023 were passed to Councilor night Councilor night is absent so they will remain table.

68
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:02,911
Yes.

69
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:18,180
Those raisin canes, those raisin canes and the budget.

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,061
I would move to approve.

71
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:51,824
Technically, I think the legal shot clocks start when we vote on it, not when we vote on the record, so.

72
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,746
Make sure there's no mistakes, that's why we approve the minutes the following week.

73
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:58,127
Right.

74
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:05,869
Yeah, like I said, I don't remember what's on there, but if there are parameters that people are waiting for things, it could be, you know, might be a little detrimental for them.

75
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,390
Mr. Navarez, have you reviewed the records?

76
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,132
I took a look at them, they've been layering.

77
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,913
Madam President, I looked at both.

78
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:18,734
You looked at them as well, Councilor Scarpelli?

79
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,475
I did, I found them all, I found them in order.

80
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:23,175
Thank you.

81
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,575
I'd second the motion.

82
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:31,276
Okay, so we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve second by Vice Mayor Behrs and these are June, I was just gonna say these are for the June 20th records.

83
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:32,397
He said both, right?

84
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:33,377
He said both, okay.

85
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:34,577
For June 20th.

86
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,437
Yeah, I have been.

87
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:41,358
I think June 20th and July 11th regular meeting records.

88
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:44,499
So motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve second by Vice Mayor Behrs.

89
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,879
Mr. Clerk, call the roll when you are ready.

90
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:47,668

91
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:51,631
Yes.

92

101
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,440
I think it's on file, and I will hand it over to Councilor Scarpelli.

102
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,962
Is the petitioner, you can come up to the mic, and then Councilor Scarpelli is the chair of the licensing commission, subcommittee.

Thank you, Madam President.

105
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:39,806
Again, I apologize.

106
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:44,371
Due to the rain, my schedule was diverted to work.

107
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,372
So I'm in and out.

108
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:48,035

But yeah, if I know this is exciting because I know

00:08:55,463 --> 00:09:08,413
Sushi is one of my family's favorite foods, but we wanted to make sure if the petitioner could give us a little brief description of their business, and then we can move on with my comments.

111
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:10,734
Good evening, everyone.

112
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:11,615

113
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:14,397
So I'm the owner for Matsue Sakaya.

114
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:18,380

So, and we also got our BNY license as well.

00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:31,818
Thank you.

120
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,741
Madam President, just a couple of questions.

121
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,482
We do see everything is in order.

122
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:40,324
The petitioner did everything they needed.

123
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:41,504
Everything is signed off.

124
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:45,327
Are you familiar with our hours or operations?

125
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:47,252
Yes.

126
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,894
Myself, I have a Chinese restaurant.

127
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:55,055
So I was the one that running the rest of the business.

128
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,236
So it's all on track right now.

129
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,397
So I pass it over to the manager over there.

130
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:05,559
And my husband, he's also a main chef for the other Japanese restaurant for more than 10 years now.

131
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,361
So I believe we can run this business.

132
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:10,901
Okay.

133
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:15,283
So the hours of operations that you're looking for, I know that

134
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,543
The business hours are 2 p.m.

135
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:21,725
to 12 a.m.

136
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:27,810
Okay.

137
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,814
I do see everything in order, and if my colleagues have any questions, I would move approval.

138
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:38,604
Thank you.

139
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:41,267
And you would just have to come back for the 12am.

140
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,392
You just have to come back for the 11 to 12 portion.

141
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:47,574
Oh, really?

142
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:48,695
Yeah, right here.

143
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,456
It's right now.

144
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:55,682
It's only requesting 10pm Sunday through Thursday and 1030pm Friday and Saturday.

145
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:57,925
That's what so

146
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:03,666
So this would be just approving for those hours, and then you could apply with the clerk's office for a special permit.

147
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,547
Is there any applications that I need to submit or?

148
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,447
Yeah, you can meet with the clerk.

149
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,368
I think that would, that might help you.

150
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:16,289
Yeah, for those extended hours, but this would approve it if we vote for it for the hours that are listed on the application.

151
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,209
Okay, all right.

152
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:17,729
Thank you.

153
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:20,070
So we have a motion from Councilor Carviello to approve.

154
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,710
Any other questions from councilors?

155
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,871
Seeing none, that motion is seconded by... Second, second.

156
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:28,943
Vice President of Affairs, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

157
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:30,684
Thank you.

158
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:31,344
Vice President of Affairs.

159
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:32,044
Yes.

160
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:33,685
Councilor Kerrio.

161
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:34,025
Yes.

162
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:34,845
Councilor Collins.

163
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,185
Yes.

164
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:36,485
Councilor Nugent is absent.

165
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:37,866
Councilor Scarpelli.

166
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:38,826
Yes.

167
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:40,746
Councilor Sanz.

168
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:41,126
Yes.

169
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,247
Councilor Morocco.

170
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:42,647
Yes.

171
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:46,148
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, motion passes.

172
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:46,708
Thank you.

173
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:47,108
Thank you.

174
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:47,608
Good luck.

175
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:58,108
23376 petition for common bishops license for so funny long for four or four seasons, but with T 34 Riverside Avenue, Medford Mass 02155.

176
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:03,092
Thank you so much and we'll just turn over to Councilor Scarpelli real quick and then we'll come back to you.

177
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,780
Okay, thank you again, Madam President and the Chair.

178
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,586
I do have all the paperwork, everything is in order, but if the petitioner could give us a brief description.

179
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:21,172
I know that boba tea is very, very popular, but just a description of your process would be important, so thank you.

180
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,155
Thank you.

181
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:26,156
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

182
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:29,339
My name is Sophanis, I'm the new owner of Four Seasons Boba Tea.

183
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,701
and I can introduce my store.

184
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:41,646
So Boba tea is kind of pearl tea or Boba tea that are made from the milk and the tea and the papayoka also.

185
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,848
So the ball and the papayoka in the bottom.

186
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:48,931
So a couple of the teas that make a lot of people interested in that drinks.

187
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:49,752
Yeah.

188
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:50,853
Thank you.

189
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:51,293
Okay.

190
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:56,897
And I see everything in order, Madam President.

191
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:58,577
I would move approval.

192
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,278
My colleagues have any questions.

193
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,180
Thank you.

194
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,341
Any questions from the council?

195
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,182
Second the motion.

196
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:05,463
None.

197
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:09,146
We have much for approval from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

198
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,187
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

199
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:10,767
Yes.

200
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:10,907
Yes.

201
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:11,007
Yes.

202
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:11,308
Yes.

203
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:11,728
Yes.

204
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:12,429
Yes.

205
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:13,129
Yes.

206
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:15,852
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

207
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:17,053
Motion passes.

208
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:26,860
Thank you so much.

209
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,044
Congratulations.

210
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:32,005
Thank you.

211
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:40,593
23-377 petition for common victims licensed by Sophia K for Ho-Win Palace 2, formerly Tiki Island, 269 Middle 6 Ave, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

212
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,796
Are you the petitioner for that one?

213
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:48,040
Or do we have a petitioner for the online?

214
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,480
Okay.

215
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:50,081
Oh, sorry.

216
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:50,562
I wasn't looking.

217
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:50,802
Okay.

218
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:54,707
Russell Chin, I will unmute you.

219
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:57,348
We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then I will also ask you to unmute.

220
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,608
So we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli first.

221
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,189
Thank you, Madam President.

222
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,269
Again, I'm glad to see with such changes.

223
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:11,491
I know we heard some sad news yesterday about a few establishments closing on Middlesex Ave.

224
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:20,933
So the very popular site of Tiki Island, I'm glad that there's someone taking this over and the reputable

225
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:23,502
owner.

226
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,904
I think this is all of the paperwork seems in order.

227
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:34,969
I think that just understanding the hours of operations that was an established business for a long time, and understanding the amount of employees.

228
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:44,715
I think that if we just got a brief description of what we're doing, and then just answer those questions, and then open it up to our call my colleagues, that'd be great.

229
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:46,316
Certainly.

230
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:47,557
Thank you very much.

231
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:48,478
Councilor Scott Kelly.

232
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:49,939
My name is Attorney Russell Chen.

233
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,900
I'm representing the applicant

234
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:59,492
Sophia Kee, she is no longer, she is not in the country at the moment, so I'm standing in for her and I apologize for her absence.

235
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:03,073
Sophia is a principal of Chen Hong LLC.

236
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:13,339
They do business as Ho Win Palace too, and they currently have an existing restaurant in Everett that she operates.

237
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,500
So this will be her second restaurant.

238
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,721
She's operated over there in Everett for quite a number of years successfully.

239
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:22,163
And she intends to bring that same type of management skill

240
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,200
and experience over to the new restaurant at Tiki Island.

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,741
I have done some little research and she is a reputable owner.

242
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:43,303
So we appreciate the opportunity to keep that business going, the Tiki Island spot going with such an owner.

243
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:50,625
So I think that the hours of operations, I'm trying to find it on the sheets that I have.

244
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:51,725
I know that-

245
00:15:53,087 --> 00:16:04,260
We had applied, I believe for 11 to 1am Monday through Saturday, Sunday, 12 to one but we understand that the city does have an ordinance in place regarding closure at 11 o'clock without a special permit.

246
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,042
We're certainly happy to honor that.

247
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:06,943
Okay.

248
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:18,013
But that's what I just wanted to make sure we had that because I know a lot of the permits leave with the existing owner and their application.

249
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:25,297
So I do see everything else in order, Madam President, I would move approval after any comments that my colleagues might have.

250
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:27,392
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

251
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:28,153
Vice President Behrs.

252
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,014
Thank you, Madam President.

253
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,896
Thank you, Attorney Chin.

254
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:35,281
You may not have the answer to this question, but I have had it asked of me a couple of times this week.

255
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:41,468
Do you know if there will be an interior renovation or if it will stay the same look inside?

256
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:57,887
My, my understanding is that it will remain primarily the same inside however there may be some updating going on after the acquisition is completed to, you know, enhance the interior and make it a better place for the patrons to feel welcome.

257
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:02,371
I know council because was saying I think the Buddha is very very important that they keep it.

258
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,333
We'd be happy to do that.

259
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:14,915
Certainly not a condition of anything, but something the presidents were interested in.

260
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,055
Thank you, Madam President.

261
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:21,397
Like Councilor Scott mentioned earlier, we had a closure on Middlesex Ave.

262
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:27,699
Thankfully, this group has stepped in to avoid another closure in that area.

263
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:33,320
I know our good friend Raymond is involved, and we welcome him back to Medford.

264
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,580
He's a former owner of Mayling.

265
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,261
So a motion for approval.

266
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:37,047
Thank you.

267
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:42,571
On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Sang.

268
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,272
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

269
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:51,237
Yes.

270
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:51,377
Yes.

271
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:51,497
Yes.

272
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:51,637
Yes.

273
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:51,777
Yes.

274
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:52,177
Yes.

275
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:08,460
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

276
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,120
Madam President.

277
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,720
Councilor Scarpelli.

278
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,241
I don't wanna waste anyone's time.

279
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:29,503
I'm gonna be popping in and out, so instead of going and asking for individual votes to move forward, I'll text Councilor Carviello when I pop back in, so I don't waste anyone's time, because I have to pop back into a program.

280
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,164
Okay, thank you.

281
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:32,604
Okay, thank you.

282
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,002
Thank you Councilors and thank you Madam President.

283
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:37,942
Thank you so much.

284
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:54,068
Okay, going to motions orders and resolutions to three dash 378, or offered by prices and bears be it so resolved the method city council by the Metric City Council that we ask the traffic commission to consider restricting trucks on Spring Street between Salem Street and Riverside

285
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,201
either by instituting a no-trucks policy or restricting trucks over a certain weight or tonnage.

286
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,141
Vice President Peers.

287
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,162
Thank you, Madam President.

288
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:09,264
We did have discussion about this at our previous meeting in public participation, and I, that night, put this on the agenda for this meeting so we could discuss it now.

289
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:22,967
I think the resolution essentially speaks for itself, but given that we do have members of the Traffic Commission here, I would like to ask if this constitutes an official submission for your agenda or not, or if you consider that it does, or how we would go about doing that.

290
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,694
You would need to submit it through the police department, Alva, the chief's office.

291
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:36,076
Okay, so if we sent this resolution to Alva, or if the clerk did, would that be sufficient?

292
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,577
I believe so, but I cannot speak for her.

293
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:39,177
Okay.

294
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:40,518
I believe that would be the case.

295
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:41,278
No one can.

296
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:42,138
Right.

297
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,139
Chief Buckley is the chair of the commission.

298
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah.

299
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,781
So, you know, the administration of the traffic commission is housed in his office.

300
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,722
Okay, great.

301
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:54,223
So we'll do that, but I think you heard, you got the message.

302
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:04,394
Okay, sure.

303
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:07,296
Thank you, Madam President, I think it comes with this on there.

304
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:11,059
I think we've all heard from many residents of the Spring Street area.

305
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,841
It is, it is quite a busy street.

306
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:21,167
Again, it's it's turning into another cut the cutthroat to get to get to wherever they're going to get you.

307
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:28,745
Especially, you know, you've got Budweiser over there, which is always going down that way.

308
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:42,289
I know that there's a lot of even smaller trucks, but I think we have to step up some kind of police enforcement, even on a smaller basis, to send the message out, I mean, that you can't do this.

309
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:48,351
I mean, we can put up all the signs we want, but unless there's some kind of enforcement, the signs really do nothing.

310
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,293
So I would ask that when we send this to the traffic commission that we ask that,

311
00:20:53,914 --> 00:21:04,138
there be at least some sporadic enforcement of it so the residents will feel that they are getting something out of this rather than just a sign.

312
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:19,863
On that point, I would move to amend the paper to include that if such a policy is approved by the Traffic Commission that there be enforcement of it by the Traffic Division and also move that

313
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:28,257
the clerk forward this resolution to Alva at the police department for submission to the traffic commission agenda.

314
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:29,539
Thank you.

315
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,482
Uh, cancer set.

316
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:37,977
Thanks, I don't need to repeat what we heard last meeting.

317
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:46,782
I mean, it's certainly very concerning for the folks who live in that neighborhood.

318
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:50,705
I thank Councilor Behrs for introducing this resolution.

319
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:59,010
I think it's important to put on record the need, at least that I see, that to redistribute

320
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:11,513
truck traffic in the city to find better paths and especially to basically encourage, find ways to encourage trucks to take bigger main roads rather than cutting through residential neighborhoods.

321
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:20,696
So be it through maybe a more general conversation on the traffic commission or some task force to develop a policy, policy suggestions.

322
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,116
I think it's a conversation to be had.

323
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:24,717
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

324
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:25,577
Any further discussion?

325
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,221
Do you have the language as amended from Vice President Behrs?

326
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:31,262
Could you read back for me?

327
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,445
So two amendments from Vice President Behrs.

328
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:38,228
One is that the clerk forward the resolution to the Traffic Commission.

329
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:48,256
The other one is to request, after discussion with Councilor Caravello, if the policy is approved, to request some enforcement of the new policy.

330
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:48,997
Thank you.

331
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:55,222
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Caravello.

332
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:55,963
All those in favor?

333
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:58,339
All those opposed, motion passes.

334
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,882
Madam President, motion to suspend to take 23-382.

335
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:11,729
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to suspend the rules to take 23-382, which is the waste contract, seconded by Councilor Collins.

336
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:12,350
All those in favor?

337
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:12,810
Aye.

338
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,531
All those opposed, motion passes.

339
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:22,797
Going to 23-382, the electronic delivery to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding contract ordinance.

340
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:24,799
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council,

341
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:42,477
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body pursuant to provisions of MGL Chapter 30B Section 12 approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into a 10-year agreement for citywide collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, organics, and recyclables, or pursuant to request for proposal number 23-0067.

342
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:46,698
The following department heads will be available to answer questions.

343
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:52,480
DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon and Planning Development and Sustainability Director Alicia Hunts, respectfully submitted.

344
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,228
Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

345
00:23:54,768 --> 00:24:00,330
So we did have at our Committee of the Whole a presentation on the process of what we're seeking in a new contract.

346
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,891
So this is a vote before the Council that would authorize the Mayor to enter into a contract.

347
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:10,873
This would not be a vote by the Council for a contract, it would authorize the Mayor to enter into that contract.

348
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:12,253
Correct.

349
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:14,654
I'm just making sure there's not a...

350
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,110
I had a few more questions.

351
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,411
Thank you.

352
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:24,676
I'm happy to go back to Councilors on the floor.

353
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:29,079
Are there any cities that currently do the every other week trash?

354
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:35,044
My understanding is not in Massachusetts.

355
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:37,867
There are in other parts of the country.

356
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:38,467
Okay.

357
00:24:42,053 --> 00:25:04,268
I felt that I should be clear that the way this is worded, we're set 10-year agreements, and it says collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, organics, and recyclables, that this is intended to cover, and we checked this with our legal staff, that it covers, if we do a separate contract for yard waste, that would be for this as well, as well as the composting.

358
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,370
Okay, so to understand,

359
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:16,133
So it would be the regular solid waste, composting, yard grease, potentially three contracts?

360
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:17,314
Potentially, yes.

361
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:19,075
At least two, likely three.

362
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:30,584
Okay, because at this point, the composters that we're looking at, they don't pair up with like a... It would be a separate contract with the composting company.

363
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,865
Okay, thank you.

364
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:35,987
Yeah, that's the only question I have at this time.

365
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,768
I did just want to know,

366
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:49,872
Myself, I know there's many people in the city that partake, since doing compost, diapers aside, since doing compost, I mean, we barely have a bag of trash a week, and we know those bins can contain two, three bags of trash.

367
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:52,094
So it's been a huge noticeable difference for us.

368
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:58,037
And I think it would be exciting, particularly in these very hot days, to have the compost picked up weekly.

369
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:00,979
So that's just a personal note there.

370
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,820
But I will go back to Councilor Carvella for more questions.

371
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,920
Thank you, Madam President.

372
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,682
I'm just, my only thing is,

373
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:12,534
Before the contract is signed, if you could bring it back to the council so we know what the actual particulars are.

374
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:20,115
I don't have a problem for the 10 years, but I kind of got sucked into a 10 year contract before without knowing what the particulars were.

375
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:25,876
So if you could just let us know at the end before what we've actually voted for.

376
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,117
Now a motion for approval.

377
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:33,058
Thank you, Councilor Correo.

378
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:33,698
Councilor Collins.

379
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:35,638
Thank you, President Morrell.

380
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,371
And thank you both, Director McKibbin and Director Hunt for being here.

381
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:44,752
Again, I appreciate our longer discussion about this and our Committee of the Whole that we just wrapped up.

382
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:52,894
Definitely, I agree with the comments that President Morrell and Councilor Carvillo just made as this gets towards finalization.

383
00:26:53,094 --> 00:27:03,597
And just for the benefit of residents who weren't watching the conversation that we had at 6 p.m., you know, I think that this, authorizing this contract, which stands to encompass

384
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:10,330
so many of our goals for getting towards zero waste, cost savings for the city, just a better experience for residents and businesses.

385
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,232
I think that this positions us to be in a very exciting place as a city and for the city.

386
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,893
You know, for me, I don't remember when recycling became the norm.

387
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:31,376
I think that happened kind of before I was a fully lucid adult, but I think we're at the point in society now where if recycling isn't available, it feels weird and it feels wrong to most people to not have that option.

388
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,337
And I think we're at a place

389
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:38,419
societally, where hopefully, you know, within the next 10 or 20 years, we'll get to that place with composting.

390
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:49,164
And that's so important for just the experience of being in our buildings and the overall waste stream, not to mention being a large emission source to not be composting these organics.

391
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:58,228
So I think that this is really exciting for the city to be in the position to be a part of that pivot in Massachusetts of institutionalizing, just something that we should be doing.

392
00:27:58,668 --> 00:27:58,928
Thank you.

393
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:01,629
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

394
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,710
Vice President Behrs.

395
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:03,977
Thank you, Madam President.

396
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:16,702
Definitely encourage folks watching now, if they have questions, to take a look at our prior meetings on the issue, including the one that we just had at six o'clock tonight.

397
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:22,425
I think there was really great answers to questions and presentation from our commissioner and director.

398
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:32,769
I think at least how I've been thinking about it in my head is you kind of had a triple mandate to make sure that we had effective and timely waste removal for residents

399
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,329
to control costs and reduce waste.

400
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:41,171
And I think there's actually a lot of conflict between those three priorities.

401
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:49,133
And I think that it seems to me that with the way the Solid Waste Task Force worked and RFP process worked, we're there.

402
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:50,674
We're not exactly where we wanna be.

403
00:28:50,694 --> 00:29:00,157
We've talked about some of those details in the prior meeting, obviously, but we're keeping controlling costs to the extent that it's gonna be the same as it was the last 10 years, not that it's actually gonna be below 2.5%.

404
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,615
So it's still rising faster than revenue.

405
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:24,532
But, you know, this seems to me with the education in the phase and timeline that we're going to have effective and timely waste removal maybe even in many cases more effective in terms of road and control, and, you know, just smell and all these other pieces of it and still getting everything out the door, more for yard waste.

406
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,034
know, same size bins, we're not going to smaller bins like we've seen in other communities.

407
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:36,882
Cost control, I mean, you know, costs are still going to be going up, they're going to be going up faster than two and a half percent, but it's not going to be

408
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,370
you know, 20%, which is good.

409
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:47,073
And I really do, the thing that really encourages me the most is that this seems to be really pushing us in a zero waste direction.

410
00:29:47,093 --> 00:30:01,881
I really appreciated the chart you brought up that showed actually how little of what the city's waste produces is just stuff that is, can't be in some way recycled or composted or otherwise tried to reuse.

411
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:05,263
And I think we all know how important that is considering

412
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:15,875
know, we talk a lot about climate change and we focus a lot about temperature and we talk a lot about whether we don't talk a lot about microplastics and pollution in the rivers and all these other pieces of it as well.

413
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:18,237
And I think this really moves us in a good direction there.

414
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:21,680
So I'm thankful for your work.

415
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,465
I'm also thankful that you that I'm also thankful that we waited to see the product of the work before approving the 10 year piece of this.

416
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:30,046
But

417
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,028
I would second the motion to approve.

418
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,469
It hasn't been seconded already.

419
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,811
And thank you for everything you've done on this.

420
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,172
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

421
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:39,013
Any further discussion from the council?

422
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:43,336
I do see Councilor Scarpelli is back.

423
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:45,418
Just flag me down if you have anything.

424
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:47,559
And I see Mr. Castaneda will get to you as well.

425
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,182
I also just want to thank you both for all your work on this as well as the Small Waste Task Force.

426
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:54,584
Jumping on what Vice President Behrs said, I think

427
00:30:56,476 --> 00:31:02,579
I work at MIT in my day job, and they just released a series of impact goals to help them reach their climate goals.

428
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:12,764
And one is around waste, and it really focuses on food waste, because I think that's what a lot of people are coming up with, that when we do pound for pound, a lot of it is food.

429
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:23,649
And that's absolutely something we can put in a different stream that goes to biofuel, that goes to compost, that goes to something that's not rotting in a landfill with everything else, and just off-gassing in a way that's completely detrimental.

430
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:44,853
as we look towards our climate goals as a city, it can feel, I think to Vice President Baird's point, we can think about heat and flooding and all these things and see them, and those, absolutely, those feel like, those are climate change, those feel like climate change, but waste is such a big part of it, and it's something that we as individuals absolutely can do to make an impact when given the right tools to do so.

431
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:49,877
So I really appreciate that forward thinking with this and looking into that and understanding that

432
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:52,635
We will explore it as we get there.

433
00:31:52,655 --> 00:32:01,117
Hopefully we can continue down the path at year three and it works great and everyone loves it, but I appreciate all the information as far as what that looks like, if it is a challenge and things like that.

434
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:08,319
So I really thank you for the time and just presenting to us on this multiple times and for all the work you put into this.

435
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:16,981
So I do see Mr. Castagnetti, if you have a question or also anyone else, I will unmute you.

436
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,900
Name and address for the record, please.

437
00:32:24,824 --> 00:32:25,985
Hello, counselor.

438
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:28,027
Yep, we can hear you.

439
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:31,076
Okay, thank you very much, Council President.

440
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:41,324
First off, someone had already chatted to your council that your volume is way too low, and it's still very low.

441
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:47,489
It's hard to understand, except when Councilor Scott Pelley spoke, that was loud and clear.

442
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:55,635
If it's possible, can you turn it up a lot louder, and we can always adjust the volume on our end to lower it, please?

443
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:03,788
Yep, we have the folks in the booth can hear you so they can work on that and vice versa and bears is turning off the fans.

444
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,328
So that will definitely help.

445
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:08,529
Thank you, thank you council.

446
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:18,832
Listen, I have two quick points about the rodents and rats and things of that nature.

447
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:23,293
Number one is I'm amazed to see

448
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,041
a lot of holes in the top of these barrels, the rubbish barrels.

449
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:33,323
And it looks like squirrels are chewing right through the lids.

450
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:37,325
It's hard to believe, but it looks like that's what's happening.

451
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:38,886
Have you noticed that?

452
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,987
Yes, and I think it's probably usually rats.

453
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:46,428
Rats will chew through anything, so it's usually rats.

454
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:52,891
I have a simple possible solution.

455
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:21,213
um to make some sort of a spray ball and fill it with maybe a hot pepper liquid or something and spray the top of the lid so they would have some hot pepper and they might stop that business you know and because i don't think they like licking the hot pepper as they're chewing you know anyways that's one if you heard it yep thank you

456
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:38,381
okay number two as far as the rubbish bottles um the raccoons are pretty cunning and they have hands and fingers they open those barrels i've seen them open the barrels they jump right in i don't know how the hell they get out or maybe they get dumped into the rubbish truck

457
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:50,110
So what I do is I put a small bungee cord, there's a hole on top of the lid in the front, and I can actually bungee cord it with a four-inch bungee, or you could tie it yourself.

458
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,172
But just make sure when it's time to go out to the track, you untie it, you know.

459
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:56,414
That was number two.

460
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,236
And I have an addendum.

461
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:03,659
Did I hear Councilor Beers say something like playoffs?

462
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,822
You mentioned that at seven o'clock earlier.

463
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:09,726
Something like what?

464
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:11,627
Playoffs.

465
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

466
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,934
I think the word was override, real estate tax override.

467
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:23,038
Yes, you heard that.

468
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,023
Okay, it wasn't a playoff, it was an override.

469
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,866
Okay, which has to be voted on by the public.

470
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,769
on election day.

471
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:34,709
It was just a discussion point.

472
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:36,090
It also has to be introduced to the council.

473
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,111
It has to be voted by the council and then voted by the public.

474
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:40,912
So it was a... I'm decreeing an override.

475
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:49,156
And hopefully if decree is the right word, then exclusions also while you're at it.

476
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:52,518
Yes, those are two.

477
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:53,438
Anyways.

478
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:54,379
Thank you.

479
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:58,533
Please not here, because we're not Winchester.

480
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:02,076
We've never had an override or exclusion in our lifetime.

481
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:02,477
Never.

482
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:03,978
Thank you for listening.

483
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:05,439
Thank you.

484
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:06,660
Vice President Behrs.

485
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:08,221
You're correct.

486
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:09,883
We have never had one, and that is the problem.

487
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:16,868
I just wanted to say, if you didn't miss it, we did have a great conversation about raccoons and rats in the 6 o'clock meeting.

488
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:22,573
And one of the things about the compost bins that Commissioner McIvern was artfully holding up

489
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:34,130
for everyone to see on camera, and I think it'll be on the recording, is that these have a lock so that the raccoons can't get in them, and also the plastic is thicker, and we do not have the rats chewing through them, to Director Hunt's knowledge.

490
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:40,072
So that would be another way to limit access to food waste for pests.

491
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:50,116
Any further discussion from the Council, or does anyone on Zoom want to see that bin if they missed it last time?

492
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:51,457
I'm sorry.

493
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,057
Did you take it away already?

494
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:55,678
It's upstairs.

495
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:58,419
It's okay, no one's- We don't need it.

496
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,960
Yeah, people can, it's on the tape.

497
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,180
Thank you so much for your earnest.

498
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,061
I really appreciate it.

499
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,922
Director Hunt always has the best interns, so appreciate it.

500
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:08,942
Any further discussion from the council?

501
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,703
Had a present roll call vote.

502
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:12,984
Yes, I believe we need a roll call vote, either right.

503
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:17,525
So we have a motion from Councilor Carriello, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

504
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:22,347
And again, this is to authorize the mayor, the city, the mayor,

505
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,771
to enter the city into a 10 year contract.

506
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,933
This is not a vote from the council on the contract.

507
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,175
This is giving the mayor the power to enter into a contract.

508
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:36,559
So on the motion of Vice Councilor Carbielos, seconded by Vice President Behrs to approve.

509
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,180
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

510
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,241
Vice President Behrs.

511
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:40,121
Yes.

512
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:41,522
Councilor Carbielos.

513
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:41,922
Yes.

514
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:43,283
Councilor Collins.

515
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:43,543
Yes.

516
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:05,297
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, the motion passes.

517
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:07,298
Thank you.

518
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,618
Thank you very much.

519
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,819
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

520
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:16,201
On the motion by Susan Ferris to revert to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

521
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:16,921
All those in favor?

522
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:17,541
Aye.

523
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:18,602
Opposed?

524
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:19,382
Motion passes.

525
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:23,785
Going to 23-379 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

526
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:28,687
Be it so resolved that Medford City Council address the recent work done at Winthrop Street slash Placedead.

527
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:33,309
Please request the attendance of Traffic Engineer Todd Blake and City Engineer Owen Wartella.

528
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:40,092
Councilor Carvalho, as you saw, neither Director Blake nor City Engineer Wartella are able to make it.

529
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:43,333
They did send us a few correspondences regarding this as well as

530
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:48,394
We have the complete streets master plan as well.

531
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:49,194
So Councilor Kerrio.

532
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:49,594
Thank you.

533
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:50,714
Thank you, Madam President.

534
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:58,536
I'm a little disappointed what happened there after six or seven years of Eversource tearing up our streets.

535
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:02,477
What the street is a gateway street into the city of Medford.

536
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:07,077
And what we get is a bunch of plastic barrels and plastic dividers there.

537
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:10,178
If we wanted an island,

538
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:13,402
or a bump out, we should have put it in.

539
00:39:13,883 --> 00:39:19,566
All we have there is a line with some sand in there, the sand's pretty much all washed away, and it looks cheap.

540
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:22,007
There's no other way to put it.

541
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:28,231
It's a cheap look with a bunch of plastic barriers telling you where to turn, and there's lines going all over the place.

542
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,793
I'm hearing people about the confusion on the lines.

543
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:40,644
So again, I wish that, you know, one of the either the director would have came or someone who came to give us some answers why they were like that.

544
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:54,647
But my biggest disappointment is, is the lack of the of the island there with just a line with some sand and those in those cheap looking barrels and that goes to part of our city's cheap curb appeal.

545
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:56,349
to say.

546
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:57,310
Gateway is safe.

547
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,971
This is the gateway into Medford.

548
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:05,716
You come out of Winchester, you don't see all the plastic cones, but we're turning into a city of plastic cones everywhere we go.

549
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,919
And I don't like the look, and the residents don't like the look of what we're seeing.

550
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,503
I'm all in for the safety and all that other stuff, but the look is not good.

551
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:20,747
It's bringing down the curb appeal of our city all over the city and not just there.

552
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:23,849
But especially that, that's a nice intersection.

553
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,510
You have the cemetery and

554
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:30,066
to see that those orange plastic there makes me sick and it makes other people sick.

555
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:32,588
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

556
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:34,289
Councilor Collins.

557
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,570
Thank you, President Morrell.

558
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,432
I appreciate Councilor Carvillo for bringing this forward.

559
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:47,656
I took some time to read over the responses from Director Blake and Engineer Wartella that they sent over in lieu of their presence here tonight.

560
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:54,620
One of the points that they mentioned is sort of in explaining

561
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,097
how the current interventions at this intersection came to be.

562
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:59,057
I thought it was very interesting.

563
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:08,219
I think they use shorthand pilot to permanence for saying why we have these plastic barriers up now, which of course are not a permanent road intervention.

564
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:17,421
And I think it illustrates to me, you know, why so many of our conversations about every operational and infrastructural issue in the city eventually comes back to money.

565
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:20,582
I think that this is an issue that it is currently on the queue of

566
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:29,550
projects where it sounds like the city would like to see a more permanent infrastructural solution, not classic barriers, not something movable, just something permanent.

567
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:41,585
The mayor should have had them put the island there.

568
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,685
This wasn't that big of a deal.

569
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:47,909
Now we're going to go back and now we're going to dig up the brand new paved street that was properly paved anyways.

570
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:52,372
So Eversource could have put in a curbing there and it wouldn't have been that big of a deal.

571
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:55,245
We can make up all these excuses.

572
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,427
I mean, it's my understanding that it wasn't within the scope of mitigation that was negotiated for.

573
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:01,889
But it wasn't in the scope that Mayor Burke negotiated.

574
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:02,329
Right.

575
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:07,352
For all the disruption they've caused the community, that should be there now.

576
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:11,494
I agree with you that that absolutely should have been negotiated for, but it wasn't.

577
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:12,195
I'm disappointed in that.

578
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:12,935
But it wasn't.

579
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:14,416
Councillor Collins, you have the floor.

580
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:15,076
Thank you.

581
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:15,777
No, no problem.

582
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:27,749
And you know no disagree with anything there I think that the point that, for me, the bottom line is, regardless of what we wish had been negotiated for at any point in the past.

583
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,895
My bottom line is now we have to do what keeps that intersection, and that road as safe as possible.

584
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:35,037
given the resources that we do have.

585
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:47,412
And right now that means the plastic barriers I think engineer Wartella, I think I have the number right so that there's been 300 incidents near that intersection the past five years, unacceptable, anything that that can make that intersection safer is what we should do.

586
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:50,215
I wish I mean this is why we talk about it all the time.

587
00:42:51,937 --> 00:43:08,147
that we can make every intersection and road and site of passage in the city of Medford as safe as possible to drastically reduce the incidence of any type of accident, because that's just the most basic service that the city should be providing the people who get around here.

588
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,528
And we're not there yet.

589
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:13,570
So I feel your frustration.

590
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:15,051
And I think that this issue

591
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:24,287
it does bring up a lot of issues that we're grappling with in the city and our lack of resources to do things that the way that we'd ideally like to see them done.

592
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:26,190
Thank you.

593
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,233
Councilor Sagan and then we'll come back to you.

594
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:28,935
Thank you.

595
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:33,017
Um, I, I totally sympathize with what you're saying.

596
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,758
Um, and agree.

597
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:43,261
Um, I think I it seems like we all agree that the should have been negotiated part of that we should have tried to get something out of it.

598
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:46,322
Um, of course, it's, it's easy to

599
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:51,145
go on counterfactuals and to think about the what-ifs.

600
00:43:51,285 --> 00:44:01,552
But I think given the situation right now with the resources that we have right now, it's a temporary solution that I think we understand why it looks like this.

601
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:07,035
I think we need to set a goal in the future of making that a place that looks nicer.

602
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:17,202
Honestly, I think it'd be ideal to put a few benches there to have that be a more community-based space now instead of being an empty space that doesn't have anything.

603
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:22,514
But this is part of why the traffic was redesigned.

604
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:29,037
And look, we hold plenty of city events there.

605
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:32,238
I normally never park around there.

606
00:44:32,258 --> 00:44:37,101
I usually am taking the bus and walking around the area and that intersection is lethal.

607
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,301
I mean, it's scary.

608
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:41,843
And it's scary to see cars drive down so quickly.

609
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:46,165
And so I'm grateful that we've made some changes and interventions to make that place safer,

610
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:51,129
especially given the fact that in the last five years, there were 300 car accidents in that area.

611
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,692
I think with the new interventions, I know they're very controversial.

612
00:44:55,752 --> 00:45:03,698
I know that there are tons of residents who aren't very happy with what's been put in place.

613
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,423
But I will say that safety is always, at the end of the day, the most important function of government.

614
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:13,786
And this does keep pedestrians safe.

615
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:15,247
Thank you.

616
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:15,968
President Bares.

617
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:42,120
Thank you Madam President, yeah I mean I think at the end of the day we're talking about redesigning roads that were designed before the modern science of road design that we have today and we know that tighter turns closer to 90 degrees and narrower lanes inherently slow and calm traffic and I understand hey I drive everywhere I'm not Justin I'm not taking the bus I'm not walking everywhere I drive everywhere, and I park everywhere.

618
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:49,992
I'm going to drive a little slower, you know, I don't like to walk very far, you know, people can make whatever jokes they want to make about the whole thing.

619
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:51,213
I'm, I'm tied to my car.

620
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:57,238
So don't, don't take me as the one who's, you know, not car dependent or wants to be car-free.

621
00:45:57,598 --> 00:45:58,279
I like my car.

622
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:02,122
I enjoy driving it and I will likely be driving a car for a very long time.

623
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,745
And I know there are people are going to be mad at me for saying that, but it's how I live my life.

624
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:12,450
That being said, if I have to drive a little bit slower because it's safer, you know,

625
00:46:13,345 --> 00:46:15,746
for everyone else in the street and for me and my vehicle.

626
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,468
I think people know that the issue of car safety is important to me.

627
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:28,652
I had a close friend who was killed because she was walking her bike on a street that didn't have proper infrastructure, didn't have curbing, didn't have lights and wasn't painted correctly.

628
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:32,133
And if that infrastructure had been there, I'd have my best friend.

629
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:34,694
That's how I think about this issue.

630
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:35,995
That's how I think about these issues.

631
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:38,709
I get it.

632
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,252
Sometimes it's frustrating to be driving a little slower.

633
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,679
Sometimes I'm frustrated sitting in a no turn on red sign that I used to take a turn on red.

634
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:53,411
But at the end of the day, I, as a driver, am not going to live the rest of my life

635
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:56,356
knowing that I had been in a, you know, situation.

636
00:46:56,376 --> 00:47:03,741
If I'm going 25 and someone lives versus I'm going 35 and someone dies because I didn't see them or whatever reason, I don't have to live with that.

637
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:06,483
The family of the person doesn't have to live with not having somebody.

638
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:11,266
And we all don't have to live with the fear of that happening to us on either end of it.

639
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:13,087
And that's how I think about these issues.

640
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:15,188
I'd like it to be permanent curbing.

641
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,129
I'd like it to look a lot nicer.

642
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:18,150
I agree with that.

643
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:35,181
I think everyone knows my position on what public utilities should be paying these companies that are taking billions of dollars of profits from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and sending it to the Netherlands every year, instead of investing it in curb cuts and beautification of our communities.

644
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:38,596
it wasn't in the scope.

645
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,157
I actually may have misspoke.

646
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:45,139
I actually don't know if that mitigation agreement was under Mayor Burke or Mayor McGlynn, so I just want to put that out there.

647
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,620
I may have not had my facts straight on that one.

648
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,021
Clearly, doing this the way that we would like to do it wasn't in there.

649
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:58,724
And I think if you look at, I think it was Director Blake's communication about the complete streets, this was like number 19 on the list.

650
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:05,807
I think we've only gotten through four of the dozens of intersections that need these kind of treatments.

651
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:15,422
have paint, we have the temporary barriers, we're going to be able to use them as a pilot program to test what the geometry of this intersection should look like.

652
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:22,924
And then, not to be the broken record again, we need to find the funding to do these kinds of projects.

653
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:31,387
We need to have funding, not just for the repairing and bringing streets and sidewalks in their existing condition to a state of good repair, but also

654
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:38,860
funding complete streets projects and safer intersections and intersections that are accessible to people with disabilities and that are multimodal.

655
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:46,585
And that sadly will mean that I get to drive five miles an hour less than I usually do and take two minutes longer to get to where I want to go.

656
00:48:48,546 --> 00:49:00,214
But at the end of the day, I don't think the issue, at least for me, it seems the issue for most people is not with the substance, with the concept, it's with the execution.

657
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:13,112
As much of that as we want to push on Eversource or ask about that being about the engineer or the traffic and transportation director, I do really think the other piece of that equation is the money.

658
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:20,639
And we know that Haines Square and Tufts Square cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars nearing millions of dollars to do similar things.

659
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,664
So if we want to do these kind of more permanent treatments, we're going to have to pay for them.

660
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:27,666
Thank you, Mr. DeVeres.

661
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,029
Thank you, Mr. President.

662
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:33,313
Again, I'm not questioning the safety aspect of it all.

663
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:37,459
I'm just questioning, Eversource was here three years longer than they were supposed to be here.

664
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,164
And the equipment was there, everything was in place.

665
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,689
The islanders could have said, while that stuff was there, it wasn't that big of a deal.

666
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:52,434
The mayor should have negotiated something with them for the extra three years of turmoil that they caused in this community.

667
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:55,297
And that was not a big cause to do that.

668
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:58,039
So that's where the rub comes up.

669
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,221
Nothing about safety, it's the look.

670
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:05,225
Three years of overdue project that should have been done.

671
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:09,383
Okay, doesn't look like that in Winchester when you drive down the street.

672
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:14,664
You don't see all the plastic cones there and the same crap because they got a different company there.

673
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,905
So this is what the difference is between the two communities.

674
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,105
Thank you, Councilor Carville.

675
00:50:20,486 --> 00:50:27,067
And I appreciate you bringing this forward and I agree with you that I wish it were a more infrastructure, a more permanent solution.

676
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:34,229
And what I'm gonna say next has nothing to do with your point, because I absolutely hear your point and I'm not disagreeing with you, but I just wanna say because

677
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,892
I'm not an expert on every intersection in this city.

678
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:42,555
I'm an expert on this intersection because I live about 300 yards from it and I walk it, I bike it, I drive it.

679
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,617
The only thing, I don't know, I don't know how to roller blade.

680
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:47,578
That's about the only thing I do not do through this intersection.

681
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:50,060
And I want to say that I am ecstatic.

682
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,761
I think it looked a little bit better.

683
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:56,323
That was, you know, there are spots in Winchester too, where the paint actually is smudged and doesn't look great either.

684
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:57,144
These things happen.

685
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:08,340
But every single, with the exception of the extremely long crosswalk about from the Whitmore Brook entrance towards the cemetery, every crosswalk in that intersection was a blind crosswalk.

686
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,522
You cross and you hoped someone saw you, whether they were coming off of Playstead, they couldn't see you cross Winthrop.

687
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,963
Whether you're crossing Playstead and they're coming off Winthrop, they couldn't see you.

688
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:25,287
Imagine having a stroller and pushing it in front of you and you hope to God someone sees you before they hit the stroller you're pushing for you.

689
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:31,335
I saw a woman a few weeks ago and the MBTA bus driver was actually extremely helpful in this situation.

690
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:31,975
He was wonderful.

691
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:33,817
And she was on the far side.

692
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:40,102
She was on the fell side and she was, she had like a walker, a roller, you know, walker with wheels and she was with her grandson.

693
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:44,745
She couldn't figure out which, which bus stop she needed to be at.

694
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,909
And she crossed over Winthrop street and then she crossed over place said twice because it's so wide right there.

695
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:53,252
And she got to the MBTA bus driver who told her actually you were in the right spot in the first place.

696
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:59,309
And I had entered the situation at that point and I had my elderly dog, would not walk any farther, so I couldn't help her.

697
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,553
So I sat there and I watched as she crossed the three streets again, and I held my breath.

698
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:08,475
I absolutely held my breath because I know how scary that intersection is.

699
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:21,623
And I just wanna know at what point we decided that that was acceptable, that for people to move as fast as they can, as they can in their cars is the more acceptable route.

700
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:25,834
than doing what we can to allow pedestrians to travel safely across streets.

701
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,035
So that's something that really frustrates me.

702
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:31,978
I've seen the discussion on Facebook that we are designing for a problem that doesn't exist.

703
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:34,459
Those people don't spend time in that.

704
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:38,301
I have seen countless people trying to cross that street.

705
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,103
Rarely someone will stop and let you cross the street.

706
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:47,527
Someone comes flying from Winchester and tries to go around them and tries to not intentionally, but almost nail someone in the crosswalk.

707
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:49,568
It's an incredibly dangerous intersection.

708
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:51,369
And since the interventions have been put in,

709
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:56,853
I've seen so many people in the area biking and walking, and it's not because they weren't there.

710
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:00,015
They have always been there, but they said, I'm not gonna cross that.

711
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:01,576
I'm not gonna walk that area.

712
00:53:01,896 --> 00:53:02,896
That area is terrifying.

713
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,198
And now they're out and they're using it.

714
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,319
And I think it's wonderful to see.

715
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:08,219
I'm really happy.

716
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,960
The barriers are a little ugly.

717
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,723
Yes, I will take ugly a million times over for safety improvements.

718
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:21,527
And I just wanna point out the fact that those very same barriers were begged for in front of some of the tonier streets in the city

719
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,911
prevent people from parking and accessing the lakes.

720
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:31,655
So those barriers exist in other places in the city that people seem to have no issue with because it prevents people from having access.

721
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:35,096
But when we add them to increase access, people get mad.

722
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,557
So I'll step off my soapbox.

723
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:44,241
But again, I probably walk through this intersection or bike through it or drive through it a half a dozen times each day.

724
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:47,042
And I want to be clear that I absolutely support

725
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:57,803
what has been done there, and I've heard from many people that support it, and I haven't heard from any people that probably don't even think to reach out, because they're biking and they're walking and they're enjoying it, and they're not thinking of emailing people about it.

726
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:01,826
So, I know we have a member of the public who would like to speak, so.

727
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:04,548
My name is Richard Orlando.

728
00:54:04,668 --> 00:54:06,929
I live on Winford Way, that same neighborhood.

729
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:09,971
I won't get on my soapbox, but I've been there since 77.

730
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:13,414
I have not seen, I would not describe

731
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:20,237
scary, lethal, that intersection is that.

732
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:38,966
Knowing that the discussion will be made about safety tonight, I've talked to, and I know we heard the report from the city engineer, from the state DOT, but I've talked to people in Medford, police officers who conduct traffic oversight of that area.

733
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:43,248
And as recent as just where I came before I came to this meeting,

734
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:47,460
A police officer over 20 years has never seen a fatality.

735
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,781
There are problems.

736
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,122
They've told me perhaps more about it went to circle.

737
00:54:55,803 --> 00:55:03,885
I hear frequently because of the line arrangement, which frankly, the design from traffic engineer point of view is lacking.

738
00:55:04,545 --> 00:55:09,987
When I hear people talk about the entrance to Medford High, I frequently hear

739
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:14,847
It's going, there's going to be head-on collisions there because of the way the lines are laid out.

740
00:55:17,228 --> 00:55:20,751
In terms of what we could have gotten out of Eversource, I hear that all the time.

741
00:55:21,471 --> 00:55:23,813
Well, you know, it's past that point and so on.

742
00:55:24,433 --> 00:55:31,438
When is Medford going to learn how to address contractors in this city?

743
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:39,323
When is the execution going to be managed correctly so we don't get the value we need?

744
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:45,676
That Winthrop Street, the lines that are on there from a design point of view are terrible.

745
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:50,758
You weave back and forth over the street, even for cyclists, it's going to be dangerous.

746
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:54,519
So the design could have been better, the execution.

747
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,980
There are lines over lines over lines.

748
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:09,763
The job, the city, the citizens of the city could have been much better represented, including all people that use that area, not just automotive,

749
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:13,665
automobiles, pedestrians, cyclists, et cetera.

750
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:23,770
I think if that's the results we get out of our design work and our execution from an engineering point of view, there needs to be a serious discussion with those people.

751
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:27,372
We should expect and demand much better.

752
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:28,273
Thank you.

753
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:29,573
Thank you.

754
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,255
Mr. Castagnani, I see your hand up.

755
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,497
Or it might be still up, but I am assuming it's up again.

756
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:37,798
I will unmute you.

757
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,170
Let me unmute myself.

758
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:43,991
Okay.

759
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:47,052
Am I getting through?

760
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:49,052
Yes, we can hear you.

761
00:56:50,052 --> 00:56:50,632
Okay, thank you.

762
00:56:50,832 --> 00:57:01,255
By the way, I did go to school also with Richard Orlando and he was one of the top three smartest kids in our class back at the Hancock School in the 50s.

763
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:05,796
Anyways, and I didn't realize he had such great common sense.

764
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,036
I would listen to that guy

765
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,600
because it's getting quite dangerous out there.

766
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,001
And that's not why I'm on.

767
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:21,306
I wanted to address, Councilor Beers talked about building Tufts Park and the money it costs.

768
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:23,408
It is my understanding

769
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:36,725
But part of Park Method's agreement with the city was they were going to take, I'm not sure of the amount, $100,000 every year to build out and build up and improve all the squares.

770
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:39,827
So far, I've only seen Tusk Square being done.

771
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:44,090
And this was done without an override or that exclusion.

772
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,531
Thank you for listening.

773
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:47,072
Thank you.

774
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:50,514
Further discussion.

775
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,795
I actually just want to make one more brief point, not to

776
00:57:53,428 --> 00:58:00,111
make a rebuttal, but again, I had seen this on social media as well, that there was a discussion point that there's been no fatalities in that area.

777
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:07,013
And I refuse to accept that that is our bar, that if someone hasn't died in an intersection, then it must be working well.

778
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:09,614
So thank you.

779
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:18,678
On the motion of Councilor Carviello to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Collins.

780
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:19,378
All those in favor?

781
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:19,698
Aye.

782
00:58:19,758 --> 00:58:20,959
All those opposed?

783
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:21,599
Motion passes.

784
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,967
23-380 offered by Vice President Behrs.

785
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:33,817
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council, the rules of the Medford City Council be amended.

786
00:58:33,837 --> 00:58:35,501
Just one second.

787
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:42,174
Be amended to include the following rule and update the table of contents to reflect the addition of the new rule.

788
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:46,678
Section 7, rules regarding council adoption of provisions of Massachusetts general law.

789
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:51,742
Rule 39, Medford City Council rule regarding consulted fees.

790
00:58:52,283 --> 00:58:56,987
The following rule is adopted pursuant to general law chapter 40A, section 9, and general law chapter 44, section 53G.

791
00:58:59,438 --> 00:59:04,802
One, when reviewing an application for, or when conducting inspections in relation to a request for special permit.

792
00:59:04,822 --> 00:59:09,946
Madam President, would you like me to suspend for, I can summarize?

793
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:13,729
Sure, we have a motion from Vice President Behrs to suspend the reading.

794
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,030
Waive the reading, sorry.

795
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,171
Waive the reading, yeah.

796
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:17,992
Yes, waive the reading.

797
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:18,592
He said suspend.

798
00:59:18,832 --> 00:59:19,293
I repeated it.

799
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:19,933
Waive the reading.

800
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:23,215
In lieu of a brief summary, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

801
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:23,636
Aye.

802
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:24,136
All those opposed?

803
00:59:24,156 --> 00:59:24,777
Motion passes.

804
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:25,457
Vice President Behrs.

805
00:59:25,517 --> 00:59:26,238
Thank you, Madam President.

806
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:27,979
This is a version of

807
00:59:28,442 --> 00:59:31,963
There's updated slightly updated version of something we had on the agenda earlier this year.

808
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:47,289
We are a special permit granting authority, the city council is in addition to the zoning Board of Appeals and the Community Development Board that gives us the ability if we adopt this rule under Massachusetts general law to require legal.

809
00:59:48,750 --> 01:00:05,255
basically outside consultants, engineers, scientists, financial analysts, planners, lawyers, urban designers, or other appropriate professionals to assist the council in analyzing a project where we're the site plan, where we're doing site plan review or special permit granting authority at the expense of the petitioner.

810
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:12,837
So if there was a large developer wanting to look at a property and we're the special permit granting authority, this would allow us to

811
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:19,705
bring on our own experts at the petitioner's expense to assist us in reviewing and considering that application.

812
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:21,586
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

813
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:23,868
Any further discussion?

814
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,291
Do we need a roll call?

815
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:31,732
I'll take a roll call.

816
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:38,496
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve to amend the rules of the City Council, seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

817
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:40,357
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

818
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:58,426
Yes, Councilor Kerrio, yes.

819
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:00,147
Councilor Collins, yes.

820
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:01,487
Councilor Nunez, absent.

821
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,168
Councilor Scarpelli is also absent.

822
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,568
Councilor Sanchez, present or wrong.

823
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:11,949
Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent, the motion passes.

824
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:19,831
I believe this is actually, he'll be back, but a TBW commissioner is gonna speak to us on this.

825
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:24,312
23-381, under communications from the mayor to honorable president and members of the city council,

826
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:41,667
Regarding proposed our core projects in excess of $250,000 dear President Morella members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body allow time for presentation by dpw Commissioner Tim McGivern of the following opera projects, ie proposed equipment purchases dpw Freightliner jet truck $358,000 and dpw loader $275,000.

827
01:01:41,707 --> 01:01:43,867
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

828
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:48,850
Sincerely, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

829
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,971
And just a reminder, this isn't anything that's asking us to vote on appropriation.

830
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:59,993
This is the mayor presenting a courtesy paper and also, I guess, getting it out to the public, letting us know about ARPA spending plans.

831
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:03,374
We do have DPW Commissioner McIver with us to tell us a little bit more about it.

832
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:06,014
Any questions as we wait for him to rejoin us?

833
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:12,716
All right, I'll give you a minute to... Hi, sorry, ARPA requests?

834
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:13,336
Yes.

835
01:02:13,836 --> 01:02:14,116
Thank you.

836
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:17,533
So these two vehicles, let me just grab it.

837
01:02:21,935 --> 01:02:28,137
So these two vehicles, the loader and the jet truck, so I believe I'm here because they are over $250,000.

838
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:35,380
They are both very high use vehicles, and they are both at the end of their life.

839
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:43,843
The jet truck is a piece of equipment that we use to clean out sewer service lines, and that piece of equipment

840
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:49,622
in need of replacement so that's that one and the loader is a critical piece of equipment for snow operations.

841
01:02:50,443 --> 01:03:01,573
So that's something that we're also trying to replace and it's at its end of life and we're spending too much time in the repair shop, so that should give you a little bit of background information on those two vehicles.

842
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:02,694
Thank you.

843
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:04,856
Motion received in place in the file.

844
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:07,859
On that motion, Councilor Cabrera.

845
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:11,642
Just one quick question Tim, if you feel like you can't answer this I'll take it to Owen.

846
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:16,913
We have a grant of location for Riverside Ave from National Grid from 2020 that's been on the table for three years.

847
01:03:18,856 --> 01:03:22,022
I'm aware of it because it started under me when I was an engineer, yes.

848
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,987
Do you think we could take it off the table, wait for them to submit a new one?

849
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:29,790
It's going to be in their court.

850
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:37,936
I believe that was because the MWRA had a project and the MWRA asked National Grid to get in front of their project.

851
01:03:38,436 --> 01:03:44,420
And then that project has been, I believe, I cannot speak for MWRA, but I believe they've changed the nature of that project completely.

852
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:48,743
So it no longer requires National Grid to expedite that work.

853
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:55,787
Okay, so it would be a national grids court on whether or not they're going to do that work or the city.

854
01:03:56,067 --> 01:04:02,992
If we had a project for Riverside Ave in queue, then we would ask National Grid to expedite their project.

855
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:09,416
Okay, so but if I if I motion for us to receive it and place it on file tonight, do you think anyone's going to be injured by that?

856
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:11,438
I don't.

857
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:17,482
I cannot speak for the petitioner and I cannot speak to the city engineer that I mean,

858
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,197
I think that's my answer at this point.

859
01:04:20,638 --> 01:04:25,259
Yes, I will take that as I have not heard any timely action on such a thing.

860
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:44,603
Off the top of my head, I know it's one of those, the one that's closer to,

861
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:47,199
Felsway.

862
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:48,460
So commercial.

863
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,300
Commercial, yeah.

864
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,821
I believe it's from commercial to Felsway.

865
01:04:55,623 --> 01:05:09,609
So the National Grid project was further up, and also there's a difference too, because MWRA's project was replacing a massive utility line, and basically National Grid's utilities were in the way of that work.

866
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:14,971
So from what we understand, obviously we work with National Grid on the regular in the engineering division,

867
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:19,633
that isn't something that they need to replace on the immediacy.

868
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:24,434
So it would be something that I think if they had their way, it would be many years away, so.

869
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:32,916
It's a different section of road.

870
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:37,137
Yeah, the way it typically works with the coordination is we sit down a couple of times a year with National Grid.

871
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:38,277
We say, here's what we want to pave.

872
01:05:39,118 --> 01:05:40,858
If you guys want to do any work, you need to do the work.

873
01:05:41,393 --> 01:05:45,997
And then to give them a certain amount of time to do it, and if they don't do it, we have to move forward with our project.

874
01:05:46,558 --> 01:06:00,029
So we coordinate the best we can but I know you have noticed in the past sometimes things fall through, and they'll have to perfect example is when the square, because right now there was a couple leaks that opened up in the square and everybody's

875
01:06:01,379 --> 01:06:01,539
right?

876
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,266
So we do the best we can to sit down with National Grid and say, hey, we're going to do this, this, this, this.

877
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:08,827
So you guys need to go do your work.

878
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,169
And they do the same in my back.

879
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,691
They say, we want to do this, this, this.

880
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:14,053
So you guys should replace your water lines and put it in paving queue.

881
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:14,814
So it happens both ways.

882
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:20,220
Yeah.

883
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:30,538
One of the reasons why we, well, I can't speak for him, but when it comes up, more details he can give, because he's doing the day-to-day coordination.

884
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:31,979
So, okay.

885
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:32,860
Thank you.

886
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:33,860
All right, thank you very much.

887
01:06:34,021 --> 01:06:34,361
Thank you.

888
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:35,882
We still have to vote on 23-31.

889
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:37,423
So just the motion to receive and place on file.

890
01:06:37,483 --> 01:06:37,663
Second.

891
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:39,464
Seconded by Vice President Behrs.

892
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:40,065
All those in favor?

893
01:06:40,085 --> 01:06:40,145
Aye.

894
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:41,205
All those opposed?

895
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:41,946
Motion passes.

896
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,728
That's the public participation.

897
01:06:44,828 --> 01:06:49,431
Is there anyone who would like to speak for public participation, either in person or on Zoom?

898
01:06:52,895 --> 01:06:52,995
one.

899
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:56,117
Seeing none.

900
01:06:56,138 --> 01:07:00,981
Motion to take papers 20-600-22-547 and 23-072 off the table and receive and place on file.

901
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:02,983
20-600 you lost me right off the first one.

902
01:07:03,003 --> 01:07:03,083
20-600-22-547-23072.

903
01:07:26,082 --> 01:07:30,884
Okay, on the motion of Vice Mayor Behrs to take those papers off the table and receive in place on file.

904
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:40,467
And they are that national grid grant of location, a spending moratorium and the trash and solid waste collection contract.

905
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:42,028
Seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

906
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:43,268
All those in favor?

907
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:43,848
Aye.

908
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:44,549
All those opposed?

909
01:07:44,589 --> 01:07:45,309
Motion passes.

910
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:48,750
Papers are taken off the table and received in place on file.

911
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:50,871
Councilor Sanz.

912
01:07:52,670 --> 01:08:07,982
Just quickly before we adjourn tonight, since we're having a forecasted heat wave the next few days, we just wanted to announce that we will have some cooling centers open for residents over the next few days until July 28th.

913
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:17,709
So we have three three cooling sensors announced there's on the Metro Police Department community room, which will be at 100 Main Street that's available 24 hours a day.

914
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:23,033
The Medford Senior Center at 101 Riverside have will be open from 8am to 6pm.

915
01:08:24,874 --> 01:08:39,768
And the Metro Public Library at 111 High Street will be open from 9am to 9pm on the 26th and 27th, which is Wednesday and Thursday, and then it's from 9am to 6pm on Friday on the 28th.

916
01:08:41,782 --> 01:08:47,426
If you want more information about it, this info is on the city website.

917
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:50,147
But I hope everyone stays cool, stays safe.

918
01:08:52,009 --> 01:08:59,934
I think it speaks to the impact of climate change at the local level when we need to make announcements like this and make measures like this.

919
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:09,960
And hopefully this really kicks us into gear with more aggressive climate action and with things like just planting more trees and preventing heat islands in the city.

920
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:11,021
Thank you.

921
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:11,281
Thank you.

922
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:11,642
Thank you.

923
01:09:11,662 --> 01:09:12,082
Thank you.

924
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:16,087
Thank you.
