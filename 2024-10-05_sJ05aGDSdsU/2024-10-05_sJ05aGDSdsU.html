    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2.548s">15th</a>  regular meeting, July 25th 2023 at the Medford City Council is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=6.71s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=8.911s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=13.292s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=16.214s">Tonight.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=19.735s">I'll</a>  just say present present six present one absent, please rise to</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=44.068s">Announcements,</a>  accolades, remembrances, reports, and records. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=46.289s">23-374</a>  offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=49.951s">Whereas</a>  our community values, embraces, and celebrates diversity in all its forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=53.753s">Whereas</a>  Disability Pride Month is recognized each year in July to highlight the accomplishments, work, and advocacy of individuals with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=60.936s">Whereas</a>  our community is enriched by the contributions, perspectives, and presence of people with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=65.358s">Whereas</a>  Disability Pride Month provides an opportunity to recommit to empowering people with disabilities, ensuring equal access to all spaces and opportunities in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=73.379s">and</a>  recentering on areas in the city where we must improve accessibility in order to be a truly inclusive and equitable city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=79.203s">Be</a>  it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council recognize and celebrates July as Disability Pride Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=84.807s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=86.161s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=89.322s">Appreciate</a>  Councilor Tseng for bringing this resolution forward with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=92.684s">And</a>  I also want to acknowledge school committee member McLaughlin who helped us with the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=97.766s">And</a>  she actually liaised with Boston City Council member Mejia in Boston who worked on a similar resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=103.728s">I</a>  loved the idea of making an official proclamation to recognize Disability Pride Month in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=110.771s">It's</a>  celebrated across the nation, across the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=114.792s">disability</a>  has always existed, it will always exist, and like any other facet of diversity in our society, it should be acknowledged, it should be celebrated, and we should make sure that everybody across every spectrum of human being is adequately accommodated and embraced in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=129.618s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=130.838s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=131.659s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=132.533s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=133.654s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Collins for introducing this with me, and also thank school committee member Melanie McLaughlin for giving us for helping us with this liaising and with giving us the idea for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=149.504s">It's</a>  so important to make sure that all members of our community are not only seen but celebrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=158.092s">I</a>  think for too long, folks with disabilities who lived in Medford haven't always felt like part of the community, and folks who have disabilities might have felt that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=171.48s">even</a>  felt that they couldn't completely be themselves in public or they had to hide something. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=177.702s">And,</a>  or even that disability was something to be shameful about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=182.164s">And</a>  we know that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=184.165s">And</a>  I think it's really important for all of us to take a forceful stand to let people be proud of who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=192.588s">And</a>  even if that means, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=197.174s">Changing</a>  how we work at City Hall, if that means taking a deep look at our policies, if that means making sure that things are ADA compliant in Medford, those are really important steps that we need to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=209.819s">And</a>  Disability Pride Month gives us a chance for us to talk about those needed changes in our community and those needed investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=217.963s">So</a>  I'm very happy to introduce this with Councilor Collins and very much looking forward to what we can do in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=226.604s">to</a>  address the needs of all of our residents.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=230.925s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=232.665s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=234.145s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=235.326s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng for putting this forward, and to Member McLaughlin as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=242.687s">I</a>  think in addition to everything that my colleagues have said, something that's really key to this is what is it going to take to make sure that our streets, sidewalks, and open spaces are safe and well-maintained? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=257.053s">What</a>  is the funding gap there? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=259.534s">How</a>  are we going to get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=260.814s">We</a>  know that obviously we prioritize what everyone had just talked about around, you know, when we do a new construction project, when we do have all of these complete streets projects, we're prioritizing making sure that people with disabilities have access to our street sidewalks and open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=277.798s">But</a>  when we are have such a big backlog and we don't have the time, you know, we have such a long timeline to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=284.935s">We</a>  also have to think about how many people are impacted by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=287.836s">How</a>  many people can't get to the grocery store or the pharmacy or the dry cleaner or a restaurant or a park to sit in safely because the sidewalk on their street or on the main street near them just isn't in the condition that it needs to be or the ramp or the crosswalk isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=304.219s">So,</a>  you know, while we celebrate Disability Pride Month, you know, taking that <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=311.53s">just</a>  taking that pride and taking those values and implementing them in action is part of what we're talking about when we're talking about our budget priorities and the need for significant additional funding to fix the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=323.394s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=324.155s">Thank</a>  you, Vice Mayor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=325.635s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=327.356s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=330.757s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=334.298s">Vice</a>  President Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=335.299s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=337.32s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=337.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=338.54s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=339.4s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=346.842s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=349.924s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=351.225s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=351.645s">Six</a>  in the firmness during the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=354.006s">One</a>  absent motion passes records the records of the meeting of June 20 2023 were passed to Councilor Knight Councilor Knight is absent so they will remain table. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=362.851s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=372.718s">Those</a>  raisin canes, those raisin canes and the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=378.2s">I</a>  would move to approve.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=407.923s">Technically,</a>  I think the legal shot clocks start when we vote on it, not when we vote on the record, so.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=414.305s">Make</a>  sure there's no mistakes, that's why we approve the minutes the following week.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=417.907s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=418.427s">Yeah,</a>  like I said, I don't remember what's on there, but if there are parameters that people are waiting for things, it could be, you know, might be a little detrimental for them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=427.07s">Mr.</a>  Navarez, have you reviewed the records?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=429.09s">I</a>  took a look at them, they've been layering.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=434.172s">Madam</a>  President, I looked at both.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=437.414s">You</a>  looked at them as well, Councilor Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=438.874s">I</a>  did, I found them all, I found them in order.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=442.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=443.775s">I'd</a>  second the motion.</p>
