    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4880.589s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4882.99s">It</a>  is my hope that everyone had the opportunity to spend quality time with their family and friends over the holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4891.107s">We</a>  at the Medford Public Schools have been diligently working to bring forth a plan for a new year that provides a renewed sense of safety and a means to highlight the many accomplishments and opportunities provided at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4908.105s">Often</a>  a tragic situation takes the focus away on what is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4913.877s">And</a>  I feel compelled to state that the Medford Public Schools, in particular Medford High School, has a tremendous amount of good going on daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4926.341s">As</a>  I had stated prior to school break, so many of our students were actively involved in helping others to have a nice holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4938.203s">The</a>  Friday before the holiday break, students at Medford High School were decorating gingerbread cookies, playing holiday carol music with their guitars. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4950.591s">The</a>  senior class of 2023 enjoyed their senior breakfast, complete with their pajamas on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4959.396s">There</a>  was a bagpiper strolling in the hallways at the end of the day to bid farewell to one of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4966.124s">and</a>  there were plenty of blow-up characters in the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4971.127s">Seeing</a>  all of these things, it definitely made my heart sing that our high school students were able to leave for vacation on a positive note. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4981.233s">Our</a>  teachers, working with central administration, wanted all of the students to leave for the holiday break with a positive experience, and they truly went above and beyond to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4994.44s">I</a>  thank them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=4997.096s">While</a>  it doesn't wash away what has happened, it does allow me to focus on a quote by author Melanie Beatty. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5004.7s">The</a>  new year stands before us like a chapter in a book waiting to be written. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5012.043s">As</a>  a community, we must come together in order to write that new chapter. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5018.092s">I</a>  know that the mayor, the school committee, central administration, our counseling and behavioral health office staff, along with teachers, administrators, and the Medford Police Department had not stopped over the holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5033.923s">Our</a>  school community can only achieve peace and greatness if we do so collaboratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5042.04s">As</a>  I announced last Thursday, we produced our 10 point action plan for safety, transparency and accountability at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5052.27s">I</a>  plan to discuss that plan more in depth later this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5058.475s">However,</a>  let me state once again, that our top priority has always been to provide a safe and secure learning environment for all our students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5068.743s">As</a>  Mustangs, we know a positive school culture is paramount to providing quality and supportive education. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5077.569s">This</a>  is our time to move forward together with attitudes and knowledge to help our students reach their academic and personal potentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5087.336s">Our</a>  students, staff, and families require nothing less. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5093.981s">On</a>  that, I would like to share an important information note. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5100.953s">that</a>  the Massachusetts Behavioral Health, the helpline is now available, it's live. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5109.622s">I</a>  wanna thank member McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5114.467s">Whether</a>  there is a crisis or you are unsure where to turn, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5120.208s">Now</a>  there is a number that you are able to call or text, and that number is 833-773-2445. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5125.072s">Again,</a>  that number is 833-773-2445. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5137.484s">773-2445.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5141.067s">Additionally,</a>  please note that there are 25 designated community behavioral health centers across the state, which can be accessed regardless of your insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5155.021s">These</a>  centers can be utilized for all behavioral health evaluation and treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5162.13s">The</a>  center that will assist Medford residents is located at Cambridge Health Alliance, 1493 Cambridge Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5172.083s">And</a>  their number is 833-222-2030. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5179.921s">Again,</a>  the number is 833-222-2030. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5184.883s">And</a>  if people want to look and do research for additional information, you can go to mass.gov slash community behavioral health centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5201.048s">I'd</a>  like to transition and just share a few key updates of things that will be going on in the district this coming week and next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5213.427s">This</a>  week on January 11th, our rec department will be inviting all students with the half day to skate at La Conte Ice Skating Rink for free until two o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5227.875s">Skates</a>  are available to rent for $5. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5229.896s">So</a>  if families are looking for something to do with their students, that is available and we thank the Medford rec department for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5239.173s">Also,</a>  on January 11 CPAC will be hosting their monthly meeting featuring Tom Santacondro on making transition documents easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5251.042s">That's</a>  a Zoom meeting. <a

href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5259.124s">This</a>  Friday, Medford Family Network will be hosting Family Fun Night at the high school gymnasium with knuckle bones and that's going to be from 4.30 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5274.924s">at</a>  Tufts University on January 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5277.568s">It's</a>  the fifth annual Tufts Classic Cup for both Somerville and Medford High School basketball teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5287.861s">It's</a>  taking place at Cousins Gym. <a

Tufts is requesting if you are able to donate a non-perishable food item, which will be donated to the Mystic Community Market in Medford and Project Soup in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5312.407s">Again,</a>  donations can be canned food, household cleaning items, feminine hygiene products, baby diapers, and toiletries. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5323.45s">On</a>  January 16th, there is no school in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5330.231s">Day.</a>  <a

the rabbit and the rabbit embodies the yin or the passive principle of the universe, which means the new year will bring with it the hope that people will be able to lead a more relaxed and balanced life. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5478.692s">I</a>  would like to wish our Asian families <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5481.974s">who</a>  celebrate Lunar New Year, a happy and healthy Lunar New Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5487.017s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5489.078s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5491.019s">Next</a>  up, we have number two report on world language update, Dr. Vilma Bebo. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5497.602s">Bebo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5498.302s">Bebo,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5499.403s">World</a>  language coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5500.984s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5501.384s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5505.066s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5511.192s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5512.493s">Next.</a> </p>

    <p>[_OvxNEIZPH8_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5514.596s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to offer you a mid-year update on the world language program and department. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5520.542s">The</a>  program of study, a series of courses and other educational program offered at Medford High School and Vocational Technical High School will include a new world language course description. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5534.056s">The</a>  new description will reflect the actual national standards and is divided in three major communicators levels novice grades six eight intermediate grades 1012 and advanced AP courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5551.857s">Before</a>  the course description, there will be four paragraphs to introduce the World Language Program at Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5557.242s">The</a>  first paragraph is the department mission statement, which states that the Medford Language Program at the Medford Public Schools provides students with the necessary tools to become global citizens and learners committed to understanding and appreciating their own culture, as well as the culture of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5575.197s">The</a>  program strives to empower students by broadening their perspectives, applying their language and presentational skills to real life situations, and nurturing empathy for others. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5587.128s">Furthermore,</a>  the program is committed to inspiring all students to find joy in language learning and applying their knowledge to other disciplines. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5596.331s">As</a>  a result, students will develop the skills to be successful in today's job market and feel fully competent and well adjusted in today's diverse world. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5608.017s">The</a>  second paragraph describes the world language program at Medford and states that world language courses in Medford public schools follow the proficiency model of language instruction reflected in Massachusetts State curriculum frameworks and the national standards for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5623.812s">Students</a>  are presented with grammar and vocabulary in context and are encouraged to express themselves in the target language independently of a text as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5634.736s">Awareness</a>  of cultural differences and similarities is essential to complete language education. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5641.479s">Interdisciplinary</a>  teams allow students to use the language they acquire to learn about their world in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5647.881s">They</a>  also demonstrate a more authentic use of the language to communicate important <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5653.47s">information.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5656.132s">The</a>  third paragraph describes the world language program at Medford and states that a minimum of two-year iSchool world language courses sequence is recommended for students seeking admission to competitive colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5668.359s">Our</a>  curriculum does not focus on standardized tests other than the advanced placements exams and the sealable literacy exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5676.021s">However,</a>  students who are completed the Spanish, French, or Italian intermediate honors have been introduced to their full continuum of grammatical concepts in ample vocabulary. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5686.05s">In</a>  most cases, this prepares students with the skills necessary for success on the SAT subject tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5692.535s">Colleges</a>  express no preference among languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5697.571s">The</a>  fourth paragraph describes the sealable literacy, but for high school students may be eligible to receive the sealable literacy upon graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5705.778s">The</a>  sealable literacy is an award given by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in recognition of students who have studied and attained a designated level of proficiency in two or more languages, including English by high school graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5720.404s">The</a>  criteria are a rating of intermediate I or above evaluated via testing, the measures on language skills, reading, writing, listening and speaking, and a score of proficient or above on the high school ELA and CAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5737.637s">Students</a>  fluent in a language not taken at school also qualify to test for the seal of literacy we encourage students to continue their study of language to our high school as multiple years of study will provide the opportunity to this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5755.279s">After</a>  the fourth paragraph, there is a sentence that introduces the various levels of proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5760.504s">The</a>  sentence reads, the following is a description of a communicator in the target language when enrolled in a particular course. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5768.212s">This</a>  is aligned with the American Council for the Teaching of World Language Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5773.117s">This</a>  visual on your left represents the path to second language proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5779.684s">You</a>  can see the path starts from novice low to novice mid, novice high, intermediate low, intermediate mid, intermediate high, up to advanced low. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5793.478s">In</a>  the box, this is an example of a description of the novice low communicator or what students can do at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5803.177s">Next,</a>  there is an example of intermediate low. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5807.239s">Again,</a>  what students can do at this level with this communicator. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5812.0s">And</a>  finally, we have an example of advanced low communicator, or what students can do at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5819.583s">Please</a>  note that the program of study will reflect all level of proficiency, seven total, novice low, mid, and high, intermediate low, mid, and high, and advanced low. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5830.31s">So</a>  all stakeholders can refer to them, and we allow more clarification on what students can do with the language in each level. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5840.258s">Next,</a>  we have an example of a course description which clarifies what students should be able to do at the end of Spanish, for example, Spanish, French, and Italian 2CP. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5852.027s">The</a>  target level is Novice I, and the prerequisite to take this course is Novice Med. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5858.479s">By</a>  the end of this course, the students will be one step closer to the intermediate level, which is in the middle of the path to proficiency in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5867.102s">And</a>  then we have an example of another course description, which clarifies what students should be able to do at the end of Spanish or French in Italian to honors. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5876.806s">The</a>  target level is intermediate to low, and the prerequisite to take this course is novice high. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5883.809s">At</a>  the end of this course, students will be one step closer to the intermediate level. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5892.854s">Next</a>  is an update on the online program. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5896.28s">I</a>  met with each online educator to discuss the online courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5900.863s">These</a>  are the updates as of December 22nd, 2022, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5906.086s">Online</a>  courses are using Google Classroom, which provides weekly posting, alignments, reminders, additional material, and communication to both students and parents and caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5918.834s">Next.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5920.174s">There</a>  are some additional material platforms the educator are using with their online courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5925.287s">Note</a>  how this additional support aims to develop and support all four essential skills to become proficient in a word language. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5933.17s">All</a>  of these additional supports, they support either reading, writing, listening, and speaking, or all of the above. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5941.973s">The</a>  assessment and grading are not aligned among the online courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5946.315s">It</a>  is my goal to align the online curriculum with the in-person to reflect the national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5951.684s">The</a>  department is currently working on curriculum alignment with the new Massachusetts framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5959.586s">These</a>  are the online educators' feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5962.167s">FluentU</a>  is a platform to support the online courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5965.248s">However,</a>  most educators find it limited in material access. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5969.71s">All</a>  educators want to have a meeting time with students and mandate once a week meeting so they can catch up, ask questions, and get help. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5977.682s">If</a>  students are provided with the time built into their schedule to meet with their teacher once a week, perhaps they could use that time to catch up on some work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5988.966s">Parents</a>  appear to be satisfied with the online program and appreciate all the information they can get from the educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5995.421s">The</a>  next step is to have a survey from online students and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=5999.283s">How</a>  they feel about the online courses, how satisfied they are with the type of technology and software they are using, how they are learning the skills and knowledge necessary for success in language, how much time they spend in the online courses on a weekly basis, what is the primary reason to opt to be enrolled in the online course, and if there is anything else that they would like to tell us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6028.737s">And</a>  finally, I would like to share that I teach an adult Italian class starting this Thursday once a week in the evening at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6036.859s">I</a>  am not compensated for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6039.34s">Instead,</a>  this group will donate a scholarship for seniors in the World Language Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6047.062s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6049.143s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6049.923s">Thank</a>  you so much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6050.943s">Cabot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6051.404s">Any</a>  questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6055.06s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6055.601s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6056.421s">Oh,</a>  you have a question member miss stone.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6058.864s">Thank</a>  you very much for all that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6060.966s">Is</a>  there any conversation about adding another language to the world language department I know in the past people had emailed, both for Chinese Arabic, or even sign language and I didn't know if that was a conversation to expand the languages we offer.</p>

    <p>[_OvxNEIZPH8_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6075.523s">Yes,</a>  of course, we're always open to have those wonderful conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6079.004s">I</a>  already had a little teeny tiny conversation with my supervisor, and I'm open to have more in-depth conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6086.625s">I</a>  would like to survey the district as well, see how parents and students feel about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6092.166s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[_OvxNEIZPH8_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6093.106s">Of</a>  course, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6094.306s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6094.726s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6097.527s">We</a>  have number three, report on updated Medford High School's safety plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6102.288s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6108.68s">Good</a>  evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6109.561s">So</a>  this evening, I wanted to share with the committee the key steps that we have taken at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6123.812s">The</a>  first piece being, this is a black and white version, but this is an updated student guide to the school safety <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6135.833s">procedures</a>  that we have at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6139.716s">And</a>  so, many of the in light of what ended up transpiring we realized that there were a lot of things that we could do in the immediate <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6151.127s">to</a>  ensure that the school would get right back on track and instill a greater sense of security and safety for all, which is what our primary goal was. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6164.589s">I'm</a>  going to start with the 10 point action plan, which highlights some of the key initiatives that we did as a district from December through where we are right now with the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6182.26s">The</a>  first step, and this was in collaboration with the Medford Police Department and working closely with Chief Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6192.498s">We</a>  were able to add have an additional school resource officer assigned to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6201.381s">So</a>  we now have two full time school resource officers based at Medford High School, providing support and <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6213.376s">You</a>  know, again, right now we have one male and one female school resource officer and Chief Buckley does have a few other officers that have been changed, but at any given point in time we will have two officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6228.041s">So,</a>  a few others have been trained and we may. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6231.602s">rotate</a>  some of them as time goes on, but we will always have to school resource or school resource officers assigned to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6240.845s">So,</a>  I was very pleased we were able to work on that over the break, and with our return to school on January 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6249.868s">Since</a>  then, we have had two assigned and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6253.629s">Julia</a>  Pottier is our second school resource officer and Mr. Conway has been our school resource officer as well this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6266.893s">One</a>  of the second areas where we made significant changes were related to the bathroom occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6277.464s">At</a>  the time of the incident that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6280.725s">There</a>  was definitely an incredibly large number of students that were in the restroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6286.428s">I</a>  still ask myself how did they fit in there, but there were a significant amount of students that were in the restroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6295.271s">So</a>  one of the things that we did immediately was to <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6300.333s">look</a>  at the structure of the high school, identify the most frequently used restrooms that are there, and to have bathroom monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6311.796s">There</a>  is signage on the bathrooms right now that say occupancy, no more than two students at a time allowed in the restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6323.94s">I</a>  have been administrators, teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6330.262s">building</a>  monitors the rotation, everyone all hands on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6335.285s">And</a>  so, when we're doing the bathroom duty or monitoring the students are also self monitoring as they're coming in and coming out, you know students have said oh two people are already inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6348.394s">I'll</a>  wait my turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6350.015s">and</a>  they wait patiently and that bathroom occupancy putting a limit has really helped to make sure that people just use the facility go in and go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6363.483s">And</a>  that has made truly a significant difference since we've been back. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6370.107s">A</a>  third shift that has happened is in regards to identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6378.453s">Now</a>  we are going to be having all of our students wear their school based IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6384.115s">And</a>  we know that some identification or school IDs may have been lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6389.637s">So</a>  new IDs were ordered for all students again, and they should be coming in shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6396.62s">And</a>  we're waiting for the additional lanyards that will be coming in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6405.722s">So</a>  that is something I happen to have my ID on me, but all the students will be wearing their ID and they will have breakaway lanyards. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6417.571s">So</a>  that's something that was important for us to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6422.755s">In</a>  terms of supervision in the hallways, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6428.158s">In</a>  the cafeterias, and in the bathrooms, we do have increased presence increased duty schedules, where we look in staff and administration have filled in those blocks to continue to supervise and monitor what's happening in the hallways what's happening at check in. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6454.116s">Students,</a>  when they come to school if they are tardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6457.761s">They</a>  now report to the main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6460.965s">So</a>  when they come in, they go up the front stairwell, and they go into the main office and that's where they're processed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6469.897s">We</a>  used to welcome students at the individual house offices, C1, C2, and C3. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6477.264s">Now</a>  we have it in one central location where all students are processed if they are tardy, and then they are able to go to whatever classroom they need, period, that they should be attending. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6492.037s">Number</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6495.498s">Ensuring</a>  that all students and adults are aware of procedures related to bullying prevention reporting and investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6508.543s">student</a>  sessions, the first day, the following day when we had come back from school, we had student sessions by ninth grade, 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6522.406s">Also</a>  within the updated guide, we have active links regarding bullying and what steps <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6532.228s">And</a>  there's an appendix, and it says properly investigating claims of bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6539.412s">And</a>  they give the page numbers as well, pages 44 to 46, which refers to the hard copy handbook that all students received. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6551.7s">In</a>  addition to that, step number five, the anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6560.387s">On</a>  January 18th, next week, our students are going to be trained with the see something, say something anonymous reporting tip line, where students will be trained, they'll be able to download the app on their phones if they have it, and it will be anonymous, and they will be able to report <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6587.123s">something</a>  that they're aware of and that it will, again, if people felt intimidated or they were worried about it, this is now an additional measure where they will be able to report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6598.712s">And</a>  it's not only something that could be happening, it could be evidence of seeing inappropriate graffiti or hate speech or other things that shouldn't be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6612.622s">This,</a>  again, is an opportunity for students to be able <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6616.425s">to</a>  report anonymously administrators have been trained, and we are continuing to train teachers will receive training so they'll understand how this program works at when this coming Wednesday's professional development session, Michelle men will be rolling out that training. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6639.145s">And</a>  then students will be trained next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6643.108s">I</a>  believe it's the 18th on how that program works so we're looking forward to that anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6651.713s">Again,</a>  as I mentioned earlier, number six we updated the student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6656.896s">and</a>  gave an abbreviated 10 page section, which, you know, gives the key areas where they have either been shifts or adjustments made to the student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6670.681s">For</a>  number seven, we're reminding all families and students about all of the counseling support services and in my remarks today. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6680.231s">In</a>  addition to care solace. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6684.035s">I</a>  did mention that there is now the Massachusetts behavioral helpline which is available for the entire school community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6696.783s">Bullet</a>  number eight, which will be part of my next presentation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6703.947s">We</a>  have hired and are working with the person of Mr. Michael Welch to support our high school administrative team. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6712.831s">And</a>  really look at the high school in particular focusing on culture, climate, looking at discipline safety for the remainder of this year providing consult and guidance to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6731.698s">We</a>  will be administering parent and student surveys through panorama education. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6741.429s">This</a>  is, it's a confidential school culture and climate survey, and our high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6748.716s">My</a>  parents and guardians and some of our school committee members met this week with today's Monday so they met last week with Dr. Cushing, and we're giving additional suggestions in input for things that could possibly be added to the survey so we are continuing to take that feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6769.371s">Also</a>  to help the school with. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6773.994s">emergency</a>  communications, we will be working, looking to hire a dedicated communications director who will be able to help us with comprehensive communications district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6790.005s">So</a>  those are the 10 key points of the action plan of things that have been taking place since school started last week and things that we're going to continue to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6803.655s">but</a>  I also want to just highlight a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6807.456s">First,</a>  you can see these are one of the measures that will be going out to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6813.638s">This</a>  blue bathroom pass is for the restrooms and all teachers will be receiving these passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6823.38s">So</a>  as students are in the hallway, if they're going to the restroom, they will have a pass, it will be labeled, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6831.102s">with</a>  the classroom that they're coming from, so that they're able to go to the restroom, and it's easily identifiable, they can go and return to their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6841.571s">If</a>  a student needs to leave the classroom for a different purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6846.435s">We</a>  are also instituting <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6848.877s">The</a>  red hall pass, and the red hall pass can be a student going to the nurse's office, going to visit a guidance Councilor, possibly, you know, they need to go to the library for something or the main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6861.641s">So</a>  teachers will be given these passes, they will be labeled. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6866.682s">And</a>  as students are traveling through the hallways, we'll be able to identify why they are in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6875.305s">Any</a>  adult who's monitoring at that point in time will be able to just know that we can give an account for where they are at. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6883.712s">We</a>  also still have the eHaul Pass system, which is an online system where the students can go online, they can have the app on their phone, and they can use that system as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6897.611s">and</a>  that can be checked by teachers or administrators who are on duty to look at the E-Haul Pass system. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6906.733s">So</a>  since the event took place, we have had the information system meetings with students where we did discuss the key shifts that were taking place with the guide, but we also had several listening sessions and we are going to continue to provide students with opportunities <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6926.383s">to</a>  share their thoughts, and I can say that I had students come and visit me I met with students in my office I met with students in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6937.107s">The</a>  mayor also attended one of the listening sessions in the information session for students <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6944.93s">When</a>  school reopened, we also had listening sessions for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6950.814s">And</a>  we are just continuing to provide those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6954.217s">I</a>  had the opportunity to walk the halls one day last week with member Hays, who was able to kind of see the new system in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6963.925s">And</a>  so I can positively report that there is a noted shift, a noted difference at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6972.933s">The</a>  hallways are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6975.174s">The</a>  hallways are quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6976.395s">The</a>  bathrooms are orderly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6978.256s">We're</a>  not having overcrowding in the bathrooms at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6982.319s">It's</a>  two students at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6985.001s">And</a>  the feedback has been fairly, fairly positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6991.125s">One</a>  additional shift that I didn't talk about was students who were cutting class. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6997.683s">One</a>  new thing that we did institute working with the teachers is if a student were to cut a class or not be present the teachers have been using one of our. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7009.648s">special</a>  platforms called talking points, and they just send a little message to the parents to let them know that a student may not have been in the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7020.594s">And</a>  for that reason, they're notifying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7024.157s">So</a>  these are just some of the slight shifts that have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7028.399s">But</a>  I can positively report that it has made a drastic difference just in this short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7036.941s">And</a>  I look forward to seeing continued shifts and improvement as we go forward.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7045.443s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7047.524s">Questions</a>  from the committee?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7050.925s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7053.204s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7053.664s">I</a>  have just a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7056.566s">So</a>  I'm particularly interested in item number two and item number three and item number four on the action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7065.793s">And</a>  it sounds like there's been an immediate response to put some structures in place to address these topics, which I think is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7079.16s">But</a>  I think my question is, or I guess my question is, who is doing those things? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7083.942s">And</a>  is it sustainable for them to continue to do those things into the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7087.724s">And</a>  if it's not, what is our plan that those actions actually can be sustainable? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7095.747s">And</a>  I just, I'm really sensitive to and appreciative of all the people who have put all their hands on deck to address some of these issues that have gone on for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7106.592s">But</a>  I also am, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7107.938s">very</a>  aware of the work they're supposed to be doing in there every single day, which probably doesn't include some of the things we're asking them to do right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7116.101s">And</a>  I'm concerned about that sustainability going forward and what the plan is to make sure that that can continue without being massively disruptive to everything else that has to happen in the district.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7130.768s">So</a>  one of the things that we did when we asked for support and help for all hands on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7139.17s">When</a>  we asked for the teachers to provide additional support we did include compensation because some of the teachers, it could have been a prep period. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7149.673s">So</a>  where they would have been preparing during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7152.734s">They</a>  have volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7154.796s">They've</a>  given up that particular period of prep, and they said okay I will be part of monitoring the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7164.203s">So</a>  that was something which. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7168.186s">bathroom</a>  monitoring in the hallway monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7172.871s">That</a>  was something that we weren't really doing to that level we had teacher support during lunches, there were teachers who were providing additional lunch support and that's something that happened <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7186.764s">in</a>  the past, but asking for specific support with naming the different areas of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7197.009s">So</a>  it is something that we're, you know, when the incident initially took place, we really, it was everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7205.293s">There</a>  were a lot of, almost more adults in the hallway than there were students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7210.816s">As</a>  we are getting back into the routine, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7214.498s">of</a>  going to class once the bell rings and passing period has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7220.179s">It</a>  hasn't been necessary to keep as large a number because we do have our building monitors that are already in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7230.501s">We</a>  have two SROs that are just walking and just making sure that things are peaceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7235.843s">So</a>  we do have staff, we have five building monitors right now, and we are still looking to increase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7243.244s">So</a>  at any given time, and we have seven administrators at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7248.247s">So</a>  when you add all of those school-based administrators, and that's not talking about our other administrators that are central office-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7257.892s">So</a>  from a sustainability perspective, I don't think we're going to need to have a large number of people <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7269.238s">You</a>  know, all hands on deck I think it's cool we're going to be able to get to a manageable number of staff, supporting the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7276.484s">So,</a>  you know, that that's what I would say so from a sustainability, we may end up saying we might need, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7285.832s">one</a>  or two other teachers or someone to help like in the lunches we did add an additional person, and the teachers have graciously, you know, signed up, and, you know, I've, we've been very appreciative of the support, and just looking at what we can do with the staff that we have, and having a reasonable number of additional staff at different points throughout the building.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7314.616s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7315.356s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that it's clear that if you need support from a funding perspective, please tell us what those things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7327.439s">And</a>  I know we're going to come up on budget season really fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7330.739s">And</a>  we can certainly talk about this again as part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7336.601s">But</a>  we want to hear from you if there is support or infrastructure that's lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7343.547s">The</a>  idea that this is sustainable through brute force is fraught for lots of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7350.488s">And</a>  I want to make sure that if there are things that we need to do so that we can have a little bit more of an efficient way to do these things, that we are pursuing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7360.57s">And</a>  if that means investments, I think we're all here to support that and tell the community why it's necessary.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7370.48s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7371.9s">I</a>  fully am on board with that as we are continuing to just look at how the high school is, how it's functioning, what's working, what isn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7380.542s">And</a>  we're continuing to meet today, all of central office and all of the administrative team, including Janet Connors, who's with the building monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7393.384s">We</a>  sat down and we are meeting, we are talking, we are giving feedback to one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7399.685s">and</a>  just saying okay what else can we do to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7404.186s">Mr.</a>  Michael Welch was there as well as you know, a listener and observer and just, if so it's it's a group effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7411.988s">And</a>  really, Michelle man was there, looking at what we're doing and how we can continue to improve and tweak. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7420.99s">So</a>  it is a work in progress but we are not going to shy away from asking for additional resources in key areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7428.956s">during</a>  the budget season.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7431.057s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7431.577s">And</a>  the other request that I have, this school committee is supposed to review and sign off on handbooks on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7439.742s">And</a>  I've never done that since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7442.944s">And</a>  I am pretty certain that we've talked about it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7446.746s">So</a>  I'd like to ask for you to put forward a schedule to us of how you will present those handbooks to us for our review for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7457.571s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7459.028s">And</a>  it would be really great if there was some tracking mechanism when you share those documents with us so we can understand like what does it look like today and what are you proposing the changes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7469.473s">And</a>  you know I think these like we just need to make sure that there's enough time for us to do a good diligent job of that because it's not been done as long as we've been on the committee, so I think that's it's really important that we get into a better. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7486.252s">and</a>  more consistent annual process to do that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7488.374s">Schedule.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7488.894s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7489.174s">Prior</a>  to the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7490.755s">We'll</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7491.096s">We'll</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7491.516s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7492.837s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, then Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7495.159s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7496.119s">Thank</a>  you for this, for the action plan and for the work that's been done, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7501.303s">And</a>  I particularly like the, you know, the graphic and the way that it's laid out very clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7505.326s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7507.008s">I'm</a>  curious about the anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7509.349s">If</a>  you could share a little bit more about that, what the infrastructure of that is actually going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7514.393s">Is</a>  this a, is this a, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7516.81s">technology</a>  that we have that we're going to be able to use? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7519.433s">Or</a>  is it, you know, traditional paper system? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7523.518s">Like,</a>  what is that actually going to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7525.1s">And</a>  where's that data going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7526.482s">And</a>  how will we be kept informed of it?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7531.468s">So</a>  when I went through the training, it's an online platform that is affiliated with the Sandy Hook, see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7542.751s">And</a>  they had us as administrators, after we got trained, they had us do like a mock training where you had to like log in and each person would report in. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7555.815s">You'd</a>  have like a specialized <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7558.876s">identification</a>  for for administrators, and then it goes to like a reporting system where the information is taken in, and you can follow up with it without knowing <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7573.984s">So</a>  we're aware that some information will be timely, some information might be this happened, or the information may be a little more vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7583.711s">So</a>  there is kind of like another layer, I should say, where there's analysis that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7592.197s">So</a>  the students, when they get trained, they will download the app onto their telephones. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7598.561s">So</a>  it is not... <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7601.743s">It's</a>  not something that you're writing like paper longhand, it's like a digital, it's essentially an app. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7610.07s">And</a>  when you put the information in the app, it gets logged and then it gets sent to the key individuals who would need to be alerted that something was added to the platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7625.223s">And</a>  depending on the level of seriousness, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7631.627s">It</a>  will go to like a 911 level or something like that and I don't know if anyone Dr crushing if you want to jump in.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7640.232s">Sandy</a>  hook line.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7647.597s">So</a>  first I want to give full credit to Stacey showman and our counseling staff for reaching out seeking out this application so this is a free application through Sandy have promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7656.823s">And</a>  what it does is it essentially filters the incidents as they come in, and those of highest concern will be sent through police dispatch, whereas others will be sent to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7672.546s">So</a>  if somebody is reporting, you know, let your mind run wild, something very concerning, something very high needs, and that'll trigger an immediate call to the police, as well as a notification of the school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7685.499s">if</a>  it's something a little bit lower of, you know, bullying or something along those lines, it'll trigger a school response as opposed to a police response. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7692.425s">So,</a>  it's varied and the training is quite extensive and there's a high bar that San Diego Promise requires school districts to meet in order to attain and utilize this program.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7706.337s">And</a>  I think if I may just point out, this is just one avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7710.62s">If</a>  you went to the <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7713.982s">meetings,</a>  they were by grade level on the first day back last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7718.643s">Each</a>  grade level was able to see a picture and the name associated with anybody in the building that could be a trusted adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7726.244s">And</a>  it came to news for me that there is plenty of people that our children, teens can report to, whether that be anonymously or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7737.626s">And</a>  so 12 total mental health professionals in the building <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7742.563s">six</a>  guidance Councilors, principal, three assistants, and the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7746.866s">And</a>  the students were shown every name and picture so that they have an idea of where they are in the building, who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7753.509s">And</a>  I think one important thing that has changed in the last two weeks is it was going to be a form survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7759.013s">And</a>  between Peter and Joan, I know you're working on it a great deal, the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7763.515s">I'm</a>  pushing very hard behind the scenes that it not be a form survey, that we have a survey <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7768.727s">that</a>  we develop, take our time, an extra couple of weeks to develop that is gonna fit the needs of our students and our teachers and our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7776.773s">Then</a>  some of the questions are gonna be based off of what we've learned in the listening sessions, in the class meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7784.258s">And</a>  for an example, it's, do you have a trusted adult in the building that you can go to voice a concern to? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7789.702s">And</a>  if not, do you want one so that you can connect students directly? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7794.446s">And</a>  that's just one example. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7796.854s">The</a>  administration is trying to do this right and be thoughtful, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7800.776s">I'm</a>  pushing for it, and I'm getting good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7804.218s">So</a>  I just wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7805.839s">There</a>  are trusted people in the building, plenty of them that our students can go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7810.302s">This</a>  is another means of, I want to be completely anonymous. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7813.724s">I'm</a>  going to report to this line.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7815.745s">Madam</a>  Mayor, if I can, to that end, we are also, as many of you know, are right now doing a health curriculum review. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7821.569s">We</a>  have an extraordinarily talented group of people who have stepped up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7826.423s">And</a>  on this past Wednesday at a meeting, I put the charge to them to think of school safety questions that they might consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7834.006s">So</a>  they're also researching. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7835.627s">The</a>  team at Panorama is not only using their research team to help us build questions, but they've reached out to their partners throughout other school districts who have faced these challenges to also see what questions we can bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7848.432s">So</a>  those are three specific avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7851.823s">you</a>  know, us in the buildings, our HECAT team and Panorama with two avenues internally there, the research team, as well as reaching out to other school districts.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7863.113s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7864.694s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7865.014s">Just</a>  to follow up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7865.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7866.135s">That</a>  was very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7867.256s">So</a>  I'm just wondering, I'm sure that obviously because it's online, there'll be data collection specific to this anonymous line. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7875.063s">So</a>  there'll be data collection. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7876.124s">So</a>  there'll be an ability to report how many calls came in or how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7880.646s">Anonymous</a>  reports were made, you know, sort of what sort of, you know, context, they were in generally that sort of thing, which department will be handling the response to that is not going to be stationed showman's department or is it, it'll be a collaboration between the counseling and school leadership.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7897.099s">So,</a>  and this is that this is going to be at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7900.181s">Yeah,</a>  and an opportunity at each school for students to access this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7903.703s">And</a>  so, you know, we need to make sure that not only that not everything that not every burden falls on our counseling staff that it also is supported by our school leaders as well.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7917.691s">Mayor,</a>  just one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7919.452s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7919.932s">And</a>  if we could think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7922.306s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7922.486s">Bone,</a>  if we could think about some either PECS images or social stories or something like that, that will support students who don't communicate with words or otherwise that are able to access this line as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7936.609s">Most</a>  students with IEPs have bullying plans in their IEP anyway, but if there could be some support around this line existing, that would be really helpful for those classrooms.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7948.011s">Good</a>  suggestion.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7949.172s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7950.152s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7951.027s">Member</a>  Hays, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7953.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7954.528s">I</a>  just had a few, few questions, some of them might be very quick, hopefully.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7958.308s">Do</a>  we have a date for the survey yet I, I feel like maybe that was already answered because you said you're taking a little extra time to try to buy the end of January, we would like to administer that Dr. Cushing is working with panorama, and the end of January first week or so of February, we really do.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7977.128s">There</a>  will be some questions that come directly from panorama that nationally norm nationally metric, but then when we launch our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7984.475s">We</a>  want to make sure that they're collecting the really important data and we're not so worried much about survey metrics in this realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=7992.021s">As</a>  you know, but we want to make sure we're collecting really good viable data that's going to help inform our practice moving forward to make the changes students and families expect</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8001.636s">And</a>  then have we put any thought into, and maybe this goes towards resources and what the school committee can do for you, giving this survey on a yearly basis, even twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8014.06s">I</a>  looked it up and there's some school systems in the area who seem to be giving this kind of a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8018.141s">In</a>  fact, I think it was the Panorama company or platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8023.463s">Just</a>  something to think about in the future, just to keep getting this information from students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8029.265s">The</a>  world is ever-changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8031.232s">our</a>  needs are going to change and it would be nice to have this information on a, maybe an annual, maybe even by, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8038.155s">I</a>  don't know what the costs of it are and what the feasibility would be, but just something to think about because I think, you know, we know that getting the student information was huge for us with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8049.341s">This</a>  was really, um, eyeopening to a lot of people, um, what we needed and what, what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8055.964s">Um,</a>  so the more often you can get that kind of information, I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8060.717s">the</a>  better, which also leads to my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8064.422s">I</a>  was wondering about the listening sessions and kind of how is data being collected from those listening sessions? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8072.392s">Because</a>  it would be good to know, obviously, to figure out are there certain groups of students who are feeling <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8078.76s">more</a>  uncomfortable than others or certain concerns that crop up for, you know, males versus females, maybe our LGBTQ population, maybe our students of color, are we actually collecting the information in a way that we could look at it in that depth?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8097.026s">So,</a>  the listening sessions that I attended there, they were made up of like a diverse group of students so we had English learners we do want to, for those that have limited English, we do want to get some translated sessions for them to make sure that they're understanding all of what's being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8118.106s">But</a>  we did have smaller group sessions, and we are going to continue to get feedback from the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8125.032s">And</a>  the things that the students said, some of them were quite comical. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8130.376s">They</a>  had interesting perspectives on the new rules that are coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8136.821s">They're</a>  aware of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8138.943s">But</a>  after they said those pieces, honestly, <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8144.548s">majority</a>  of students that I've spoken with and have asked them, you know, how do you feel? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8149.272s">They</a>  all have talked about definitely feeling safer and feeling like the bathrooms, which used to be an area of, you know, large congregating, large groups of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8161.943s">Now</a>  that there are only two students, they feel like that's kind of like a stress-free experience for them.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8169.642s">I</a>  just was wondering, as you're doing those listening sessions, someone writing down.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8174.084s">Yes,</a>  it is being recorded, it is being recorded notes are being taken on the guidance Councilors, Michelle men, the different Councilors who have been present for those as well they have been taking notes and just capturing like the key ideas key themes, some of the students keep, you know, they may be repeating, you know, the same thing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8198.096s">If</a>  that happens, they're not gonna record it over and over again, but it's just noted that this is something that they would like us to definitely pay attention to.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8206.423s">And</a>  one last request I had, or maybe you're already doing this, for the counseling services and making sure that, or the support services, those phone numbers you gave us, are those being posted on the school website so people have a central place they could go to find those? <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8222.831s">rather</a>  than, you know, trying to remember from the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8226.453s">I</a>  should make sure I'm not sure if the slide deck if we had posted that but I can definitely get the informational slide deck or make minor tweaks to it so that parents can also know who's serving in what capacity.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8241.521s">And</a>  those numbers in the community I was thinking of specifically because those are newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8246.701s">And</a>  the care solace, just if there's a- Oh, those phone numbers.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8249.602s">Yes,</a>  yes, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8250.262s">I</a>  can definitely get that in a different format. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8253.563s">So</a>  people will know these are additional resources that are available for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=8257.825s">Yes.</a> </p>
