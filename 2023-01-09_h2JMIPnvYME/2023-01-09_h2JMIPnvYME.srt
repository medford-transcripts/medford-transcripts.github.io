[SPEAKER_11]: Still a member or so online.

01:18:09,743 --> 01:18:10,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here.

10
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:20,393
[SPEAKER_11]: We just checked the echo while we're waiting for the superintendent, just because I was echoing.

11
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:21,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

12
01:18:22,055 --> 01:18:22,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

13
01:18:51,512 --> 01:18:52,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to wait for the superintendent.

14
01:18:52,773 --> 01:18:54,355
[SPEAKER_07]: She's one of the first agenda items.

15
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:58,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to welcome our student representatives, Dominic Bruno and Lauren Serra.

16
01:18:59,339 --> 01:18:59,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming.

17
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:03,862
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to speak, just like member Graham or member Krets know, they'll

18
01:19:04,246 --> 01:19:05,166
[SPEAKER_07]: lend you their microphone.

19
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:12,169
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our consent agenda number five, bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes from December 19, 2022.

20
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:16,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve the minutes?

21
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:21,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by member Graham.

22
01:19:21,934 --> 01:19:22,674

[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

28

[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

29
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: With somebody online, do we need to roll call everything, all the votes?

30
01:19:34,932 --> 01:19:35,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We can.

31
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:35,672
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

32
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:38,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to make sure we were following.

33
01:19:38,913 --> 01:19:41,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, if you want to roll call the consent agenda, please.

34
01:19:43,434 --> 01:19:43,714

36
01:19:46,174 --> 01:19:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:19:49,195 --> 01:19:49,435

01:19:52,716 --> 01:19:52,916
Yes.

41
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:54,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

42
01:19:55,897 --> 01:19:56,177

49
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:21,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor.

50
01:20:22,423 --> 01:20:23,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau.

51
01:20:25,444 --> 01:20:27,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I don't have them in front of me, my apologies.

52
01:20:28,286 --> 01:20:29,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't summarize them.

53
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:31,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So can I motion to table them again?

54
01:20:31,528 --> 01:20:32,088
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:42,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:20:51,673 --> 01:20:52,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the affirmative, some of the negative.

71
01:20:56,116 --> 01:21:01,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The report of subcommittee rules and policy subcommittee minutes have been tabled.

72
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Number seven, we have reports of the superintendent.

73
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: The first up is superintendent's updates and comments.

74
01:21:07,884 --> 01:21:08,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Brice Edward-Vinson.

75
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:18,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

76
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:21,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

77
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:29,032
[SPEAKER_16]: It is my hope that everyone had the opportunity to spend quality time with their family and friends over the holiday break.

78
01:21:31,107 --> 01:21:45,882
[SPEAKER_16]: We at the Medford Public Schools have been diligently working to bring forth a plan for a new year that provides a renewed sense of safety and a means to highlight the many accomplishments and opportunities provided at Medford High School.

79
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:52,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Often a tragic situation takes the focus away on what is good.

80
01:21:53,877 --> 01:22:03,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel compelled to state that the Medford Public Schools, in particular Medford High School, has a tremendous amount of good going on daily.

81
01:22:06,341 --> 01:22:16,464
[SPEAKER_16]: As I had stated prior to school break, so many of our students were actively involved in helping others to have a nice holiday season.

82
01:22:18,203 --> 01:22:29,730
[SPEAKER_16]: The Friday before the holiday break, students at Medford High School were decorating gingerbread cookies, playing holiday carol music with their guitars.

83
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:37,775
[SPEAKER_16]: The senior class of 2023 enjoyed their senior breakfast, complete with their pajamas on.

84
01:22:39,396 --> 01:22:45,220
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a bagpiper strolling in the hallways at the end of the day to bid farewell to one of our teachers.

85
01:22:46,124 --> 01:22:49,006
[SPEAKER_16]: and there were plenty of blow-up characters in the hallways.

86
01:22:51,127 --> 01:22:59,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing all of these things, it definitely made my heart sing that our high school students were able to leave for vacation on a positive note.

87
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:13,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Our teachers, working with central administration, wanted all of the students to leave for the holiday break with a positive experience, and they truly went above and beyond to make that happen.

88
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,121
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank them all.

89
01:23:17,096 --> 01:23:23,639
[SPEAKER_16]: While it doesn't wash away what has happened, it does allow me to focus on a quote by author Melanie Beatty.

90
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:30,742
[SPEAKER_16]: The new year stands before us like a chapter in a book waiting to be written.

91
01:23:32,043 --> 01:23:36,085
[SPEAKER_16]: As a community, we must come together in order to write that new chapter.

92
01:23:38,092 --> 01:23:52,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that the mayor, the school committee, central administration, our counseling and behavioral health office staff, along with teachers, administrators, and the Medford Police Department had not stopped over the holiday break.

93
01:23:53,923 --> 01:24:00,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Our school community can only achieve peace and greatness if we do so collaboratively.

94
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:11,008
[SPEAKER_16]: As I announced last Thursday, we produced our 10 point action plan for safety, transparency and accountability at the high school.

95
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:15,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I plan to discuss that plan more in depth later this evening.

96
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:27,484
[SPEAKER_16]: However, let me state once again, that our top priority has always been to provide a safe and secure learning environment for all our students and staff.

97
01:24:28,743 --> 01:24:36,329
[SPEAKER_16]: As Mustangs, we know a positive school culture is paramount to providing quality and supportive education.

98
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:46,116
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our time to move forward together with attitudes and knowledge to help our students reach their academic and personal potentials.

99
01:24:47,336 --> 01:24:51,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Our students, staff, and families require nothing less.

100
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:57,744
[SPEAKER_16]: On that, I would like to share an important information note.

101
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:09,042
[SPEAKER_16]: that the Massachusetts Behavioral Health, the helpline is now available, it's live.

102
01:25:09,622 --> 01:25:12,846
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna thank member McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention.

103
01:25:14,467 --> 01:25:18,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether there is a crisis or you are unsure where to turn,

104
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:25,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Now there is a number that you are able to call or text, and that number is 833-773-2445.

105
01:25:25,072 --> 01:25:26,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, that number is 833-773-2445.

106
01:25:37,484 --> 01:25:37,504
[SPEAKER_16]: 773-2445.

107
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:53,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, please note that there are 25 designated community behavioral health centers across the state, which can be accessed regardless of your insurance.

108
01:25:55,021 --> 01:26:00,386
[SPEAKER_16]: These centers can be utilized for all behavioral health evaluation and treatment.

109
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:11,362
[SPEAKER_16]: The center that will assist Medford residents is located at Cambridge Health Alliance, 1493 Cambridge Street.

110
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:12,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And their number is 833-222-2030.

111
01:26:19,921 --> 01:26:22,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the number is 833-222-2030.

112
01:26:24,883 --> 01:26:37,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And if people want to look and do research for additional information, you can go to mass.gov slash community behavioral health centers.

113
01:26:41,048 --> 01:26:49,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to transition and just share a few key updates of things that will be going on in the district this coming week and next week.

114
01:26:53,427 --> 01:27:07,115
[SPEAKER_16]: This week on January 11th, our rec department will be inviting all students with the half day to skate at La Conte Ice Skating Rink for free until two o'clock in the afternoon.

115
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Skates are available to rent for $5.

116
01:27:09,896 --> 01:27:18,121
[SPEAKER_16]: So if families are looking for something to do with their students, that is available and we thank the Medford rec department for that.

117
01:27:19,173 --> 01:27:30,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, on January 11 CPAC will be hosting their monthly meeting featuring Tom Santacondro on making transition documents easy.

118
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:32,183
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a Zoom meeting.

01:27:32,343 --> 01:27:33,124
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from 6 to 8 p.m.

[SPEAKER_16]: at Tufts University on January 15.

123
01:27:57,568 --> 01:28:07,280
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the fifth annual Tufts Classic Cup for both Somerville and Medford High School basketball teams.

124
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:09,703
[SPEAKER_16]: It's taking place at Cousins Gym.

125
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:15,638
[SPEAKER_16]: The boys will play at noon, and the girls will follow at 1.30pm.

126
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:31,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Admission is free, and Tufts is requesting if you are able to donate a non-perishable food item, which will be donated to the Mystic Community Market in Medford and Project Soup in Somerville.

127
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:40,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, donations can be canned food, household cleaning items, feminine hygiene products, baby diapers, and toiletries.

01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:17,831
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the year of the rabbit and the rabbit embodies the yin or the passive principle of the universe, which means the new year will bring with it the hope that people will be able to lead a more relaxed and balanced life.

148
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:21,053
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to wish our Asian families

149
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:26,736
[SPEAKER_16]: who celebrate Lunar New Year, a happy and healthy Lunar New Year.

150
01:31:27,017 --> 01:31:27,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

151
01:31:29,078 --> 01:31:30,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

152
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:37,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have number two report on world language update, Dr. Vilma Bebo.

153
01:31:37,602 --> 01:31:37,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Bebo.

154
01:31:38,302 --> 01:31:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Bebo, sorry.

155
01:31:39,403 --> 01:31:40,483
[SPEAKER_07]: World language coordinator.

156
01:31:40,984 --> 01:31:41,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

157
01:31:41,384 --> 01:31:41,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

158
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:45,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

159
01:31:51,192 --> 01:31:51,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Next slide, please.

160
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:52,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Next.

161
01:31:54,596 --> 01:31:59,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the opportunity to offer you a mid-year update on the world language program and department.

162
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:10,673
[SPEAKER_14]: The program of study, a series of courses and other educational program offered at Medford High School and Vocational Technical High School will include a new world language course description.

163
01:32:14,056 --> 01:32:27,055
[SPEAKER_14]: The new description will reflect the actual national standards and is divided in three major communicators levels novice grades six eight intermediate grades 1012 and advanced AP courses.

164
01:32:31,857 --> 01:32:36,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Before the course description, there will be four paragraphs to introduce the World Language Program at Medford.

165
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:54,476
[SPEAKER_14]: The first paragraph is the department mission statement, which states that the Medford Language Program at the Medford Public Schools provides students with the necessary tools to become global citizens and learners committed to understanding and appreciating their own culture, as well as the culture of others.

166
01:32:55,197 --> 01:33:06,487
[SPEAKER_14]: The program strives to empower students by broadening their perspectives, applying their language and presentational skills to real life situations, and nurturing empathy for others.

167
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:15,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Furthermore, the program is committed to inspiring all students to find joy in language learning and applying their knowledge to other disciplines.

168
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:25,315
[SPEAKER_14]: As a result, students will develop the skills to be successful in today's job market and feel fully competent and well adjusted in today's diverse world.

169
01:33:28,017 --> 01:33:42,784
[SPEAKER_14]: The second paragraph describes the world language program at Medford and states that world language courses in Medford public schools follow the proficiency model of language instruction reflected in Massachusetts State curriculum frameworks and the national standards for education.

170
01:33:43,812 --> 01:33:53,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Students are presented with grammar and vocabulary in context and are encouraged to express themselves in the target language independently of a text as soon as possible.

171
01:33:54,736 --> 01:34:00,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Awareness of cultural differences and similarities is essential to complete language education.

172
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:07,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Interdisciplinary teams allow students to use the language they acquire to learn about their world in general.

173
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:13,003
[SPEAKER_14]: They also demonstrate a more authentic use of the language to communicate important

174
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:14,130
[SPEAKER_14]: information.

175
01:34:16,132 --> 01:34:27,438
[SPEAKER_14]: The third paragraph describes the world language program at Medford and states that a minimum of two-year iSchool world language courses sequence is recommended for students seeking admission to competitive colleges.

176
01:34:28,359 --> 01:34:35,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Our curriculum does not focus on standardized tests other than the advanced placements exams and the sealable literacy exam.

177
01:34:36,021 --> 01:34:45,189
[SPEAKER_14]: However, students who are completed the Spanish, French, or Italian intermediate honors have been introduced to their full continuum of grammatical concepts in ample vocabulary.

178
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:51,694
[SPEAKER_14]: In most cases, this prepares students with the skills necessary for success on the SAT subject tests.

179
01:34:52,535 --> 01:34:55,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Colleges express no preference among languages.

180
01:34:57,571 --> 01:35:05,158
[SPEAKER_14]: The fourth paragraph describes the sealable literacy, but for high school students may be eligible to receive the sealable literacy upon graduation.

181
01:35:05,778 --> 01:35:19,671
[SPEAKER_14]: The sealable literacy is an award given by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in recognition of students who have studied and attained a designated level of proficiency in two or more languages, including English by high school graduation.

182
01:35:20,404 --> 01:35:36,632
[SPEAKER_14]: The criteria are a rating of intermediate I or above evaluated via testing, the measures on language skills, reading, writing, listening and speaking, and a score of proficient or above on the high school ELA and CAS.

183
01:35:37,637 --> 01:35:52,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Students fluent in a language not taken at school also qualify to test for the seal of literacy we encourage students to continue their study of language to our high school as multiple years of study will provide the opportunity to this award.

184
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:59,924
[SPEAKER_14]: After the fourth paragraph, there is a sentence that introduces the various levels of proficiency.

185
01:36:00,504 --> 01:36:07,531
[SPEAKER_14]: The sentence reads, the following is a description of a communicator in the target language when enrolled in a particular course.

186
01:36:08,212 --> 01:36:12,116
[SPEAKER_14]: This is aligned with the American Council for the Teaching of World Language Act.

187
01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:18,122
[SPEAKER_14]: This visual on your left represents the path to second language proficiency.

188
01:36:19,684 --> 01:36:31,616
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see the path starts from novice low to novice mid, novice high, intermediate low, intermediate mid, intermediate high, up to advanced low.

189
01:36:33,478 --> 01:36:40,725
[SPEAKER_14]: In the box, this is an example of a description of the novice low communicator or what students can do at this level.

190
01:36:43,177 --> 01:36:46,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, there is an example of intermediate low.

191
01:36:47,239 --> 01:36:51,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, what students can do at this level with this communicator.

192
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, we have an example of advanced low communicator, or what students can do at this level.

193
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:09,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Please note that the program of study will reflect all level of proficiency, seven total, novice low, mid, and high, intermediate low, mid, and high, and advanced low.

194
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:17,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So all stakeholders can refer to them, and we allow more clarification on what students can do with the language in each level.

195
01:37:20,258 --> 01:37:31,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Next, we have an example of a course description which clarifies what students should be able to do at the end of Spanish, for example, Spanish, French, and Italian 2CP.

196
01:37:32,027 --> 01:37:37,572
[SPEAKER_14]: The target level is Novice I, and the prerequisite to take this course is Novice Med.

197
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:45,882
[SPEAKER_14]: By the end of this course, the students will be one step closer to the intermediate level, which is in the middle of the path to proficiency in high school.

198
01:37:47,102 --> 01:37:56,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have an example of another course description, which clarifies what students should be able to do at the end of Spanish or French in Italian to honors.

199
01:37:56,806 --> 01:38:03,008
[SPEAKER_14]: The target level is intermediate to low, and the prerequisite to take this course is novice high.

200
01:38:03,809 --> 01:38:09,132
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end of this course, students will be one step closer to the intermediate level.

201
01:38:12,854 --> 01:38:15,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Next is an update on the online program.

202
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:19,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I met with each online educator to discuss the online courses.

203
01:38:20,863 --> 01:38:25,165
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the updates as of December 22nd, 2022, sorry.

204
01:38:26,086 --> 01:38:36,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Online courses are using Google Classroom, which provides weekly posting, alignments, reminders, additional material, and communication to both students and parents and caregivers.

205
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:39,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Next.

206
01:38:40,174 --> 01:38:44,217
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some additional material platforms the educator are using with their online courses.

207
01:38:45,287 --> 01:38:52,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Note how this additional support aims to develop and support all four essential skills to become proficient in a word language.

208
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:58,772
[SPEAKER_14]: All of these additional supports, they support either reading, writing, listening, and speaking, or all of the above.

209
01:39:01,973 --> 01:39:05,715
[SPEAKER_14]: The assessment and grading are not aligned among the online courses.

210
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:11,077
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my goal to align the online curriculum with the in-person to reflect the national standards.

211
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:16,465
[SPEAKER_14]: The department is currently working on curriculum alignment with the new Massachusetts framework.

212
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:21,587
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the online educators' feedback.

213
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:25,088
[SPEAKER_14]: FluentU is a platform to support the online courses.

214
01:39:25,248 --> 01:39:28,789
[SPEAKER_14]: However, most educators find it limited in material access.

215
01:39:29,710 --> 01:39:36,452
[SPEAKER_14]: All educators want to have a meeting time with students and mandate once a week meeting so they can catch up, ask questions, and get help.

216
01:39:37,682 --> 01:39:47,806
[SPEAKER_14]: If students are provided with the time built into their schedule to meet with their teacher once a week, perhaps they could use that time to catch up on some work as well.

217
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:54,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Parents appear to be satisfied with the online program and appreciate all the information they can get from the educators.

218
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:58,763
[SPEAKER_14]: The next step is to have a survey from online students and parents.

219
01:39:59,283 --> 01:40:24,797
[SPEAKER_14]: How they feel about the online courses, how satisfied they are with the type of technology and software they are using, how they are learning the skills and knowledge necessary for success in language, how much time they spend in the online courses on a weekly basis, what is the primary reason to opt to be enrolled in the online course, and if there is anything else that they would like to tell us.

220
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:36,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, I would like to share that I teach an adult Italian class starting this Thursday once a week in the evening at MHS.

221
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not compensated for it.

222
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:45,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead, this group will donate a scholarship for seniors in the World Language Program.

223
01:40:47,062 --> 01:40:48,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for your time.

224
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:49,603
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

225
01:40:49,923 --> 01:40:50,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Ms.

226
01:40:50,943 --> 01:40:51,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabot.

227
01:40:51,404 --> 01:40:52,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions from the committee?

228
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:55,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

229
01:40:55,601 --> 01:40:56,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

230
01:40:56,421 --> 01:40:57,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you have a question member miss stone.

231
01:40:58,864 --> 01:41:00,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for all that information.

232
01:41:00,966 --> 01:41:14,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any conversation about adding another language to the world language department I know in the past people had emailed, both for Chinese Arabic, or even sign language and I didn't know if that was a conversation to expand the languages we offer.

233
01:41:15,523 --> 01:41:18,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, of course, we're always open to have those wonderful conversation.

234
01:41:19,004 --> 01:41:26,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I already had a little teeny tiny conversation with my supervisor, and I'm open to have more in-depth conversation.

235
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:31,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to survey the district as well, see how parents and students feel about that.

236
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:32,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

237
01:41:33,106 --> 01:41:34,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, thank you.

238
01:41:34,306 --> 01:41:34,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

239
01:41:34,726 --> 01:41:35,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

240
01:41:37,527 --> 01:41:41,768
[SPEAKER_07]: We have number three, report on updated Medford High School's safety plan.

241
01:41:42,288 --> 01:41:43,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

242
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening again.

243
01:41:49,561 --> 01:42:02,931
[SPEAKER_16]: So this evening, I wanted to share with the committee the key steps that we have taken at Medford High School.

244
01:42:03,812 --> 01:42:14,621
[SPEAKER_16]: The first piece being, this is a black and white version, but this is an updated student guide to the school safety

245
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:18,475
[SPEAKER_16]: procedures that we have at Medford High School.

246
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:30,062
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, many of the in light of what ended up transpiring we realized that there were a lot of things that we could do in the immediate

247
01:42:31,127 --> 01:42:43,549
[SPEAKER_16]: to ensure that the school would get right back on track and instill a greater sense of security and safety for all, which is what our primary goal was.

248
01:42:44,589 --> 01:42:59,592
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to start with the 10 point action plan, which highlights some of the key initiatives that we did as a district from December through where we are right now with the start of the school year.

249
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:11,433
[SPEAKER_16]: The first step, and this was in collaboration with the Medford Police Department and working closely with Chief Buckley.

250
01:43:12,498 --> 01:43:20,961
[SPEAKER_16]: We were able to add have an additional school resource officer assigned to the high school.

251
01:43:21,381 --> 01:43:31,103
[SPEAKER_16]: So we now have two full time school resource officers based at Medford High School, providing support and

252
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:47,581
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, again, right now we have one male and one female school resource officer and Chief Buckley does have a few other officers that have been changed, but at any given point in time we will have two officers.

253
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:50,142
[SPEAKER_16]: So, a few others have been trained and we may.

254
01:43:51,602 --> 01:44:00,285
[SPEAKER_16]: rotate some of them as time goes on, but we will always have to school resource or school resource officers assigned to the building.

255
01:44:00,845 --> 01:44:08,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I was very pleased we were able to work on that over the break, and with our return to school on January 3.

256
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:12,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Since then, we have had two assigned and Ms.

257
01:44:13,629 --> 01:44:25,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Julia Pottier is our second school resource officer and Mr. Conway has been our school resource officer as well this year.

258
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:36,376
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the second areas where we made significant changes were related to the bathroom occupancy.

259
01:44:37,464 --> 01:44:39,585
[SPEAKER_16]: At the time of the incident that took place.

260
01:44:40,725 --> 01:44:45,907
[SPEAKER_16]: There was definitely an incredibly large number of students that were in the restroom.

261
01:44:46,428 --> 01:44:54,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I still ask myself how did they fit in there, but there were a significant amount of students that were in the restroom.

262
01:44:55,271 --> 01:44:58,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the things that we did immediately was to

263
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:10,636
[SPEAKER_16]: look at the structure of the high school, identify the most frequently used restrooms that are there, and to have bathroom monitors.

264
01:45:11,796 --> 01:45:22,740
[SPEAKER_16]: There is signage on the bathrooms right now that say occupancy, no more than two students at a time allowed in the restrooms.

265
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:27,501
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been administrators, teachers,

266
01:45:30,262 --> 01:45:34,665
[SPEAKER_16]: building monitors the rotation, everyone all hands on deck.

267
01:45:35,285 --> 01:45:47,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, when we're doing the bathroom duty or monitoring the students are also self monitoring as they're coming in and coming out, you know students have said oh two people are already inside.

268
01:45:48,394 --> 01:45:49,275
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll wait my turn.

269
01:45:50,015 --> 01:46:02,802
[SPEAKER_16]: and they wait patiently and that bathroom occupancy putting a limit has really helped to make sure that people just use the facility go in and go out.

270
01:46:03,483 --> 01:46:07,665
[SPEAKER_16]: And that has made truly a significant difference since we've been back.

271
01:46:10,107 --> 01:46:16,030
[SPEAKER_16]: A third shift that has happened is in regards to identification.

272
01:46:18,453 --> 01:46:23,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we are going to be having all of our students wear their school based IDs.

273
01:46:24,115 --> 01:46:29,157
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that some identification or school IDs may have been lost.

274
01:46:29,637 --> 01:46:36,440
[SPEAKER_16]: So new IDs were ordered for all students again, and they should be coming in shortly.

275
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:42,923
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're waiting for the additional lanyards that will be coming in as well.

276
01:46:45,722 --> 01:46:56,751
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is something I happen to have my ID on me, but all the students will be wearing their ID and they will have breakaway lanyards.

277
01:46:57,571 --> 01:47:00,974
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's something that was important for us to be able to do.

278
01:47:02,755 --> 01:47:05,838
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of supervision in the hallways,

279
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:33,079
[SPEAKER_16]: In the cafeterias, and in the bathrooms, we do have increased presence increased duty schedules, where we look in staff and administration have filled in those blocks to continue to supervise and monitor what's happening in the hallways what's happening at check in.

280
01:47:34,116 --> 01:47:36,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Students, when they come to school if they are tardy.

281
01:47:37,761 --> 01:47:40,244
[SPEAKER_16]: They now report to the main office.

282
01:47:40,965 --> 01:47:48,635
[SPEAKER_16]: So when they come in, they go up the front stairwell, and they go into the main office and that's where they're processed in the past.

283
01:47:49,897 --> 01:47:56,683
[SPEAKER_16]: We used to welcome students at the individual house offices, C1, C2, and C3.

284
01:47:57,264 --> 01:48:10,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we have it in one central location where all students are processed if they are tardy, and then they are able to go to whatever classroom they need, period, that they should be attending.

285
01:48:12,037 --> 01:48:12,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Number four.

286
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:23,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Ensuring that all students and adults are aware of procedures related to bullying prevention reporting and investigation.

287
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:41,766
[SPEAKER_16]: student sessions, the first day, the following day when we had come back from school, we had student sessions by ninth grade, 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade.

288
01:48:42,406 --> 01:48:51,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Also within the updated guide, we have active links regarding bullying and what steps

289
01:48:52,228 --> 01:48:58,912
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's an appendix, and it says properly investigating claims of bullying.

290
01:48:59,412 --> 01:49:08,738
[SPEAKER_16]: And they give the page numbers as well, pages 44 to 46, which refers to the hard copy handbook that all students received.

291
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:16,703
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to that, step number five, the anonymous reporting system.

292
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:46,263
[SPEAKER_16]: On January 18th, next week, our students are going to be trained with the see something, say something anonymous reporting tip line, where students will be trained, they'll be able to download the app on their phones if they have it, and it will be anonymous, and they will be able to report

293
01:49:47,123 --> 01:49:58,572
[SPEAKER_16]: something that they're aware of and that it will, again, if people felt intimidated or they were worried about it, this is now an additional measure where they will be able to report it.

294
01:49:58,712 --> 01:50:12,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not only something that could be happening, it could be evidence of seeing inappropriate graffiti or hate speech or other things that shouldn't be taking place.

295
01:50:12,622 --> 01:50:15,885
[SPEAKER_16]: This, again, is an opportunity for students to be able

296
01:50:16,425 --> 01:50:38,605
[SPEAKER_16]: to report anonymously administrators have been trained, and we are continuing to train teachers will receive training so they'll understand how this program works at when this coming Wednesday's professional development session, Michelle men will be rolling out that training.

297
01:50:39,145 --> 01:50:42,027
[SPEAKER_16]: And then students will be trained next week.

298
01:50:43,108 --> 01:50:50,232
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it's the 18th on how that program works so we're looking forward to that anonymous reporting system.

299
01:50:51,713 --> 01:50:56,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, as I mentioned earlier, number six we updated the student handbook.

300
01:50:56,896 --> 01:51:09,311
[SPEAKER_16]: and gave an abbreviated 10 page section, which, you know, gives the key areas where they have either been shifts or adjustments made to the student handbook.

301
01:51:10,681 --> 01:51:20,211
[SPEAKER_16]: For number seven, we're reminding all families and students about all of the counseling support services and in my remarks today.

302
01:51:20,231 --> 01:51:22,673
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to care solace.

303
01:51:24,035 --> 01:51:33,124
[SPEAKER_16]: I did mention that there is now the Massachusetts behavioral helpline which is available for the entire school community as well.

304
01:51:36,783 --> 01:51:43,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Bullet number eight, which will be part of my next presentation as well.

305
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:51,771
[SPEAKER_16]: We have hired and are working with the person of Mr. Michael Welch to support our high school administrative team.

306
01:51:52,831 --> 01:52:06,707
[SPEAKER_16]: And really look at the high school in particular focusing on culture, climate, looking at discipline safety for the remainder of this year providing consult and guidance to us.

307
01:52:11,698 --> 01:52:20,067
[SPEAKER_16]: We will be administering parent and student surveys through panorama education.

308
01:52:21,429 --> 01:52:27,735
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, it's a confidential school culture and climate survey, and our high school students.

309
01:52:28,716 --> 01:52:48,270
[SPEAKER_16]: My parents and guardians and some of our school committee members met this week with today's Monday so they met last week with Dr. Cushing, and we're giving additional suggestions in input for things that could possibly be added to the survey so we are continuing to take that feedback.

310
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:51,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Also to help the school with.

311
01:52:53,994 --> 01:53:09,325
[SPEAKER_16]: emergency communications, we will be working, looking to hire a dedicated communications director who will be able to help us with comprehensive communications district wide.

312
01:53:10,005 --> 01:53:22,935
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the 10 key points of the action plan of things that have been taking place since school started last week and things that we're going to continue to work on.

313
01:53:23,655 --> 01:53:26,396
[SPEAKER_16]: but I also want to just highlight a few things.

314
01:53:27,456 --> 01:53:32,417
[SPEAKER_16]: First, you can see these are one of the measures that will be going out to students.

315
01:53:33,638 --> 01:53:42,580
[SPEAKER_16]: This blue bathroom pass is for the restrooms and all teachers will be receiving these passes.

316
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:50,602
[SPEAKER_16]: So as students are in the hallway, if they're going to the restroom, they will have a pass, it will be labeled,

317
01:53:51,102 --> 01:54:01,010
[SPEAKER_16]: with the classroom that they're coming from, so that they're able to go to the restroom, and it's easily identifiable, they can go and return to their classroom.

318
01:54:01,571 --> 01:54:05,975
[SPEAKER_16]: If a student needs to leave the classroom for a different purpose.

319
01:54:06,435 --> 01:54:07,956
[SPEAKER_16]: We are also instituting

320
01:54:08,877 --> 01:54:21,121
[SPEAKER_16]: The red hall pass, and the red hall pass can be a student going to the nurse's office, going to visit a guidance Councilor, possibly, you know, they need to go to the library for something or the main office.

321
01:54:21,641 --> 01:54:26,202
[SPEAKER_16]: So teachers will be given these passes, they will be labeled.

322
01:54:26,682 --> 01:54:33,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And as students are traveling through the hallways, we'll be able to identify why they are in the hallway.

323
01:54:35,305 --> 01:54:42,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Any adult who's monitoring at that point in time will be able to just know that we can give an account for where they are at.

324
01:54:43,712 --> 01:54:57,084
[SPEAKER_16]: We also still have the eHaul Pass system, which is an online system where the students can go online, they can have the app on their phone, and they can use that system as well.

325
01:54:57,611 --> 01:55:05,452
[SPEAKER_16]: and that can be checked by teachers or administrators who are on duty to look at the E-Haul Pass system.

326
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:25,676
[SPEAKER_16]: So since the event took place, we have had the information system meetings with students where we did discuss the key shifts that were taking place with the guide, but we also had several listening sessions and we are going to continue to provide students with opportunities

327
01:55:26,383 --> 01:55:36,666
[SPEAKER_16]: to share their thoughts, and I can say that I had students come and visit me I met with students in my office I met with students in the library.

328
01:55:37,107 --> 01:55:44,049
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor also attended one of the listening sessions in the information session for students

329
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:48,753
[SPEAKER_16]: When school reopened, we also had listening sessions for staff.

330
01:55:50,814 --> 01:55:54,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are just continuing to provide those opportunities.

331
01:55:54,217 --> 01:56:03,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the opportunity to walk the halls one day last week with member Hays, who was able to kind of see the new system in place.

332
01:56:03,925 --> 01:56:11,512
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I can positively report that there is a noted shift, a noted difference at the high school.

333
01:56:12,933 --> 01:56:14,354
[SPEAKER_16]: The hallways are clear.

334
01:56:15,174 --> 01:56:16,315
[SPEAKER_16]: The hallways are quiet.

335
01:56:16,395 --> 01:56:18,176
[SPEAKER_16]: The bathrooms are orderly.

336
01:56:18,256 --> 01:56:22,059
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not having overcrowding in the bathrooms at all.

337
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:24,220
[SPEAKER_16]: It's two students at a time.

338
01:56:25,001 --> 01:56:29,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And the feedback has been fairly, fairly positive.

339
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:36,088
[SPEAKER_16]: One additional shift that I didn't talk about was students who were cutting class.

340
01:56:37,683 --> 01:56:49,029
[SPEAKER_16]: One new thing that we did institute working with the teachers is if a student were to cut a class or not be present the teachers have been using one of our.

341
01:56:49,648 --> 01:57:00,114
[SPEAKER_16]: special platforms called talking points, and they just send a little message to the parents to let them know that a student may not have been in the class.

342
01:57:00,594 --> 01:57:03,496
[SPEAKER_16]: And for that reason, they're notifying them.

343
01:57:04,157 --> 01:57:07,559
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are just some of the slight shifts that have taken place.

344
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:16,401
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can positively report that it has made a drastic difference just in this short period of time.

345
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:23,163
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look forward to seeing continued shifts and improvement as we go forward.

346
01:57:25,443 --> 01:57:25,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

347
01:57:27,524 --> 01:57:28,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Questions from the committee?

348
01:57:30,925 --> 01:57:31,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

349
01:57:33,204 --> 01:57:33,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

350
01:57:33,664 --> 01:57:36,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just a couple questions.

351
01:57:36,566 --> 01:57:45,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm particularly interested in item number two and item number three and item number four on the action plan.

352
01:57:45,793 --> 01:57:58,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like there's been an immediate response to put some structures in place to address these topics, which I think is a good thing.

353
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think my question is, or I guess my question is, who is doing those things?

354
01:58:03,942 --> 01:58:07,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it sustainable for them to continue to do those things into the future?

355
01:58:07,724 --> 01:58:15,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not, what is our plan that those actions actually can be sustainable?

356
01:58:15,747 --> 01:58:26,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I'm really sensitive to and appreciative of all the people who have put all their hands on deck to address some of these issues that have gone on for too long.

357
01:58:26,592 --> 01:58:27,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also am,

358
01:58:27,938 --> 01:58:35,280
[SPEAKER_02]: very aware of the work they're supposed to be doing in there every single day, which probably doesn't include some of the things we're asking them to do right now.

359
01:58:36,101 --> 01:58:50,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm concerned about that sustainability going forward and what the plan is to make sure that that can continue without being massively disruptive to everything else that has to happen in the district.

360
01:58:50,768 --> 01:58:58,090
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the things that we did when we asked for support and help for all hands on deck.

361
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:09,313
[SPEAKER_16]: When we asked for the teachers to provide additional support we did include compensation because some of the teachers, it could have been a prep period.

362
01:59:09,673 --> 01:59:12,054
[SPEAKER_16]: So where they would have been preparing during the day.

363
01:59:12,734 --> 01:59:14,776
[SPEAKER_16]: They have volunteered.

364
01:59:14,796 --> 01:59:23,663
[SPEAKER_16]: They've given up that particular period of prep, and they said okay I will be part of monitoring the hallway.

365
01:59:24,203 --> 01:59:25,944
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was something which.

366
01:59:28,186 --> 01:59:31,209
[SPEAKER_16]: bathroom monitoring in the hallway monitoring.

367
01:59:32,871 --> 01:59:46,244
[SPEAKER_16]: That was something that we weren't really doing to that level we had teacher support during lunches, there were teachers who were providing additional lunch support and that's something that happened

368
01:59:46,764 --> 01:59:55,729
[SPEAKER_16]: in the past, but asking for specific support with naming the different areas of the building.

369
01:59:57,009 --> 02:00:05,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is something that we're, you know, when the incident initially took place, we really, it was everyone.

370
02:00:05,293 --> 02:00:09,936
[SPEAKER_16]: There were a lot of, almost more adults in the hallway than there were students.

371
02:00:10,816 --> 02:00:13,698
[SPEAKER_16]: As we are getting back into the routine,

372
02:00:14,498 --> 02:00:18,779
[SPEAKER_16]: of going to class once the bell rings and passing period has happened.

373
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:29,321
[SPEAKER_16]: It hasn't been necessary to keep as large a number because we do have our building monitors that are already in the building.

374
02:00:30,501 --> 02:00:35,803
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two SROs that are just walking and just making sure that things are peaceful.

375
02:00:35,843 --> 02:00:42,684
[SPEAKER_16]: So we do have staff, we have five building monitors right now, and we are still looking to increase that.

376
02:00:43,244 --> 02:00:47,767
[SPEAKER_16]: So at any given time, and we have seven administrators at the high school.

377
02:00:48,247 --> 02:00:56,971
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you add all of those school-based administrators, and that's not talking about our other administrators that are central office-based.

378
02:00:57,892 --> 02:01:05,916
[SPEAKER_16]: So from a sustainability perspective, I don't think we're going to need to have a large number of people

379
02:01:09,238 --> 02:01:15,824
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, all hands on deck I think it's cool we're going to be able to get to a manageable number of staff, supporting the high school.

380
02:01:16,484 --> 02:01:24,611
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that that's what I would say so from a sustainability, we may end up saying we might need, you know,

381
02:01:25,832 --> 02:01:53,173
[SPEAKER_16]: one or two other teachers or someone to help like in the lunches we did add an additional person, and the teachers have graciously, you know, signed up, and, you know, I've, we've been very appreciative of the support, and just looking at what we can do with the staff that we have, and having a reasonable number of additional staff at different points throughout the building.

382
02:01:54,616 --> 02:01:55,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

383
02:01:55,356 --> 02:02:07,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make sure that it's clear that if you need support from a funding perspective, please tell us what those things are.

384
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:10,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we're going to come up on budget season really fast.

385
02:02:10,739 --> 02:02:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can certainly talk about this again as part of the operating budget.

386
02:02:16,601 --> 02:02:21,002
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to hear from you if there is support or infrastructure that's lacking.

387
02:02:23,547 --> 02:02:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that this is sustainable through brute force is fraught for lots of reasons.

388
02:02:30,488 --> 02:02:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure that if there are things that we need to do so that we can have a little bit more of an efficient way to do these things, that we are pursuing that.

389
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:49,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that means investments, I think we're all here to support that and tell the community why it's necessary.

390
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely.

391
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:59,802
[SPEAKER_16]: I fully am on board with that as we are continuing to just look at how the high school is, how it's functioning, what's working, what isn't working.

392
02:03:00,542 --> 02:03:12,064
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're continuing to meet today, all of central office and all of the administrative team, including Janet Connors, who's with the building monitors.

393
02:03:13,384 --> 02:03:19,005
[SPEAKER_16]: We sat down and we are meeting, we are talking, we are giving feedback to one another.

394
02:03:19,685 --> 02:03:22,666
[SPEAKER_16]: and just saying okay what else can we do to approve.

395
02:03:24,186 --> 02:03:31,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Michael Welch was there as well as you know, a listener and observer and just, if so it's it's a group effort.

396
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:40,470
[SPEAKER_16]: And really, Michelle man was there, looking at what we're doing and how we can continue to improve and tweak.

397
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:48,452
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is a work in progress but we are not going to shy away from asking for additional resources in key areas.

398
02:03:48,956 --> 02:03:49,957
[SPEAKER_16]: during the budget season.

399
02:03:51,057 --> 02:03:51,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

400
02:03:51,577 --> 02:03:59,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other request that I have, this school committee is supposed to review and sign off on handbooks on an annual basis.

401
02:03:59,742 --> 02:04:02,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never done that since I've been here.

402
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am pretty certain that we've talked about it a couple of times.

403
02:04:06,746 --> 02:04:17,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to ask for you to put forward a schedule to us of how you will present those handbooks to us for our review for the upcoming school year.

404
02:04:17,571 --> 02:04:17,611
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

405
02:04:19,028 --> 02:04:29,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be really great if there was some tracking mechanism when you share those documents with us so we can understand like what does it look like today and what are you proposing the changes are.

406
02:04:29,473 --> 02:04:45,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know I think these like we just need to make sure that there's enough time for us to do a good diligent job of that because it's not been done as long as we've been on the committee, so I think that's it's really important that we get into a better.

407
02:04:46,252 --> 02:04:48,294
[SPEAKER_02]: and more consistent annual process to do that.

408
02:04:48,374 --> 02:04:48,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Schedule.

409
02:04:48,894 --> 02:04:49,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

410
02:04:49,174 --> 02:04:50,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Prior to the end of the school year.

411
02:04:50,755 --> 02:04:51,076
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll do.

412
02:04:51,096 --> 02:04:51,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do.

413
02:04:51,516 --> 02:04:51,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

414
02:04:52,837 --> 02:04:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Hays.

415
02:04:55,159 --> 02:04:55,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

416
02:04:56,119 --> 02:05:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for this, for the action plan and for the work that's been done, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

417
02:05:01,303 --> 02:05:05,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And I particularly like the, you know, the graphic and the way that it's laid out very clearly.

418
02:05:05,326 --> 02:05:06,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that.

419
02:05:07,008 --> 02:05:09,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about the anonymous reporting system.

420
02:05:09,349 --> 02:05:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could share a little bit more about that, what the infrastructure of that is actually going to look like.

421
02:05:14,393 --> 02:05:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a, is this a,

422
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:19,373
[SPEAKER_06]: technology that we have that we're going to be able to use?

423
02:05:19,433 --> 02:05:23,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it, you know, traditional paper system?

424
02:05:23,518 --> 02:05:25,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what is that actually going to look like?

425
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:26,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And where's that data going to go?

426
02:05:26,482 --> 02:05:29,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And how will we be kept informed of it?

427
02:05:31,468 --> 02:05:42,711
[SPEAKER_16]: So when I went through the training, it's an online platform that is affiliated with the Sandy Hook, see something, say something.

428
02:05:42,751 --> 02:05:55,755
[SPEAKER_16]: And they had us as administrators, after we got trained, they had us do like a mock training where you had to like log in and each person would report in.

429
02:05:55,815 --> 02:05:58,116
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd have like a specialized

430
02:05:58,876 --> 02:06:12,724
[SPEAKER_16]: identification for for administrators, and then it goes to like a reporting system where the information is taken in, and you can follow up with it without knowing

431
02:06:13,984 --> 02:06:23,291
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're aware that some information will be timely, some information might be this happened, or the information may be a little more vague.

432
02:06:23,711 --> 02:06:30,175
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is kind of like another layer, I should say, where there's analysis that takes place.

433
02:06:32,197 --> 02:06:37,620
[SPEAKER_16]: So the students, when they get trained, they will download the app onto their telephones.

434
02:06:38,561 --> 02:06:39,702
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is not...

435
02:06:41,743 --> 02:06:49,650
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not something that you're writing like paper longhand, it's like a digital, it's essentially an app.

436
02:06:50,070 --> 02:07:03,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you put the information in the app, it gets logged and then it gets sent to the key individuals who would need to be alerted that something was added to the platform.

437
02:07:05,223 --> 02:07:08,446
[SPEAKER_16]: And depending on the level of seriousness,

438
02:07:11,627 --> 02:07:19,232
[SPEAKER_16]: It will go to like a 911 level or something like that and I don't know if anyone Dr crushing if you want to jump in.

439
02:07:20,232 --> 02:07:20,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Sandy hook line.

440
02:07:27,597 --> 02:07:36,342
[SPEAKER_18]: So first I want to give full credit to Stacey showman and our counseling staff for reaching out seeking out this application so this is a free application through Sandy have promised.

441
02:07:36,823 --> 02:07:52,446
[SPEAKER_18]: And what it does is it essentially filters the incidents as they come in, and those of highest concern will be sent through police dispatch, whereas others will be sent to the school.

442
02:07:52,546 --> 02:08:03,809
[SPEAKER_18]: So if somebody is reporting, you know, let your mind run wild, something very concerning, something very high needs, and that'll trigger an immediate call to the police, as well as a notification of the school as well.

443
02:08:05,499 --> 02:08:12,345
[SPEAKER_18]: if it's something a little bit lower of, you know, bullying or something along those lines, it'll trigger a school response as opposed to a police response.

444
02:08:12,425 --> 02:08:25,616
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it's varied and the training is quite extensive and there's a high bar that San Diego Promise requires school districts to meet in order to attain and utilize this program.

445
02:08:26,337 --> 02:08:30,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if I may just point out, this is just one avenue.

446
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:32,402
[SPEAKER_07]: If you went to the

447
02:08:33,982 --> 02:08:38,063
[SPEAKER_07]: meetings, they were by grade level on the first day back last week.

448
02:08:38,643 --> 02:08:45,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Each grade level was able to see a picture and the name associated with anybody in the building that could be a trusted adult.

449
02:08:46,244 --> 02:08:57,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came to news for me that there is plenty of people that our children, teens can report to, whether that be anonymously or not.

450
02:08:57,626 --> 02:09:02,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And so 12 total mental health professionals in the building

451
02:09:02,563 --> 02:09:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: six guidance Councilors, principal, three assistants, and the list goes on.

452
02:09:06,866 --> 02:09:13,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And the students were shown every name and picture so that they have an idea of where they are in the building, who they are.

453
02:09:13,509 --> 02:09:18,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one important thing that has changed in the last two weeks is it was going to be a form survey.

454
02:09:19,013 --> 02:09:23,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And between Peter and Joan, I know you're working on it a great deal, the survey.

455
02:09:23,515 --> 02:09:27,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pushing very hard behind the scenes that it not be a form survey, that we have a survey

456
02:09:28,727 --> 02:09:35,832
[SPEAKER_07]: that we develop, take our time, an extra couple of weeks to develop that is gonna fit the needs of our students and our teachers and our families.

457
02:09:36,773 --> 02:09:43,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Then some of the questions are gonna be based off of what we've learned in the listening sessions, in the class meetings.

458
02:09:44,258 --> 02:09:49,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And for an example, it's, do you have a trusted adult in the building that you can go to voice a concern to?

459
02:09:49,702 --> 02:09:54,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, do you want one so that you can connect students directly?

460
02:09:54,446 --> 02:09:55,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just one example.

461
02:09:56,854 --> 02:10:00,756
[SPEAKER_07]: The administration is trying to do this right and be thoughtful, and I appreciate that.

462
02:10:00,776 --> 02:10:04,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pushing for it, and I'm getting good response.

463
02:10:04,218 --> 02:10:05,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to point that out.

464
02:10:05,839 --> 02:10:10,022
[SPEAKER_07]: There are trusted people in the building, plenty of them that our students can go to.

465
02:10:10,302 --> 02:10:13,524
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another means of, I want to be completely anonymous.

466
02:10:13,724 --> 02:10:14,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to report to this line.

467
02:10:15,745 --> 02:10:20,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor, if I can, to that end, we are also, as many of you know, are right now doing a health curriculum review.

468
02:10:21,569 --> 02:10:25,771
[SPEAKER_18]: We have an extraordinarily talented group of people who have stepped up to the plate.

469
02:10:26,423 --> 02:10:33,966
[SPEAKER_18]: And on this past Wednesday at a meeting, I put the charge to them to think of school safety questions that they might consider.

470
02:10:34,006 --> 02:10:35,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're also researching.

471
02:10:35,627 --> 02:10:48,212
[SPEAKER_18]: The team at Panorama is not only using their research team to help us build questions, but they've reached out to their partners throughout other school districts who have faced these challenges to also see what questions we can bring in.

472
02:10:48,432 --> 02:10:50,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are three specific avenues.

473
02:10:51,823 --> 02:11:02,092
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, us in the buildings, our HECAT team and Panorama with two avenues internally there, the research team, as well as reaching out to other school districts.

474
02:11:03,113 --> 02:11:04,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin and member Hays.

475
02:11:04,694 --> 02:11:04,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

476
02:11:05,014 --> 02:11:05,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to follow up to that.

477
02:11:05,815 --> 02:11:06,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

478
02:11:06,135 --> 02:11:06,896
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very helpful.

479
02:11:07,256 --> 02:11:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wondering, I'm sure that obviously because it's online, there'll be data collection specific to this anonymous line.

480
02:11:15,063 --> 02:11:16,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be data collection.

481
02:11:16,124 --> 02:11:19,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be an ability to report how many calls came in or how many,

482
02:11:20,646 --> 02:11:36,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Anonymous reports were made, you know, sort of what sort of, you know, context, they were in generally that sort of thing, which department will be handling the response to that is not going to be stationed showman's department or is it, it'll be a collaboration between the counseling and school leadership.

483
02:11:37,099 --> 02:11:40,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and this is that this is going to be at each school.

484
02:11:40,181 --> 02:11:43,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and an opportunity at each school for students to access this.

485
02:11:43,703 --> 02:11:54,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, we need to make sure that not only that not everything that not every burden falls on our counseling staff that it also is supported by our school leaders as well.

486
02:11:57,691 --> 02:11:59,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, just one more.

487
02:11:59,452 --> 02:11:59,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

488
02:11:59,932 --> 02:12:00,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we could think about.

489
02:12:02,306 --> 02:12:02,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

490
02:12:02,486 --> 02:12:16,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Bone, if we could think about some either PECS images or social stories or something like that, that will support students who don't communicate with words or otherwise that are able to access this line as well.

491
02:12:16,609 --> 02:12:26,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Most students with IEPs have bullying plans in their IEP anyway, but if there could be some support around this line existing, that would be really helpful for those classrooms.

492
02:12:28,011 --> 02:12:28,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Good suggestion.

493
02:12:29,172 --> 02:12:29,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

494
02:12:30,152 --> 02:12:30,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

495
02:12:31,027 --> 02:12:32,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays, then Member Graham.

496
02:12:33,808 --> 02:12:34,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

497
02:12:34,528 --> 02:12:37,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had a few, few questions, some of them might be very quick, hopefully.

498
02:12:38,308 --> 02:12:55,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a date for the survey yet I, I feel like maybe that was already answered because you said you're taking a little extra time to try to buy the end of January, we would like to administer that Dr. Cushing is working with panorama, and the end of January first week or so of February, we really do.

499
02:12:57,128 --> 02:13:03,374
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be some questions that come directly from panorama that nationally norm nationally metric, but then when we launch our own.

500
02:13:04,475 --> 02:13:11,381
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to make sure that they're collecting the really important data and we're not so worried much about survey metrics in this realm.

501
02:13:12,021 --> 02:13:20,429
[SPEAKER_18]: As you know, but we want to make sure we're collecting really good viable data that's going to help inform our practice moving forward to make the changes students and families expect

502
02:13:21,636 --> 02:13:34,020
[SPEAKER_19]: And then have we put any thought into, and maybe this goes towards resources and what the school committee can do for you, giving this survey on a yearly basis, even twice a year.

503
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:38,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I looked it up and there's some school systems in the area who seem to be giving this kind of a survey.

504
02:13:38,141 --> 02:13:42,202
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, I think it was the Panorama company or platform.

505
02:13:43,463 --> 02:13:49,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Just something to think about in the future, just to keep getting this information from students and families.

506
02:13:49,265 --> 02:13:50,525
[SPEAKER_19]: The world is ever-changing.

507
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:57,975
[SPEAKER_19]: our needs are going to change and it would be nice to have this information on a, maybe an annual, maybe even by, I don't know.

508
02:13:58,155 --> 02:14:09,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what the costs of it are and what the feasibility would be, but just something to think about because I think, you know, we know that getting the student information was huge for us with this.

509
02:14:09,341 --> 02:14:15,724
[SPEAKER_19]: This was really, um, eyeopening to a lot of people, um, what we needed and what, what was going on.

510
02:14:15,964 --> 02:14:20,326
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so the more often you can get that kind of information, I think, you know,

511
02:14:20,717 --> 02:14:24,382
[SPEAKER_19]: the better, which also leads to my next question.

512
02:14:24,422 --> 02:14:30,850
[SPEAKER_19]: I was wondering about the listening sessions and kind of how is data being collected from those listening sessions?

513
02:14:32,392 --> 02:14:38,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it would be good to know, obviously, to figure out are there certain groups of students who are feeling

514
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:55,596
[SPEAKER_19]: more uncomfortable than others or certain concerns that crop up for, you know, males versus females, maybe our LGBTQ population, maybe our students of color, are we actually collecting the information in a way that we could look at it in that depth?

515
02:14:57,026 --> 02:15:17,085
[SPEAKER_16]: So, the listening sessions that I attended there, they were made up of like a diverse group of students so we had English learners we do want to, for those that have limited English, we do want to get some translated sessions for them to make sure that they're understanding all of what's being said.

516
02:15:18,106 --> 02:15:24,291
[SPEAKER_16]: But we did have smaller group sessions, and we are going to continue to get feedback from the students.

517
02:15:25,032 --> 02:15:30,296
[SPEAKER_16]: And the things that the students said, some of them were quite comical.

518
02:15:30,376 --> 02:15:36,781
[SPEAKER_16]: They had interesting perspectives on the new rules that are coming down.

519
02:15:36,821 --> 02:15:38,283
[SPEAKER_16]: They're aware of what's happening.

520
02:15:38,943 --> 02:15:42,306
[SPEAKER_16]: But after they said those pieces, honestly,

521
02:15:44,548 --> 02:15:49,252
[SPEAKER_16]: majority of students that I've spoken with and have asked them, you know, how do you feel?

522
02:15:49,272 --> 02:16:01,462
[SPEAKER_16]: They all have talked about definitely feeling safer and feeling like the bathrooms, which used to be an area of, you know, large congregating, large groups of students.

523
02:16:01,943 --> 02:16:08,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that there are only two students, they feel like that's kind of like a stress-free experience for them.

524
02:16:09,642 --> 02:16:13,744
[SPEAKER_19]: I just was wondering, as you're doing those listening sessions, someone writing down.

525
02:16:14,084 --> 02:16:36,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it is being recorded, it is being recorded notes are being taken on the guidance Councilors, Michelle men, the different Councilors who have been present for those as well they have been taking notes and just capturing like the key ideas key themes, some of the students keep, you know, they may be repeating, you know, the same thing over and over again.

526
02:16:38,096 --> 02:16:46,403
[SPEAKER_16]: If that happens, they're not gonna record it over and over again, but it's just noted that this is something that they would like us to definitely pay attention to.

527
02:16:46,423 --> 02:17:02,115
[SPEAKER_19]: And one last request I had, or maybe you're already doing this, for the counseling services and making sure that, or the support services, those phone numbers you gave us, are those being posted on the school website so people have a central place they could go to find those?

528
02:17:02,831 --> 02:17:05,192
[SPEAKER_19]: rather than, you know, trying to remember from the meeting.

529
02:17:06,453 --> 02:17:21,161
[SPEAKER_16]: I should make sure I'm not sure if the slide deck if we had posted that but I can definitely get the informational slide deck or make minor tweaks to it so that parents can also know who's serving in what capacity.

530
02:17:21,521 --> 02:17:24,983
[SPEAKER_19]: And those numbers in the community I was thinking of specifically because those are newer.

531
02:17:26,701 --> 02:17:29,562
[SPEAKER_19]: And the care solace, just if there's a- Oh, those phone numbers.

532
02:17:29,602 --> 02:17:30,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, yes.

533
02:17:30,262 --> 02:17:33,163
[SPEAKER_16]: I can definitely get that in a different format.

534
02:17:33,563 --> 02:17:37,785
[SPEAKER_16]: So people will know these are additional resources that are available for the community.

535
02:17:37,825 --> 02:17:38,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

536
02:17:38,625 --> 02:17:39,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

537
02:17:39,385 --> 02:17:56,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And on that note, Member Hays, I did suggest that a bulletin board be put up somewhere in the high school with every picture of a trusted somebody, all the adults within the school with the names and phone numbers to the hotline and to care solace, things like that.

538
02:17:56,630 --> 02:18:01,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important to put on the website and post in the school so the students have it too.

539
02:18:01,811 --> 02:18:08,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with regards to the listening sessions, I was able to make two out of the four, and I took notes and sent mine over to Ms.

540
02:18:08,052 --> 02:18:10,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Glusi, but I know that the Councilors were taking notes.

541
02:18:11,152 --> 02:18:25,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think it's important that we do form a list of questions that came from those sessions that we weren't able to answer so that we can follow up with our students, whether that's by one formal email in the next week or two, just to let them know they have been heard

542
02:18:26,363 --> 02:18:32,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Dr. Cushing reached out to the first listening session, which was four amazing students who had so much to say.

543
02:18:32,607 --> 02:18:36,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And a big theme of theirs was how to get communication.

544
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really love checking email.

545
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:39,292
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting too many of them.

546
02:18:39,712 --> 02:18:45,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dr. Cushing is going to meet with them and hopefully create a social media platform because that seems to be where they want to get their information.

547
02:18:46,036 --> 02:18:48,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, well, you could be leaders and do it yourself.

548
02:18:48,297 --> 02:18:55,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of good did come out of the sessions, but I do ask that any questions that weren't able to answer in those four sessions are

549
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of outlined to the students with some answers.

550
02:19:00,461 --> 02:19:00,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

551
02:19:02,402 --> 02:19:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

552
02:19:04,082 --> 02:19:13,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarding the survey that's going out, how does that square with the RFP that we are in the process of releasing to do something very similar?

553
02:19:13,705 --> 02:19:20,807
[SPEAKER_18]: So the RFP specifically articulates that they need to work with any current panorama data.

554
02:19:21,317 --> 02:19:30,063
[SPEAKER_18]: unless the successful candidate for the RFP can articulate how they will implement that data as well as whatever their own survey might be.

555
02:19:30,584 --> 02:19:42,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I left open room for flexibility that used the panorama, which just so you're aware is about $19,000 a year, and paid for right now out of the hate crimes grant.

556
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:58,414
[SPEAKER_18]: but then so that there is a window for whoever the successful company is to do the culture and climate work to use either the panorama or to use that in conjunction with whatever survey model they might bring in that's native to their purposes.

557
02:19:59,075 --> 02:20:00,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

558
02:20:00,675 --> 02:20:01,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Two other questions.

559
02:20:02,036 --> 02:20:03,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see that Desi has

560
02:20:05,291 --> 02:20:09,756
[SPEAKER_02]: a grant opportunity on their website around violence prevention in schools.

561
02:20:10,077 --> 02:20:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if we are planning to apply for that or if that's a good fit for our needs.

562
02:20:15,222 --> 02:20:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did see that a couple of community members had mentioned it to me.

563
02:20:18,406 --> 02:20:21,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to make sure that we discussed it here.

564
02:20:21,609 --> 02:20:24,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham, I'm actually meeting with a community member on that grant tomorrow at 11.

565
02:20:24,773 --> 02:20:24,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

566
02:20:26,127 --> 02:20:27,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

567
02:20:27,307 --> 02:20:33,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my last I guess it's a request when you know we talked.

568
02:20:33,629 --> 02:20:46,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably a year ago now and Stacey Shulman was here and I asked her a question around do students know how to access the services that are available to them.

569
02:20:46,432 --> 02:20:47,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did say

570
02:20:47,847 --> 02:20:53,391
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at that time, this was a year ago, that they were finding that the answer was no, not really.

571
02:20:54,291 --> 02:20:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That students really did still have, like, were unaware.

572
02:20:59,435 --> 02:21:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you all have been working on that.

573
02:21:01,716 --> 02:21:12,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing that I am hearing, particularly from parents and students, is that beyond just knowing that those services are available for you to reach out and ask for help,

574
02:21:15,074 --> 02:21:17,095
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I have for Ms.

575
02:21:17,135 --> 02:21:31,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Schulman to consider is how are we identifying people we should be reaching out to and not waiting for students to get to a place or a space or a willingness to come seeking services?

576
02:21:31,259 --> 02:21:42,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we be more proactive with those students who we see in the building who may be struggling for one reason or another to provide some outreach to them and let them proactively know what the options are for them

577
02:21:43,584 --> 02:21:50,866
[SPEAKER_02]: What services are available and that there are like people there to help because I think sometimes as you know with students.

578
02:21:52,087 --> 02:21:59,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they're like willing to go out and seek services for themselves is as individual as like all the students in the building are so.

579
02:22:00,353 --> 02:22:16,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that there's a mechanism there too among the adults in the building that we can identify students who might need some of that help and find a way to reach students who may not have found the way or the desire to reach us first.

580
02:22:17,321 --> 02:22:21,387
[SPEAKER_16]: So there, there is I what was coming to mind as you were talking.

581
02:22:22,248 --> 02:22:25,813
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have students that have been identified for different reasons.

582
02:22:26,654 --> 02:22:30,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes it is, they may be a family that has higher needs.

583
02:22:31,856 --> 02:22:36,220
[SPEAKER_16]: potentially they could be homeless and we're making sure that they have additional supports.

584
02:22:36,761 --> 02:22:56,938
[SPEAKER_16]: We also could have students that have, especially in light of students that are skipping class or cutting class, which is something that, you know, we were like, we need to put additional layers in because we kind of had given a little more leeway and we needed to say, no, no, no, no, we need to like,

585
02:22:58,259 --> 02:23:00,100
[SPEAKER_16]: communicate with parents a lot earlier.

586
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,760
[SPEAKER_16]: So parents would just be in the know.

587
02:23:02,380 --> 02:23:04,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are students that we're watching.

588
02:23:04,341 --> 02:23:15,543
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have student support teams like an SST for students that for different reasons may start to tick different boxes.

589
02:23:15,603 --> 02:23:20,004
[SPEAKER_16]: And we say, okay, we need to keep our eyes and start providing additional supports.

590
02:23:20,425 --> 02:23:25,406
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are always a few students that could slip through the cracks one way or the other.

591
02:23:26,506 --> 02:23:34,236
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that is why we really are like with the presentation that we had with what the training they're going to have next week.

592
02:23:35,378 --> 02:23:43,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're making a real concerted effort to say like help is available, we have a lot of.

593
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:54,476
[SPEAKER_16]: You know Councilors and adjustment Councilors and guidance Councilors and school psychologists we have them located in like suites at the high school on every single floor.

594
02:23:55,176 --> 02:24:01,980
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was something that I think was clearly articulated so I didn't think to ask me showman.

595
02:24:03,081 --> 02:24:05,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Has there been a significant uptick.

596
02:24:06,923 --> 02:24:10,445
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do have a lot of supports available and.

597
02:24:11,866 --> 02:24:20,010
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to continue to make sure that those supports are being accessed by the students so we can continue to kind of drill down in those areas.

598
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:20,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

599
02:24:24,812 --> 02:24:26,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to student rep Dominic.

600
02:24:26,853 --> 02:24:27,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Bruno.

601
02:24:28,783 --> 02:24:32,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I have a quick question in regards to distribution of the surveys.

602
02:24:32,924 --> 02:24:46,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do you guys have like a rough idea of when they'll be distributed because I know from experience, and Lauren, we both kind of often find like it difficult to complete the survey because of the

603
02:24:46,869 --> 02:24:48,690
[SPEAKER_00]: influx of students on the network.

604
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:54,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes I end up pretty frustrated, because I'm not able to complete it.

605
02:24:54,574 --> 02:25:05,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So has it been considered possibly doing it by grade, maybe taking away from class time, or maybe each day is a different grade during homeroom, etc.

606
02:25:15,718 --> 02:25:16,518
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a great question.

607
02:25:16,558 --> 02:25:17,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Dom.

608
02:25:17,899 --> 02:25:23,364
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we were hoping that the network upgrades would be able to handle it.

609
02:25:24,024 --> 02:25:33,491
[SPEAKER_18]: But if that's still an issue, while we were planning to do it on an extended advisory, we will definitely make alternate plans so that we can have all students complete it.

610
02:25:36,914 --> 02:25:43,699
[SPEAKER_18]: I do want to let everybody know, this was brought up by the student reps to me in one of our meetings, that it is 100% anonymous.

611
02:25:44,867 --> 02:25:53,955
[SPEAKER_18]: So the students don't have to worry about there was a concern about like, Oh, if we're honest or anything like that, the survey is run through panorama, a hundred percent anonymous.

612
02:25:54,655 --> 02:25:56,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and it can be done two ways.

613
02:25:56,097 --> 02:26:08,307
[SPEAKER_18]: It can be done with just a link that students can access or panorama can drive it specifically to students, email addresses, and they will not share that, that discernible information with us.

614
02:26:08,697 --> 02:26:11,218
[SPEAKER_18]: By doing it the second way, we're able to capture demographics.

615
02:26:12,259 --> 02:26:15,941
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing it the first way of just an open link to our students.

616
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:18,762
[SPEAKER_18]: We would not be able to capture those demographics.

617
02:26:19,183 --> 02:26:24,385
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that getting good demographic information at this point is something that we need to consider.

618
02:26:24,745 --> 02:26:27,267
[SPEAKER_18]: So just FYI, but it is 100% anonymous.

619
02:26:27,847 --> 02:26:28,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

620
02:26:29,748 --> 02:26:31,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that concludes our questions.

621
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:33,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if somebody from, oh, member Hays.

622
02:26:35,337 --> 02:26:48,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a question, not so much about what's been put in place for the safety procedures, but just thinking about the incident, the stabbing incident, and the response to it that day.

623
02:26:50,529 --> 02:27:00,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Just wondering if you as a team have met to talk about the response itself, looking at what went well, maybe what didn't go so well, kind of that debriefing.

624
02:27:01,017 --> 02:27:02,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you had a meeting like that yet?

625
02:27:02,798 --> 02:27:03,899
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you planning to do a meeting?

626
02:27:04,368 --> 02:27:10,549
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do an after action review we have not done the formal after action review regarding that.

627
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:12,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean we we've met.

628
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:21,652
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I said like today's debrief has been more on where we are right now but for us to go back and go through all of that.

629
02:27:21,892 --> 02:27:25,233
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we do that, not only as our team, I would like to have.

630
02:27:26,133 --> 02:27:38,161
[SPEAKER_16]: chief and his members of his team that were there, members of fire team that were there, so that I could really hear from all stakeholders that were involved while we were in the middle of the crisis.

631
02:27:38,181 --> 02:27:43,604
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have not set that up, but we do plan on doing that before this month is out.

632
02:27:43,644 --> 02:27:45,686
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do it during the month of January.

633
02:27:45,706 --> 02:27:46,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

634
02:27:47,167 --> 02:27:47,667
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

635
02:27:51,409 --> 02:27:54,872
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no further questions, I don't know if I can make a motion if you want to take the chair.

636
02:27:55,734 --> 02:28:04,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, or if somebody would make a motion that we just get an update on this 10-point action plan at the February 27th or the March 6th meeting.

637
02:28:05,018 --> 02:28:10,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to make a motion that we get an update on this at our February 27th meeting.

638
02:28:11,601 --> 02:28:17,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to get an update on the 10-point action plan on February 27th by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

639
02:28:17,663 --> 02:28:18,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

640
02:28:20,405 --> 02:28:22,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

641
02:28:23,306 --> 02:28:23,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

642
02:28:25,496 --> 02:28:26,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hays?

643
02:28:27,097 --> 02:28:27,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

644
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:28,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

645
02:28:29,717 --> 02:28:29,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

646
02:28:30,998 --> 02:28:31,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

647
02:28:33,459 --> 02:28:33,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

648
02:28:34,779 --> 02:28:35,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone?

649
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:36,480
Yes.

650
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, yes.

651
02:28:39,781 --> 02:28:40,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

652
02:28:40,481 --> 02:28:42,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

653
02:28:42,902 --> 02:28:44,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion is passed.

654
02:28:44,703 --> 02:28:45,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

655
02:28:45,603 --> 02:28:45,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

656
02:28:46,223 --> 02:28:47,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

657
02:28:47,303 --> 02:28:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we move on, I didn't know if there was anyone in the audience who wanted to speak on this topic.

658
02:28:53,486 --> 02:28:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

659
02:28:54,326 --> 02:28:54,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

660
02:29:05,015 --> 02:29:08,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Nicole Branley.

661
02:29:09,718 --> 02:29:11,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just have a couple of questions.

662
02:29:12,841 --> 02:29:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I did reach out to the committee, thanking them for putting this all together because I do think pointing out the positives.

663
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:24,078
[SPEAKER_04]: is as important as pointing out things that would need to be worked on.

664
02:29:24,138 --> 02:29:25,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do appreciate all of this.

665
02:29:27,481 --> 02:29:38,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Assigning the school resource officer in the mayor's communication on December 23rd, you had mentioned that there would be two officers, a female officer and an officer of color.

666
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:44,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just curious if there's gonna be a third officer or what happened with that?

667
02:29:44,715 --> 02:29:47,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Four trained officers, two will be in the building.

668
02:29:48,322 --> 02:29:53,225
[SPEAKER_07]: at most times until unless there's an issue in the police department where they someone needs to get pulled.

669
02:29:53,846 --> 02:29:56,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, for trained fully, fully.

670
02:29:57,328 --> 02:29:57,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

671
02:29:57,708 --> 02:30:02,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And if one gets promoted, our plans are to try to keep it at four.

672
02:30:02,171 --> 02:30:03,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So that can always be two in the building.

673
02:30:04,352 --> 02:30:10,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So two in our building, but for at the department per se, for a fully trained, hopefully, like one had to go out on leave.

674
02:30:11,257 --> 02:30:12,757
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four fully trained officers.

675
02:30:12,857 --> 02:30:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And then zero bro is still to the middle schools.

676
02:30:15,119 --> 02:30:16,920
[SPEAKER_07]: He is still at the middle schools in the high schools.

677
02:30:17,389 --> 02:30:18,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, awesome.

678
02:30:18,531 --> 02:30:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

679
02:30:19,972 --> 02:30:28,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the implementing clear consistent protocols for student identification, check in and hallway presence.

680
02:30:29,164 --> 02:30:30,286
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens when they don't?

681
02:30:31,487 --> 02:30:32,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are some of the consequences?

682
02:30:35,225 --> 02:30:38,187
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're saying when they don't, can you, I didn't hear the first part of the question.

683
02:30:38,807 --> 02:30:43,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they don't have their identification, once identifications are passed out, what if they don't have it?

684
02:30:43,210 --> 02:30:44,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a consequence to that?

685
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:46,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so if a student forgets, there's not a consequence.

686
02:30:46,952 --> 02:30:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's gonna be.

687
02:30:48,332 --> 02:31:03,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so we're gonna have a temporary pass for them, a temporary ID, and each student will be given a lanyard, a breakaway lanyard, and the breakaway lanyards will be colored based on

688
02:31:04,554 --> 02:31:08,060
[SPEAKER_16]: the lunch that they have so that's another added security measure.

689
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:19,397
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll have blue lanyards and gray lanyards and you'll be able to identify if the students in first lunch or second lunch, and for students that have schedules that

690
02:31:19,958 --> 02:31:22,659
[SPEAKER_16]: change, they'll be given a different colored lanyard.

691
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:30,261
[SPEAKER_16]: So if a student were to just rush out the house and forget their ID, they would have a temporary ID for that day.

692
02:31:30,801 --> 02:31:40,564
[SPEAKER_16]: But we are, we have ordered all new IDs for the students because we knew some of them may have thrown their original ones away or just misplaced them.

693
02:31:40,864 --> 02:31:41,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

694
02:31:42,885 --> 02:31:45,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had touched upon just the cutting of the classes.

695
02:31:46,686 --> 02:31:46,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So

696
02:31:47,799 --> 02:31:50,343
[SPEAKER_04]: teachers are going to be using the talking point app if a student.

697
02:31:51,344 --> 02:31:52,686
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the procedure before.

698
02:31:53,367 --> 02:32:00,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there had to be like for offenses, like they were they were given a larger runway.

699
02:32:01,137 --> 02:32:03,681
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it was on the fourth offense that.

700
02:32:06,357 --> 02:32:18,793
[SPEAKER_16]: When the administration was notified, then the assistant principals would be following up with the students and so we've now had it if there's a cut on the first offense.

701
02:32:19,934 --> 02:32:23,939
[SPEAKER_16]: The teacher can send a talking points message.

702
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:45,446
[SPEAKER_16]: to the parents to notify the parents that, you know, Johnny wasn't in math class today or we missed his presence, but there are some students that may be in the guidance office so there's there's a little gray area for some students but for those students were cutting class.

703
02:32:45,506 --> 02:32:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

704
02:32:47,086 --> 02:32:48,447
[SPEAKER_16]: So now they're much much.

705
02:32:49,400 --> 02:33:00,390
[SPEAKER_16]: There's greater scrutiny and sometimes parents might even end up getting two or three messages in a day if their child decided to not stay in class.

706
02:33:00,951 --> 02:33:02,092
[SPEAKER_04]: For a period.

707
02:33:02,412 --> 02:33:04,194
[SPEAKER_16]: It's by the period that we've been doing that.

708
02:33:04,214 --> 02:33:06,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so what is the follow up to that?

709
02:33:06,376 --> 02:33:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it still four offenses?

710
02:33:08,878 --> 02:33:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's followed up by the AP?

711
02:33:11,127 --> 02:33:26,725
[SPEAKER_16]: So depending on each student once it goes into the talking points it's notifying the fam notifying the parents, and then there will be opportunities for you know to have, we would still like to have conversations with the students about like why did you skip.

712
02:33:27,566 --> 02:33:34,827
[SPEAKER_16]: You know humanities or why did you skip this particular class, so there will be some opportunities for that but then clearly.

713
02:33:37,028 --> 02:33:48,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Once you hit a certain threshold there, there will be detention there Saturday detention there's like progressive discipline that will end up taking place but parents will just be notified.

714
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:53,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Earlier, so that parents can partner with us and say hey.

715
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:58,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a message today you were in math class I don't expect to get that message tomorrow.

716
02:33:59,133 --> 02:34:00,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what we're also hoping.

717
02:34:00,874 --> 02:34:05,176
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, when I met with administrators today after school.

718
02:34:06,637 --> 02:34:10,619
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the administrators said that they only received five.

719
02:34:13,655 --> 02:34:17,058
[SPEAKER_16]: alerts today for students that weren't where they needed to be.

720
02:34:17,638 --> 02:34:23,082
[SPEAKER_16]: So the improvement, it's like huge.

721
02:34:23,262 --> 02:34:24,643
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really significant.

722
02:34:24,883 --> 02:34:26,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the talking point just going to the parent, right?

723
02:34:27,247 --> 02:34:32,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the talking point is just like the parent receives a text.

724
02:34:32,311 --> 02:34:33,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it, yep, yep, yep.

725
02:34:33,531 --> 02:34:37,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so is that also going to the AP too?

726
02:34:38,395 --> 02:34:40,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it happening simultaneously?

727
02:34:41,217 --> 02:34:56,828
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the talking points message to my knowledge- What I'm saying is the AP being told that today, when you said Johnny, so Johnny didn't show up, his mom was notified, but was the assistant principal notified so that those four are still being counted towards the discipline

728
02:34:58,516 --> 02:35:02,621
[SPEAKER_16]: in house, I want to say that it has to be logged into school brains.

729
02:35:03,241 --> 02:35:07,546
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know, I might ask for that's correct.

730
02:35:08,087 --> 02:35:13,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Once it's logged in school brains, then that's when the administrators both parks.

731
02:35:15,575 --> 02:35:15,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

732
02:35:15,895 --> 02:35:16,656
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is yes.

733
02:35:16,877 --> 02:35:19,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, mom, you know this now.

734
02:35:20,543 --> 02:35:24,245
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, they log it in school brains, and then that's when the administrator will get.

735
02:35:24,626 --> 02:35:28,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just want to make sure that so the teacher is responsible to make sure both parties know now.

736
02:35:29,449 --> 02:35:36,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Once it's entered into school brains, the administrative all the administrators who work with the students can see that.

737
02:35:36,853 --> 02:35:37,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, perfect.

738
02:35:37,574 --> 02:35:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note, if I may.

739
02:35:39,435 --> 02:35:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, really, if you're done with that question.

740
02:35:43,377 --> 02:35:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: During the class meetings,

741
02:35:46,129 --> 02:35:54,271
[SPEAKER_07]: it was not clear on what the discipline would be, other than the first would be reported to your parent and potentially the assistant principal.

742
02:35:55,371 --> 02:36:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And the students in the listening sessions actually said, because it's going to be based per student.

743
02:36:02,373 --> 02:36:08,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the listening sessions, the students actually that came to the listening sessions wanted stricter discipline

744
02:36:09,557 --> 02:36:11,397
[SPEAKER_07]: to be known by the student body.

745
02:36:11,457 --> 02:36:18,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if there is a special situation of a child in an IEP, then you would treat them on a case by case basis.

746
02:36:19,379 --> 02:36:26,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do ask that the administration does work on a plan that's tight, that the student body would understand.

747
02:36:28,061 --> 02:36:31,982
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't happy their parents were going to be called to be notified, which is fine.

748
02:36:32,062 --> 02:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't want to even said, I feel like I might be discriminated against because it's a case by case basis.

749
02:36:38,644 --> 02:36:39,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do it.

750
02:36:39,528 --> 02:36:48,052
[SPEAKER_07]: ask the administration to have a team meeting on this to identify what the levels of discipline will be to then follow up with the student body.

751
02:36:48,152 --> 02:36:52,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if there's a special situation, then that will be handled accordingly.

752
02:36:53,294 --> 02:36:54,355
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's important.

753
02:36:54,395 --> 02:36:55,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're on the right track.

754
02:36:55,776 --> 02:37:04,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be report home every single time, but then discipline comes into play depending on how many times a class is cut.

755
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:05,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad it's working.

756
02:37:05,725 --> 02:37:15,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we need to just tighten it up and firm that up and let parents, caregivers, teachers, students know, because it will happen less and less if they know what the consequences are.

757
02:37:15,912 --> 02:37:16,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

758
02:37:16,693 --> 02:37:19,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be a team effort between home and school.

759
02:37:19,735 --> 02:37:30,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that maybe parents feeling even a little disconnected from that, because I know that when my child goes to school and I'm sure many parents feel the same way.

760
02:37:30,163 --> 02:37:32,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm expecting them to be in English right now.

761
02:37:32,731 --> 02:37:47,640
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then, you know, obviously when an emergency is happening at the school and you know that emergency response teams are there, you're thinking, okay, my child must be in math right now, not in a bathroom hanging out or in a hallway that no one's, you know, might be looking at regularly.

762
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:53,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that it's important that parents know where your child is during the day.

763
02:37:53,383 --> 02:38:02,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've said this, I think I've reached out to many of you saying that, you know, if there was just even a natural disaster, if you don't know where these students are, if they're supposed to be 30, you know, 30 kids in a class,

764
02:38:03,146 --> 02:38:06,009
[SPEAKER_04]: and eight have walking around, three didn't show up.

765
02:38:06,489 --> 02:38:12,094
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of responsibility for the teacher to say, I don't know where 11 kids are.

766
02:38:12,194 --> 02:38:14,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's great.

767
02:38:14,816 --> 02:38:16,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just have one more question.

768
02:38:16,838 --> 02:38:18,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was from member Hays.

769
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious when you did this new walkthrough, did you see a difference?

770
02:38:22,282 --> 02:38:23,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you walked through prior?

771
02:38:24,423 --> 02:38:30,130
[SPEAKER_19]: And did you see on separate walks or a lot, but, um, it was a pretty, it was a brief walkthrough, but yet there.

772
02:38:30,711 --> 02:38:33,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, first of all, the hallways were very quiet.

773
02:38:34,756 --> 02:38:38,040
[SPEAKER_19]: And there were, you know, a student who came out was going somewhere and

774
02:38:38,669 --> 02:38:42,933
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, the superintendent asked them where they were going and they were prepared with their response.

775
02:38:42,973 --> 02:38:44,294
[SPEAKER_19]: They knew they were going to have to respond.

776
02:38:44,954 --> 02:38:50,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we did get to talk to some staff, um, who were on, I think they're on their lunch break actually.

777
02:38:50,799 --> 02:39:00,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and they seemed very enthusiastic about the rules, the new procedures in place and said, you know, that they did have a few students who kind of grumbled about it.

778
02:39:00,067 --> 02:39:03,791
[SPEAKER_19]: And they said to them, you know, this is the way it is at most high schools.

779
02:39:03,891 --> 02:39:05,332
[SPEAKER_19]: So that we're not different.

780
02:39:05,816 --> 02:39:07,216
[SPEAKER_19]: This is important.

781
02:39:07,436 --> 02:39:12,718
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said, for the most part, this one staff person said, the students were responding well to it.

782
02:39:12,958 --> 02:39:13,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

783
02:39:13,238 --> 02:39:13,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

784
02:39:13,918 --> 02:39:14,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

785
02:39:15,099 --> 02:39:15,719
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, so good.

786
02:39:15,839 --> 02:39:16,079
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

787
02:39:16,239 --> 02:39:16,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

788
02:39:16,499 --> 02:39:17,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, guys.

789
02:39:18,059 --> 02:39:18,440
Thank you.

790
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:19,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

791
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:20,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Braley.

792
02:39:22,561 --> 02:39:23,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

793
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:27,182
[SPEAKER_11]: The third button.

794
02:39:27,222 --> 02:39:28,142
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

795
02:39:34,879 --> 02:39:37,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Number eight, you said there was a gentleman, Michael Welch.

796
02:39:40,885 --> 02:39:48,052
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's important to, so is he being, is it voluntary or is he being paid?

797
02:39:49,394 --> 02:39:49,954
[SPEAKER_13]: He's being paid.

798
02:39:50,335 --> 02:39:56,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's also important that, as a taxpayer, that, how did you find Mr. Welch?

799
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:25,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I notified the Massachusetts Association of school superintendents, and I spoke with me SS and I asked them for a recommendation of a retired superintendent or retired administrator, who would like to come and be a neutral consult to come and look at Medford High School, and look at our systems our structures and see where we are to help us.

800
02:40:26,124 --> 02:40:40,622
[SPEAKER_16]: turn things around to get it to where we want it to be to ensure safety and stability at the high school because sometimes when you're, I keep thinking of the for breeze commercial that you can become nose blind to something, because you're just used to it.

801
02:40:41,082 --> 02:40:44,607
[SPEAKER_16]: And so by bringing in someone who's neutral who has not been in the district,

802
02:40:45,027 --> 02:40:47,789
[SPEAKER_16]: They can come in and say, oh, this is something that I see.

803
02:40:48,309 --> 02:40:49,970
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a best practice.

804
02:40:50,330 --> 02:40:52,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep maintaining this particular thing.

805
02:40:52,271 --> 02:40:56,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And oh, this is something where you can make an adjustment.

806
02:40:56,833 --> 02:41:01,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And it'll work much better or much more smoother.

807
02:41:01,195 --> 02:41:03,196
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what it was.

808
02:41:03,557 --> 02:41:12,321
[SPEAKER_13]: My only concern was because his name rang a bell because he was just, I'm sure you would know, he was involved in a civil rights lawsuit.

809
02:41:12,748 --> 02:41:14,609
[SPEAKER_13]: last August through the school that I'm lost.

810
02:41:14,629 --> 02:41:16,831
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was just curious how this all came together.

811
02:41:17,431 --> 02:41:18,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

812
02:41:19,172 --> 02:41:19,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

813
02:41:19,493 --> 02:41:24,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just curious because I just remember the equity process that company that some of the employees that were with them.

814
02:41:24,696 --> 02:41:29,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious how we, we came about choosing him as a taxpayer.

815
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:31,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And if he's going to be involved in our schools,

816
02:41:32,801 --> 02:41:33,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, he is.

817
02:41:33,522 --> 02:41:37,324
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's highly recommended by Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents.

818
02:41:37,384 --> 02:41:39,445
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's where I got my consult.

819
02:41:39,545 --> 02:41:53,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've been very pleased with his support thus far in helping us to give us feedback and help us to just gather our information and really put our best foot forward.

820
02:41:54,874 --> 02:41:55,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

821
02:41:56,976 --> 02:41:59,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Gilead.

822
02:41:59,057 --> 02:42:00,838
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a number four recommendation

823
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:06,061
[SPEAKER_07]: to approve district consultant contract, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent superintendent.

824
02:42:07,741 --> 02:42:09,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.

825
02:42:09,542 --> 02:42:15,343
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to ask Mr. retired superintendent Mr. Welch to come forward as well.

826
02:42:15,543 --> 02:42:16,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Michael Welch, thank you.

827
02:42:18,563 --> 02:42:25,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Welch comes highly recommended from MASS he has come to support us and

828
02:42:26,405 --> 02:42:30,888
[SPEAKER_16]: conduct interviews observe provide feedback expertise.

829
02:42:31,508 --> 02:42:49,299
[SPEAKER_16]: He has over brings over 15 years of principal experience at both Newton South and Framingham High School, large high schools within the Commonwealth, and just completed nine years as superintendent in dead and public schools.

830
02:42:49,839 --> 02:42:53,242
[SPEAKER_16]: So Mr. Welch, would you like to speak please?

831
02:42:53,582 --> 02:42:53,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

832
02:42:54,485 --> 02:42:58,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and thank you Madam Mayor for having me here this evening and it's been my pleasure to be a part of.

833
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:06,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting to know the Medford Public Schools, as the superintendent mentioned, she and I did not know each other prior to a week ago.

834
02:43:06,666 --> 02:43:09,248
[SPEAKER_01]: My intended retirement date was December 23rd.

835
02:43:10,309 --> 02:43:16,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a call, I believe it was on December 21st, asking if I'd be interested in speaking with the superintendent.

836
02:43:17,014 --> 02:43:19,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went home and my wife thought I was nuts.

837
02:43:20,257 --> 02:43:22,218
[SPEAKER_01]: She expects me to be sitting on the couch right now.

838
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:28,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I felt very compelled by the situation that you were in.

839
02:43:28,503 --> 02:43:40,689
[SPEAKER_01]: As a high school principal and framing him a very, very large 2200 student suburban but urban high school, I had a student stabbed on the front steps of the school and he came in the school and I caught him as he was collapsing.

840
02:43:41,409 --> 02:43:48,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that the med flight helicopter landed on the football field in front of the school during dismissal while 37 buses were trying to leave.

841
02:43:49,113 --> 02:43:50,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been where the district is.

842
02:43:51,095 --> 02:43:52,876
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very difficult place to be.

843
02:43:53,557 --> 02:44:05,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a desire in situations like this to make very quick reactions to situations to immediately change everything about the way the school functions to prevent that from ever happening again.

844
02:44:05,626 --> 02:44:07,008
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is it's not that easy.

845
02:44:07,648 --> 02:44:14,012
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many, many reasons that contribute to why things happen, not all that you can control, but that you have to understand.

846
02:44:14,172 --> 02:44:15,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see my role right now.

847
02:44:16,254 --> 02:44:36,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent the last few days having intensive interviews with folks both at the central office and with the leadership team, with the principals, with the assistant principals, with the folks that are overseeing the central office to make sure you need to understand what's going on before you can propose any sort of recommendation, because a quick fix

848
02:44:37,239 --> 02:44:38,420
[SPEAKER_01]: invariably is not going to do it.

849
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:42,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So my goal is to make sure that we're prioritizing school safety and security.

850
02:44:42,581 --> 02:44:43,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm another set of eyes.

851
02:44:43,502 --> 02:44:48,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in seven different secondary schools in five different public school districts over the past 34 years.

852
02:44:48,984 --> 02:44:50,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to provide recommendations.

853
02:44:50,544 --> 02:44:52,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no magic wand.

854
02:44:52,565 --> 02:44:54,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no ability to make decisions.

855
02:44:55,366 --> 02:45:01,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I am simply here to provide my recommendation and I'm here at the request of the superintendent and

856
02:45:02,089 --> 02:45:06,914
[SPEAKER_01]: on her good graces, and I've been tremendously impressed with the work that I've seen so far.

857
02:45:07,294 --> 02:45:11,238
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cavernous facility, and there are so many different pieces that go into this.

858
02:45:11,839 --> 02:45:17,083
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things like the building structure of the size, the square footage, how it's situated.

859
02:45:17,164 --> 02:45:17,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three floors.

860
02:45:18,405 --> 02:45:19,145
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.

861
02:45:19,245 --> 02:45:19,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cavernous.

862
02:45:20,246 --> 02:45:22,308
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many different programs that are a part of the school.

863
02:45:22,989 --> 02:45:24,530
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of security is in place?

864
02:45:24,550 --> 02:45:24,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have

865
02:45:25,498 --> 02:45:42,963
[SPEAKER_01]: school cameras do we have building monitors do we have duties for teachers, what sort of processes and procedures are people following what are the routines that have been a part of the culture and climate of the building, what kind of staffing do we have what sort of personnel are we looking at what do we need, what do we have that maybe isn't working what is working.

866
02:45:43,647 --> 02:45:47,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that based on personality and talent or is it based on structure.

867
02:45:47,790 --> 02:46:02,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not clear to me at all where we are with that, what kind of schedules do we have, how is the drop off and pick up going, where do kids go, who are their best contacts who do they trust what sort of student voice is involved with making the school run.

868
02:46:03,102 --> 02:46:04,363
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we communicate?

869
02:46:04,483 --> 02:46:05,643
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we communicate with homes?

870
02:46:05,683 --> 02:46:06,944
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we communicate with students?

871
02:46:07,264 --> 02:46:08,544
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we communicate with staff?

872
02:46:08,924 --> 02:46:10,505
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we organize all of that?

873
02:46:10,645 --> 02:46:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And the routines and structure are all interconnected.

874
02:46:14,887 --> 02:46:15,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So again,

875
02:46:16,039 --> 02:46:18,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here at the request of the superintendent.

876
02:46:18,361 --> 02:46:20,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm perfectly happy to go home on the couch again.

877
02:46:20,763 --> 02:46:27,729
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, this is a tremendous, intriguing situation that is exactly in my wheelhouse of what I've dealt with.

878
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:37,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if you go home and Google my name to the speaker's comments, there are many instances that I've been involved in as a school superintendent, which were very hard decisions.

879
02:46:37,618 --> 02:46:40,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And often those aren't met necessarily with unanimous applause.

880
02:46:41,223 --> 02:46:43,525
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes the right thing to do is the hard thing to do.

881
02:46:44,105 --> 02:46:46,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we may be in one of those instances now.

882
02:46:47,168 --> 02:46:52,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about the way the Medford Public Schools works and who is involved and where things are.

883
02:46:52,793 --> 02:46:59,239
[SPEAKER_01]: But my intention is if you should prefer to have me here, I will be more than happy to give you my recommendations moving forward.

884
02:46:59,419 --> 02:47:04,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And my expectation is, should you choose to move forward, is to meet individually with every one of you.

885
02:47:05,704 --> 02:47:08,947
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal as a superintendent in Dedham was to meet with every high school senior

886
02:47:09,817 --> 02:47:14,641
[SPEAKER_01]: in their senior year before they graduated to make sure I understood what kids' experiences were.

887
02:47:15,121 --> 02:47:21,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to be able to do that with all of you and make sure that all of these are ingredients that are critical to where we go as a district.

888
02:47:21,746 --> 02:47:24,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

889
02:47:27,790 --> 02:47:28,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

890
02:47:29,091 --> 02:47:31,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
02:47:31,073 --> 02:47:38,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had some questions or some suggestions to make the contract a little bit more clear.

892
02:47:39,435 --> 02:47:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so in the, um, in the contract, it talks about your final report.

893
02:47:46,218 --> 02:47:49,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want a couple of things about that final report.

894
02:47:49,999 --> 02:47:51,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like it to explicitly.

895
02:47:51,840 --> 02:48:07,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, request that you will, in addition to making recommendations that you will provide us your recommendation on the timeline and the implementation plan that it would take to actually do the things that you're going to outline, because.

896
02:48:08,198 --> 02:48:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a consultant myself.

897
02:48:10,719 --> 02:48:24,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just give somebody a report and they put it on a shelf, they've wasted, they've wasted their money, and I want to make sure that we are reacting to what you're saying we're prioritizing those expenditures if there are any.

898
02:48:25,517 --> 02:48:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we have the community has a marker of like what this timeline is because you're right like there's a lot of there's a lot of urgency in the immediate.

899
02:48:38,989 --> 02:48:43,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Moments that gets reacted to, but none of it is sustainable.

900
02:48:44,014 --> 02:48:51,160
[SPEAKER_02]: That, like the immediate response is just like inherently never going to be sustainable and so in order.

901
02:48:51,929 --> 02:49:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: for the climate and the culture of the building and our school to change like that sustainability has to come like to priority for us and so I'd like to see that be an explicit part of.

902
02:49:04,605 --> 02:49:05,365
[SPEAKER_02]: the deliverable.

903
02:49:06,306 --> 02:49:22,610
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I would ask about the final deliverable is that the language state that you will also provide us a draft and provide us individually opportunity to give you feedback before the final report is just issued to us.

904
02:49:23,191 --> 02:49:29,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think we will want to know and we'll have questions.

905
02:49:29,232 --> 02:49:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I don't want to just get a report that

906
02:49:31,872 --> 02:49:37,707
[SPEAKER_02]: could have really been actionable for us, but it left something out that we think is really important.

907
02:49:37,867 --> 02:49:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the other.

908
02:49:41,114 --> 02:49:42,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

909
02:49:42,555 --> 02:49:51,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess I just wanted to sort of like describe the changes that I'm looking for and find out like how you want to proceed.

910
02:49:51,458 --> 02:50:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other question that I had is this has an end date of February 28th and my question for you is whether all of this can reasonably and realistically be done by February 28th because II think, you know, these kinds of things take

911
02:50:07,455 --> 02:50:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: time.

912
02:50:08,636 --> 02:50:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, everybody's doing their day job, everybody's operating the school and all these things.

913
02:50:13,798 --> 02:50:31,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So just the pure access to the people that you need, I think my question to you, and I totally defer to your judgment, is whether February 28 is the right date, or if there needs to be some sort of flexibility, like clause in the contract that allows that to continue, if necessary.

914
02:50:32,786 --> 02:50:34,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, those are like the three things that

915
02:50:35,826 --> 02:50:38,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I would either suggest I'm happy to make a motion.

916
02:50:38,068 --> 02:50:46,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know if you are looking for us to approve this contract or just make the changes.

917
02:50:46,255 --> 02:50:49,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So more question to you about how you want to proceed.

918
02:50:49,833 --> 02:50:54,294
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I was just jotting down some notes based on what you were saying.

919
02:50:54,374 --> 02:51:07,938
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can definitely go back to the contract to make those revisions and then send it back to you, the committee, to see if I can highlight the areas so you can see if I captured what it was that you were saying properly.

920
02:51:07,958 --> 02:51:16,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

921
02:51:17,581 --> 02:51:17,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

922
02:51:17,881 --> 02:51:39,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to ask if it can be included that there'll be interpretation services provided to that you're doing, if you haven't already thought of this, obviously, but that it's explicit that you will be having these focus groups or some of the discussions with individuals who may need interpretation services and that that will be provided.

923
02:51:40,012 --> 02:51:42,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And that not only that it may happen, but that it will happen.

924
02:51:44,735 --> 02:51:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Eby?

925
02:51:46,502 --> 02:51:47,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I can definitely do that.

926
02:51:48,743 --> 02:52:02,849
[SPEAKER_16]: We can schedule it, it's, it's part of getting feedback from parents and the community and students so we will include all stakeholders mask question from the chair.

927
02:52:02,929 --> 02:52:05,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, do you have more questions.

928
02:52:07,051 --> 02:52:12,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think the first paragraph is, is somewhat lacking.

929
02:52:13,735 --> 02:52:34,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe some of the additions that Member Graham suggested will cut it, but I just feel like review of policies and procedures and also review of past practice of how we heard a lot over the last several weeks, just bullying complaints that were not followed up on, racism in a classroom that was not followed up on.

930
02:52:34,815 --> 02:52:36,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's great that

931
02:52:37,932 --> 02:52:50,358
[SPEAKER_07]: to have somebody to speak to all administrative staff, especially our central administration, who seems to know, along with our superintendent, the day-to-day and what's gone on over the last several years.

932
02:52:51,478 --> 02:52:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that the school committee is part of those discussions or at least gets an interview as well.

933
02:52:57,221 --> 02:53:06,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But accountability, follow-up, how are we handling progressive discipline and review of policies and procedures are also very important.

934
02:53:08,134 --> 02:53:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess my question is, how did we come to, I think along the same lines, how did we come to the February 28th date and that amount of money?

935
02:53:17,998 --> 02:53:21,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there any discussions of additional funding?

936
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:27,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I think we're going to go through the RFP process and do a culture and climate study.

937
02:53:27,743 --> 02:53:30,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We just hired somebody for communications.

938
02:53:30,644 --> 02:53:32,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a lot.

939
02:53:32,125 --> 02:53:35,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And my follow up question would be, how are we going to pay?

940
02:53:35,731 --> 02:53:38,153
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we're gonna be using ESSER money or how we're gonna pay for all this.

941
02:53:38,594 --> 02:53:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this what the terms have been, the $25,500 for two full months?

942
02:53:41,036 --> 02:53:42,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Has that always been on the table?

943
02:53:49,085 --> 02:54:05,075
[SPEAKER_16]: So with the two months, we came up with the two month timeframe to see how long we thought it would take for Mr. Welch to be able to gather all the information that we had and we did not want it to be something that was going to be, you know,

944
02:54:06,096 --> 02:54:09,278
[SPEAKER_16]: so spread out that you weren't able to do something actionable.

945
02:54:10,719 --> 02:54:19,785
[SPEAKER_16]: So I definitely am willing to be flexible with the amount of time and extend the time and we could... Sorry to interrupt.

946
02:54:19,805 --> 02:54:20,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not my question.

947
02:54:20,986 --> 02:54:24,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather not extend the time in the contract if it was up to just me.

948
02:54:24,488 --> 02:54:27,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just asking, how did we come up with the two months?

949
02:54:27,770 --> 02:54:35,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that two months, the 25,000, what we've always been discussed, which has always been discussed, or how did we get to that figure?

950
02:54:35,751 --> 02:54:36,492
[SPEAKER_11]: in that time frame.

951
02:54:41,376 --> 02:54:48,963
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the, that's the amount based on the consultant fee based on the two months of work.

952
02:54:50,084 --> 02:54:53,967
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's how we got to that number saying how long did we think it would take.

953
02:54:55,608 --> 02:54:59,752
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were, we would be using SR funding and.

954
02:55:03,004 --> 02:55:05,985
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I'm open.

955
02:55:07,226 --> 02:55:16,069
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have gone longer, but I didn't wanna go overboard also knowing that we needed information, we needed the guidance.

956
02:55:16,769 --> 02:55:22,091
[SPEAKER_16]: MASS, he was the first one that was recommended.

957
02:55:22,171 --> 02:55:24,872
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what helped to make the decision for me.

958
02:55:26,932 --> 02:55:27,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

959
02:55:28,933 --> 02:55:30,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays, Member McLaughlin, Member Graham.

960
02:55:32,396 --> 02:55:34,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just wondering what the consultant thinks.

961
02:55:35,158 --> 02:55:41,642
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I think I would assume you had conversations about the scope of work and what you felt was a reasonable time.

962
02:55:41,702 --> 02:55:46,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have any input that you want to give it to this conversation or if I may, madam chair?

963
02:55:46,505 --> 02:55:52,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we had a considerable conversation and again, looking at how to frame the scope of work.

964
02:55:52,788 --> 02:55:58,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that it's thorough because I don't want to have a misinterpretation on any one person.

965
02:55:59,008 --> 02:56:09,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You typically, as a consultant, you're looking for three different sources of information to confirm independently what you're believing, and I wanna make sure I have time for that, but at the same time, these are taxpayer dollars.

966
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:21,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that everything has to be justified, and I'm gonna work very hard to be able to provide this as quickly as possible, yet at the same time, I'm not sure if this is adequate or more than necessary.

967
02:56:21,973 --> 02:56:26,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, my goal is to try to complete the bulk of the work in a consistent and

968
02:56:27,145 --> 02:56:37,428
[SPEAKER_01]: constrained timeframe that was mentioned here, and then that would allow for plenty of time in the rest of the school year to be looking at implementation strategies moving forward.

969
02:56:38,048 --> 02:56:42,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer, I'm not sure if it's enough, but I believe it will be.

970
02:56:43,149 --> 02:56:43,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

971
02:56:44,310 --> 02:56:45,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham.

972
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and just to the point of the consultation and the focus groups as well, I think that a lot of times we're framing some of the,

973
02:56:54,423 --> 02:57:07,750
[SPEAKER_06]: instances, and particularly in the last few that we've seen, obviously, as student on student, but it's clear, obviously, I know that you understand as a superintendent, the bullying statute and the laws around that, that it could be anybody.

974
02:57:09,071 --> 02:57:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll share that and you'll explore that with the focus groups?

975
02:57:12,792 --> 02:57:13,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.

976
02:57:13,633 --> 02:57:19,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, part of this is me learning all of these different players and all of the different pieces, all of the different cultures,

977
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:22,851
[SPEAKER_01]: the collective bargaining agreements, the constraints that are in the system.

978
02:57:23,151 --> 02:57:35,759
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different pieces to this, but my expectation is to work very hard and do this in a expeditious manner so it doesn't just drag out forever, because I want to be able to provide significant value for what you're asking for.

979
02:57:37,821 --> 02:57:39,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham and then Member Ruseau.

980
02:57:41,883 --> 02:57:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to make a motion to approve as amended, but maybe we should let Member Ruseau speak first.

981
02:57:49,818 --> 02:57:50,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau.

982
02:57:52,120 --> 02:57:52,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

983
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:56,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question about number six, intellectual property.

984
02:57:56,022 --> 02:58:13,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I read it as the written reports essentially are ours, but I'm just wondering about interview notes, for instance, like, will those be ours?

985
02:58:13,173 --> 02:58:16,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that I like yes or no, because if the answer is yes,

986
02:58:17,264 --> 02:58:22,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like that will limit what people are willing to say if they know that it can just all be read.

987
02:58:23,328 --> 02:58:30,211
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other hand, what happens to that information if it is not given to us is my question.

988
02:58:36,815 --> 02:58:38,796
[SPEAKER_11]: We can check with our legal team, Member Ruseau.

989
02:58:38,937 --> 02:58:41,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the correct answer myself.

990
02:58:42,979 --> 02:58:44,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, but sorry.

991
02:58:45,812 --> 02:58:54,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess what I mean, but I do think that Mr. Welch will, like, does he plan to keep these things?

992
02:58:54,199 --> 02:58:56,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he have a data retention policy?

993
02:58:56,060 --> 02:59:03,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, if you're interviewing people and you want some real honest responses, it's good for people to know the life cycle of what they tell you.

994
02:59:05,208 --> 02:59:25,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's really my question and concern is people need to know that if there's notes being written, and then anybody can do a public records request and read what I said, or anybody in the administration or anybody else could read said in an interview, I think that changes the kinds of responses you're going to get.

995
02:59:27,959 --> 02:59:28,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

996
02:59:29,735 --> 02:59:31,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

997
02:59:32,556 --> 02:59:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make a motion to approve this as amended with the following amendments.

998
02:59:37,957 --> 02:59:50,441
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that the recommendations explicitly include an implementation plan and a timeline, and that school committee feedback will be incorporated before the final report is delivered.

999
02:59:53,442 --> 02:59:57,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to that, the intellectual property

1000
02:59:58,854 --> 03:00:07,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Section will be amended to explicitly state that interview notes will not be shared with the district.

1001
03:00:08,163 --> 03:00:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be destroyed within 60 days after the conclusion of the contract, but that the final report will provide a summary of interviews for posterity.

1002
03:00:21,328 --> 03:00:26,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a way, because I don't think you should share your interview notes with us.

1003
03:00:26,152 --> 03:00:32,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'll get the kind of feedback that we need you to have in order to provide us good solid feedback.

1004
03:00:32,476 --> 03:00:45,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it makes sense to be explicit about the destruction of those notes and that instead, and in lieu of like turning over all of those work notes that you would just provide a summary as part of that appendix to the report.

1005
03:00:48,468 --> 03:00:49,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

1006
03:00:49,761 --> 03:01:01,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to make a amendment to the motion or proposed amendment to the motion that all subgroups will be included and interpretation services will be provided for any subgroups needed.

1007
03:01:03,505 --> 03:01:04,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

1008
03:01:04,145 --> 03:01:04,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgot that one.

1009
03:01:06,345 --> 03:01:16,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I could, from the chair, otherwise I could take the floor, just that we also include review of policies and procedures, past practices of things like the bullying and the racism, that accountability be

1010
03:01:17,822 --> 03:01:19,982
[SPEAKER_07]: looked into follow-up progressive discipline.

1011
03:01:20,003 --> 03:01:22,123
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1012
03:01:23,303 --> 03:01:25,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve as amended.

1013
03:01:25,744 --> 03:01:29,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve as amended by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1014
03:01:30,105 --> 03:01:30,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote.

1015
03:01:32,285 --> 03:01:32,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

1016
03:01:34,025 --> 03:01:34,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1017
03:01:35,646 --> 03:01:37,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

1018
03:01:38,186 --> 03:01:38,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1019
03:01:39,327 --> 03:01:39,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz?

1020
03:01:41,047 --> 03:01:41,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1021
03:01:42,187 --> 03:01:43,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1022
03:01:44,468 --> 03:01:44,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1023
03:01:45,608 --> 03:01:46,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mestone?

1024
03:01:48,976 --> 03:01:50,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau Yes, Mayor logo.

1025
03:01:55,882 --> 03:01:57,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Your microphone is not on there.

1026
03:01:57,604 --> 03:02:06,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Well, motion passes some MSBA status and fiscal year 23 budget Mr. David Murphy assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

1027
03:02:07,253 --> 03:02:07,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Murphy.

1028
03:02:19,790 --> 03:02:20,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

1029
03:02:20,570 --> 03:02:21,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, members of the school committee.

1030
03:02:22,751 --> 03:02:28,012
[SPEAKER_12]: As the mayor said, I'm going to be providing you with a two-part update this evening.

1031
03:02:28,872 --> 03:02:42,815
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is a continuation of a discussion that we had several times throughout calendar year 2022 related to the district's statement of interest as submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

1032
03:02:43,630 --> 03:02:55,723
[SPEAKER_12]: In April of 2022 for a project focused on our flagship school Medford High School, and then I will be providing really our first.

1033
03:02:59,312 --> 03:03:03,554
[SPEAKER_12]: budget update since the adoption of the FY 23 budget.

1034
03:03:03,614 --> 03:03:19,501
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you know, in lieu of the quarterly updates that I've typically provided to you, we've discussed on many, many occasions, the development of our collective bargaining agreements, which as you know, is the main driver of our operational budget.

1035
03:03:20,245 --> 03:03:21,786
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm turning first to the MSBA.

1036
03:03:22,406 --> 03:03:46,275
[SPEAKER_12]: As the committee is aware, our statement of interest into the Medford High School project advanced initially to the sort of unofficial stage of the senior study visit with representatives from the MSBA visiting Medford High School, touring Medford High School along with school officials and the mayor, representatives from the city.

1037
03:03:47,535 --> 03:03:49,697
[SPEAKER_12]: That occurred in October of 2022.

1038
03:03:49,897 --> 03:04:01,246
[SPEAKER_12]: The next step in that process would have been, and we had hoped that it would be an invitation into the feasibility phase of their of their pipeline.

1039
03:04:01,627 --> 03:04:03,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, we learned in.

1040
03:04:04,689 --> 03:04:10,432
[SPEAKER_12]: early December that we would not be advancing into that next phase for this year.

1041
03:04:11,353 --> 03:04:25,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said to the committee when communicating about that, while that is obviously disappointing and not what we had hoped when we submitted our statement of interest in April of 2022 for a project, the scope of which had not been determined.

1042
03:04:27,433 --> 03:04:33,794
[SPEAKER_12]: The messaging that came from the MSBA, I think, was generally encouraging.

1043
03:04:34,374 --> 03:04:52,278
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm making that statement publicly both because it's accurate and I can walk through to some degree of specificity why I think it was encouraging, but also because one of the things that we experienced as a leadership team, and I imagine members of the committee did as well,

1044
03:04:52,762 --> 03:05:00,543
[SPEAKER_12]: that in the preparation of that statement of interest, which is for those who have been following along with the sort of blow by blow, I don't remember back to April.

1045
03:05:01,136 --> 03:05:07,841
[SPEAKER_12]: statement of interest is essentially an application to what the MSBA refers to as their core project program.

1046
03:05:08,262 --> 03:05:28,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's a program that goes beyond the limited scope of windows, boilers, and roofs that the accelerated repair program focuses on and is potentially a much broader project, a much more in-depth project, leading either to the extensive rehabilitation of the building or potentially a new building.

1047
03:05:29,170 --> 03:05:31,592
[SPEAKER_12]: So we applied for the core program in April.

1048
03:05:32,413 --> 03:05:36,056
[SPEAKER_12]: We advanced to essentially the top 50%.

1049
03:05:36,356 --> 03:05:40,160
[SPEAKER_12]: They had about somewhere between 45 and 50 applications.

1050
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:43,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, they refer to those as SOIs or statements of interest.

1051
03:05:44,163 --> 03:05:48,927
[SPEAKER_12]: There were 25 projects across the Commonwealth that received the senior study visit.

1052
03:05:49,648 --> 03:05:50,429
[SPEAKER_12]: We were one of those 25.

1053
03:05:52,150 --> 03:05:53,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, the MSBA invited

1054
03:05:54,961 --> 03:06:03,595
[SPEAKER_12]: excuse me, 10 projects, 10 statements of interest from different districts across the state into the feasibility period.

1055
03:06:05,421 --> 03:06:09,524
[SPEAKER_12]: The way they break the system down is into tiers of the applications down into tiers.

1056
03:06:10,845 --> 03:06:24,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know that we were in this the second tier which put us somewhere in the top 14 that's about us and I frankly I don't really know whether that may be slightly more specificity than I'm supposed to provide to you, but for purposes of retaining a degree of hope that.

1057
03:06:25,537 --> 03:06:27,759
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that we can continue to advocate for.

1058
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:33,584
[SPEAKER_12]: And as the MSBA explicitly recommended resubmit our statement of interest next year.

1059
03:06:34,545 --> 03:06:43,832
[SPEAKER_12]: On average, they've accepted about 17 projects so in a in what would be considered a typical year with the typical budgetary allocation of projects.

1060
03:06:44,933 --> 03:06:49,816
[SPEAKER_12]: we would have made it within that threshold, at least as was reported back to us.

1061
03:06:50,476 --> 03:06:56,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's been, it was, I think we submitted a strong statement of interest.

1062
03:06:56,499 --> 03:07:08,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was, that assertion is substantiated by the feedback that we received from the MSBA and the strong encouragement that we received to resubmit.

1063
03:07:08,625 --> 03:07:13,287
[SPEAKER_12]: When the eligibility period reopens, which will happen within the next couple of weeks,

1064
03:07:13,707 --> 03:07:19,313
[SPEAKER_12]: It will close in mid-April, and then the process will start again, and they will go through their step-by-step process.

1065
03:07:19,613 --> 03:07:24,618
[SPEAKER_12]: And the hope is that we will receive a senior study visit in calendar year 2023.

1066
03:07:25,459 --> 03:07:28,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where we are with regard to that.

1067
03:07:28,662 --> 03:07:36,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Just very briefly, the reason that we're reporting on this publicly is one of the experiences that our team had in preparing the statement of interest was

1068
03:07:37,769 --> 03:07:44,852
[SPEAKER_12]: pushing back on what amounts to either inaccurate information or misinformation in some cases.

1069
03:07:44,972 --> 03:07:58,937
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the suggestion that somehow due to previous, excuse me, characterizations or responses from the MSBA, that the district's fate with respect to this type of application or project is already determined.

1070
03:07:59,757 --> 03:08:04,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I can say that that was very clearly not the case in our conversations with MSBA.

1071
03:08:05,299 --> 03:08:06,160
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would,

1072
03:08:07,854 --> 03:08:18,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be very important for the for the for the school committee and ultimately for the municipal council as well to to strongly strongly consider reapplying to the core program.

1073
03:08:19,003 --> 03:08:30,032
[SPEAKER_12]: This this time around, because obviously variables change and other conditions and other districts can deteriorate so we there are no guarantees there's no question about that but generally speaking.

1074
03:08:31,007 --> 03:08:32,628
[SPEAKER_12]: we were in a pretty strong position.

1075
03:08:32,668 --> 03:08:34,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll just say one last anecdote.

1076
03:08:35,068 --> 03:08:46,052
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the pieces of guidance that we received was that while there may be nothing specific that we should change within our SOI this year, they did make it very clear that we should supplement that with additional information.

1077
03:08:46,092 --> 03:08:49,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think while safety was a component of our application,

1078
03:08:50,373 --> 03:08:59,016
[SPEAKER_12]: given the extensive conversations we have had and have been referenced tonight about the inherent challenges that the infrastructure in our high school present.

1079
03:08:59,456 --> 03:09:07,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are all things that we can look to magnify to a greater degree as we supplement the SOI and hopefully it's resubmission.

1080
03:09:07,778 --> 03:09:10,719
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where we are with respect to the MSBA.

1081
03:09:11,219 --> 03:09:14,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And if anyone has any questions, I'm happy to try to answer them.

1082
03:09:16,001 --> 03:09:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1083
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:18,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1084
03:09:18,851 --> 03:09:22,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two questions, a couple questions.

1085
03:09:24,798 --> 03:09:33,349
[SPEAKER_02]: From the time that the MSBA accepts somebody into a feasibility study to the time where there's a shovel in the ground, how many years is that?

1086
03:09:34,088 --> 03:09:43,835
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly measured in years, but how many years really depends on the specifics, to some degree, specific choices that communities make.

1087
03:09:44,655 --> 03:09:49,178
[SPEAKER_12]: It obviously would depend on the scope of the project, the level of need.

1088
03:09:49,338 --> 03:09:54,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would imagine in certain years, depending on just the level of funding that's available.

1089
03:09:54,962 --> 03:09:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think the closest I can say to answering that question is that it's definitely measured in years.

1090
03:10:00,886 --> 03:10:03,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And my second question- Just to be clear, it's not measured in decades.

1091
03:10:04,758 --> 03:10:12,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself, which I say that I say that sort of half joking, but the one thing I would say is we're talking about a 50 year challenge, right?

1092
03:10:13,146 --> 03:10:14,747
[SPEAKER_12]: These buildings are meant to last 50 years.

1093
03:10:14,887 --> 03:10:17,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Ours has sort of lasted 50 years.

1094
03:10:18,511 --> 03:10:21,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Some would say that maybe it hasn't completely lasted, but it still stands.

1095
03:10:21,654 --> 03:10:22,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Kids will be there tomorrow.

1096
03:10:22,955 --> 03:10:24,436
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been in existence for 50 years.

1097
03:10:24,476 --> 03:10:27,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know whether or not we're going to get to the next step.

1098
03:10:27,819 --> 03:10:33,741
[SPEAKER_12]: next year, and we're going to start that clock of what could be two years, what could be three years, what could be four years.

1099
03:10:34,381 --> 03:10:44,784
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know that when we're talking about challenges that are measured in decades, the fact that we're as close as we are now for something that could be measured in years, I think is encouraging.

1100
03:10:49,245 --> 03:10:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, but I also look at all the students who are going to graduate from Medford High in its current state,

1101
03:10:58,257 --> 03:11:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: including probably every kid in our middle schools right now.

1102
03:11:01,339 --> 03:11:05,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not feeling terribly encouraged by that.

1103
03:11:06,462 --> 03:11:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the challenge.

1104
03:11:08,804 --> 03:11:27,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my question is, what else can we do as a community so that we are not looking at an entire generation of students either graduating from the current high school in its current state or surviving like a construction project essentially.

1105
03:11:28,361 --> 03:11:28,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I can we do?

1106
03:11:29,142 --> 03:11:30,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think I think that's a fair question.

1107
03:11:30,963 --> 03:11:33,585
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm in order to respond.

1108
03:11:33,605 --> 03:11:34,646
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to be clear.

1109
03:11:34,806 --> 03:11:47,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm responding not as the representative of the district who has had extensive conversations with the MSBA, but as an individual who sat where you did in a community who faced very similar issues and this year opened a, um, uh,

1110
03:11:49,775 --> 03:11:53,879
[SPEAKER_12]: what I think could be described as a fairly stunning new flagship school this fall.

1111
03:11:54,719 --> 03:12:13,295
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the things that you have to think about is, frankly, and I say this with all due respect to every elected official in the community here and in other bodies, there needs to be evidence of unity, there needs to be evidence of political will,

1112
03:12:14,218 --> 03:12:18,300
[SPEAKER_12]: and there needs to be a scarcity of evidence of political squabbling.

1113
03:12:18,920 --> 03:12:26,364
[SPEAKER_12]: And I say that because for every community, this is a difficult decision to grapple with.

1114
03:12:27,005 --> 03:12:29,266
[SPEAKER_12]: It is an expensive decision to grapple with.

1115
03:12:29,826 --> 03:12:40,892
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is one that people who genuinely care about students and the interests of education will feel differently about in terms of the specifics of the plan that ultimately moves forward.

1116
03:12:41,612 --> 03:12:43,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And despite those differences,

1117
03:12:44,890 --> 03:13:09,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe there is a significant amount of evidence that the communities that are successful in this plight are the ones that are able to, when they disagree, to disagree respectfully and to ultimately move forward with as united a front as the community can so that the agencies that are making these types of determinations, as in whether they shall allocate funding for municipalities across the Commonwealth,

1118
03:13:09,963 --> 03:13:14,586
[SPEAKER_12]: they have to have a degree of confidence that this is a project that will be successful.

1119
03:13:15,146 --> 03:13:28,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the way to instill that confidence is to demonstrate that we as a Medford community are prepared to accept and to spend wisely other communities' money, which is ultimately what needs to happen in these projects.

1120
03:13:31,316 --> 03:13:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1121
03:13:32,757 --> 03:13:37,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make a motion that we prepare to resubmit a statement of interest

1122
03:13:39,147 --> 03:13:40,428
[SPEAKER_02]: in this upcoming round.

1123
03:13:41,649 --> 03:13:42,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1124
03:13:44,050 --> 03:13:45,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, I'd like to make an amendment.

1125
03:13:47,072 --> 03:13:47,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

1126
03:13:49,213 --> 03:13:55,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to amend that to say that this will be done

1127
03:13:58,740 --> 03:14:05,892
[SPEAKER_09]: within 30 days, because my understanding is the process has changed for the upcoming submission that we will have to do.

1128
03:14:05,972 --> 03:14:09,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So we cannot use the existing submission verbatim.

1129
03:14:10,854 --> 03:14:13,115
[SPEAKER_12]: I would clarify that, Mr. Rousseau, if I could.

1130
03:14:13,175 --> 03:14:28,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So the eligibility period, which typically runs somewhere between three and four months, is, and I assume this is public now, and it hasn't changed since I was told this by the MSBA, but they're moving the timeline up.

1131
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:30,921
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not actually shortening the timeline.

1132
03:14:31,561 --> 03:14:36,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And so my recommendation would be that the actual submission occur in April,

1133
03:14:37,063 --> 03:14:48,108
[SPEAKER_12]: so that if there are other critical infrastructure failures or things that we identify, we can make sure that they are included in the portion of the statement of interest that we supplement for last time.

1134
03:14:48,508 --> 03:14:54,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to submit something in February and then have a pipe burst in March and have that be the thing that would have been the tiebreaker.

1135
03:14:56,852 --> 03:15:01,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, they won't look at anything until April, so there's no downside to submitting until the end.

1136
03:15:02,742 --> 03:15:04,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And you need a city council vote.

1137
03:15:04,663 --> 03:15:06,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So that can be done prior to April so we can.

1138
03:15:08,026 --> 03:15:13,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And thankfully, you're going to be hopefully helping us do the, this again for a second time, the right way.

1139
03:15:13,890 --> 03:15:20,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would assume that we're going to follow the process and be ahead of the game to be ready to say in April.

1140
03:15:20,494 --> 03:15:25,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but even that I think you, you won't know neither you nor the council can vote until you actually have like the.

1141
03:15:26,604 --> 03:15:27,765
[SPEAKER_12]: package.

1142
03:15:27,985 --> 03:15:30,046
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think we can put this in.

1143
03:15:30,907 --> 03:15:38,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I think we'd be ill advised to put it in before April, but we certainly don't want to put it in later than that.

1144
03:15:38,591 --> 03:15:38,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So we good.

1145
03:15:39,291 --> 03:15:43,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we amend it to say April 1, apply by April 1.

1146
03:15:45,589 --> 03:15:48,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know of an upside of applying before the deadline.

1147
03:15:49,091 --> 03:15:55,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think though, you could direct the administration to provide periodic updates leading up to the submission.

1148
03:15:55,735 --> 03:16:07,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the thing that I'm reacting to is there was sort of a hustle last year at the very end to coordinate all the bodies who needed to vote.

1149
03:16:07,982 --> 03:16:13,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure that doesn't happen again, especially like when you come up to April, you're talking about a school vacation week.

1150
03:16:14,377 --> 03:16:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about a change in like operations, both for the school committee and the city council.

1151
03:16:21,042 --> 03:16:31,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, I do want us to be done before we're sort of chaotically trying to make sure that votes can be taken in time for the deadline.

1152
03:16:31,390 --> 03:16:43,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe laying out a very specific timeline that provides for those votes, understanding that the actual final content will not be fully fleshed out until the very end.

1153
03:16:44,329 --> 03:16:54,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion to submit another statement of interest with periodic updates to this committee and submission in April.

1154
03:16:55,097 --> 03:16:57,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll maybe get a timeline.

1155
03:16:57,298 --> 03:16:58,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1156
03:16:58,379 --> 03:16:59,800
[SPEAKER_07]: With a specific timeline.

1157
03:17:00,520 --> 03:17:03,302
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1158
03:17:03,322 --> 03:17:04,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

1159
03:17:05,984 --> 03:17:06,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1160
03:17:07,445 --> 03:17:07,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1161
03:17:08,506 --> 03:17:09,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

1162
03:17:10,047 --> 03:17:10,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1163
03:17:11,108 --> 03:17:11,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1164
03:17:12,509 --> 03:17:12,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1165
03:17:13,604 --> 03:17:14,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1166
03:17:15,205 --> 03:17:15,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1167
03:17:16,365 --> 03:17:17,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone.

1168
03:17:17,866 --> 03:17:18,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1169
03:17:18,966 --> 03:17:19,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1170
03:17:19,606 --> 03:17:19,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1171
03:17:19,906 --> 03:17:20,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lundquist.

1172
03:17:21,527 --> 03:17:21,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1173
03:17:21,747 --> 03:17:23,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

1174
03:17:23,227 --> 03:17:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1175
03:17:24,788 --> 03:17:26,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that.

1176
03:17:27,229 --> 03:17:31,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we could may I just ask one more question about MSBA.

1177
03:17:31,770 --> 03:17:32,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1178
03:17:32,711 --> 03:17:35,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, what's my question?

1179
03:17:36,644 --> 03:17:45,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, given this, and we actually heard tonight from our students about network access.

1180
03:17:45,909 --> 03:17:55,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about this rather incessantly about our high school complex and how challenging it is to communicate inside the building.

1181
03:17:55,254 --> 03:18:05,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also like to make a motion that the administration provides us a recommendation and a plan to fix that problem in a permanent way.

1182
03:18:06,112 --> 03:18:15,677
[SPEAKER_02]: in our existing building structure because we cannot afford to wait an entire generation of students before we have working internet in our high school building.

1183
03:18:17,378 --> 03:18:17,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1184
03:18:19,139 --> 03:18:20,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

1185
03:18:20,840 --> 03:18:25,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a timeline for that or an indication of what that will involve in terms of workload?

1186
03:18:29,705 --> 03:18:34,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a timeline in mind because I'm not the one that can decide on the workload.

1187
03:18:35,407 --> 03:18:37,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need a recommendation.

1188
03:18:37,628 --> 03:18:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect it to happen before budget time, but I am open to what the administration needs to be able to do that.

1189
03:18:44,791 --> 03:18:49,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want us to stop having to talk about poor internet in the building.

1190
03:18:49,893 --> 03:18:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a curriculum issue.

1191
03:18:52,014 --> 03:18:53,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It's embarrassing.

1192
03:18:53,354 --> 03:18:53,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2022.

1193
03:18:55,376 --> 03:18:59,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're trying to make the best 2023, sorry.

1194
03:19:00,179 --> 03:19:06,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're trying to do the best we can with a very, very old building, but I think we have to find a way to get this right.

1195
03:19:08,324 --> 03:19:09,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to do it quickly.

1196
03:19:10,345 --> 03:19:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't wait anymore.

1197
03:19:11,486 --> 03:19:11,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1198
03:19:12,306 --> 03:19:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1199
03:19:14,688 --> 03:19:15,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

1200
03:19:16,569 --> 03:19:17,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

1201
03:19:18,150 --> 03:19:18,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1202
03:19:19,270 --> 03:19:19,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

1203
03:19:20,891 --> 03:19:21,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1204
03:19:22,052 --> 03:19:22,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kritz?

1205
03:19:23,533 --> 03:19:23,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1206
03:19:24,861 --> 03:19:25,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1207
03:19:28,085 --> 03:19:28,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1208
03:19:29,807 --> 03:19:33,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Member so yes, Mayor Lungo cared.

1209
03:19:33,471 --> 03:19:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 the affirmative, 0 the negative, motion passes.

1210
03:19:37,676 --> 03:19:38,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Mustone, yes, 7-0.

1211
03:19:38,957 --> 03:19:39,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1212
03:19:42,714 --> 03:19:47,498
[SPEAKER_12]: So the second part of tonight's update is an update on the FY23 budget.

1213
03:19:47,558 --> 03:19:57,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I mentioned at the outset of our discussion this evening, typically this is something that the administration would be providing you an update on on a quarterly basis.

1214
03:19:57,807 --> 03:20:07,775
[SPEAKER_12]: As the committee knows, since the beginning of our fiscal year, up to and including the present, we've been engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with multiple bargaining units.

1215
03:20:08,215 --> 03:20:11,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you've heard me say on many occasions, both during the budget

1216
03:20:12,288 --> 03:20:19,202
[SPEAKER_12]: development period as well as during our labor updates, that is essentially the primary driver of our budget.

1217
03:20:21,220 --> 03:20:25,062
[SPEAKER_12]: In some ways, you've had many budget updates up until this point.

1218
03:20:25,242 --> 03:20:33,667
[SPEAKER_12]: But for multiple reasons, I wanted to make sure that I provided you with some information tonight with respect to where we are halfway through FY23.

1219
03:20:33,807 --> 03:20:40,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And through various ways, I'm sure you'll receive additional updates in the coming months.

1220
03:20:40,090 --> 03:20:46,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So first, just as a reminder, our operating budget for FY23 is approximately $69.3 million.

1221
03:20:51,610 --> 03:20:53,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Of that approximately.

1222
03:20:55,114 --> 03:21:08,147
[SPEAKER_12]: These numbers I should probably should have in front of me right now but approximately a $42 million are driven by personnel costs that's individual employment agreements at will employees, as well as members of our 10 bargaining units.

1223
03:21:09,643 --> 03:21:19,331
[SPEAKER_12]: That $69.3 million number does not include money that is expenditures that are specifically funded by our ESSER budget.

1224
03:21:19,731 --> 03:21:37,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Our ESSER budget is the COVID-related funds allocated through the state from the federal government, of which there have been three phases of about $700,000 that was initially allocated to the district and expended, the $700,000 being what we refer to as ESSER I.

1225
03:21:37,686 --> 03:21:52,558
[SPEAKER_12]: about $2.1 million, excuse me, $1.4 million was from ESSER II and about $5.2 million is the largest bucket that is considered ESSER III.

1226
03:21:53,298 --> 03:21:58,302
[SPEAKER_12]: There is eligibility requirements for ESSER expenditures.

1227
03:21:58,843 --> 03:22:03,687
[SPEAKER_12]: We've discussed those in the past in a context related to our bargaining as well.

1228
03:22:04,888 --> 03:22:06,068
[SPEAKER_12]: And currently,

1229
03:22:07,996 --> 03:22:11,997
[SPEAKER_12]: these funds will expire at various points in a staggered way, ending in the fall of 2025.

1230
03:22:12,437 --> 03:22:19,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that requires a certain degree of planning and has required a certain degree of planning.

1231
03:22:20,418 --> 03:22:36,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of our recently completed collective bargaining agreements have the potential to have an impact on those funding sources, which is just a piece of information that you'll have to keep in mind as you plan for the coming fiscal year, as well as the one beyond that.

1232
03:22:37,271 --> 03:22:41,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I said the primary drivers are is our personnel costs.

1233
03:22:42,195 --> 03:22:46,398
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll recall that in the spring of 2022 in preparation for FY 23.

1234
03:22:47,579 --> 03:22:56,566
[SPEAKER_12]: We were very transparent about the fact that we were budgeting for a 2% cost of living adjustment for all employees across the board.

1235
03:22:57,527 --> 03:23:05,974
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, our teachers bargaining unit which that agreement was approved by this body and ratified by the union on.

1236
03:23:06,502 --> 03:23:06,802
[SPEAKER_12]: December 19.

1237
03:23:07,063 --> 03:23:15,254
[SPEAKER_12]: That is, it is the largest single driver of our budget, and that settlement for cost of living adjustment landed at 2.5%.

1238
03:23:17,743 --> 03:23:28,591
[SPEAKER_12]: That is about a somewhere between the $200 and $250,000 expense or liability that was not specifically planned for in the FY23 budget.

1239
03:23:28,991 --> 03:23:37,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, that being said, as is always the case in every budget, every fiscal year, there are fluctuations and there is fluidity within various expenses.

1240
03:23:39,474 --> 03:24:04,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, when we look at our financial position, and with the understanding that our FY 22 retroactive payments are going to be charged to what is essentially our surplus from FY 22, at this time, it does not appear as though we would need to seek a supplemental appropriation from the municipality to finish the fiscal year.

1241
03:24:05,061 --> 03:24:10,683
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not to say that our financial position is so strong that we were anticipating a massive surplus.

1242
03:24:10,703 --> 03:24:11,484
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the case.

1243
03:24:11,984 --> 03:24:33,332
[SPEAKER_12]: But when we look at six of the 10 collective bargaining agreements having now been resolved and where we are with regard to a spend rate coming into halfway to the net, really having passed the halfway point in the fiscal year, it would appear as though that we are, our trajectory is such that we will finish somewhere within the,

1244
03:24:35,618 --> 03:24:43,888
[SPEAKER_12]: 200 to $400,000 surplus that is generally where we want the sort of landing spot to be in a given fiscal year.

1245
03:24:43,928 --> 03:24:45,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we're only six months in.

1246
03:24:46,471 --> 03:24:49,494
[SPEAKER_12]: There are any number of variables that can change between now and then.

1247
03:24:50,075 --> 03:24:52,298
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we'll continue to monitor that.

1248
03:24:52,678 --> 03:24:58,705
[SPEAKER_12]: In each of the last two fiscal years, we've slowed spending and put in partial freezes by early March.

1249
03:24:59,525 --> 03:25:02,508
[SPEAKER_12]: My guess is that that will be the case again this year.

1250
03:25:02,589 --> 03:25:12,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, that's not an indication necessarily of a massive problem, but it's an indication of our desire to avoid a massive problem when the fiscal year comes to a close.

1251
03:25:13,499 --> 03:25:26,389
[SPEAKER_12]: A few sort of notes, again, at the halfway point, you'll remember that we had negotiated a new contract with Rico, our vendor for copy machines and printers.

1252
03:25:27,430 --> 03:25:33,135
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a pretty significant vendor agreement that the district has, and the lease expired at the end of FY22.

1253
03:25:35,885 --> 03:25:46,853
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a significant delay in the delivery of the new infrastructure that's part of this new agreement, which is yielding about a $50,000 savings so.

1254
03:25:47,954 --> 03:25:57,141
[SPEAKER_12]: that's that's not necessarily the largest savings throughout the the entire budget but it's it's sort of an example of why when certain expenses come up throughout the throughout the year.

1255
03:25:57,621 --> 03:26:00,623
[SPEAKER_12]: we're generally able to manage and to respond to those.

1256
03:26:01,804 --> 03:26:09,890
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, our IDEA and circuit breaker allocations came in at a $329,000 increase over last year.

1257
03:26:10,750 --> 03:26:19,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We had anticipated a $750,000 increase in out-of-district tuitions and specialized transportation costs.

1258
03:26:19,976 --> 03:26:23,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was included in our allocation.

1259
03:26:23,999 --> 03:26:26,141
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's generally landed about where we

1260
03:26:26,661 --> 03:26:27,662
[SPEAKER_12]: would have expected it to.

1261
03:26:29,103 --> 03:26:31,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, you said many times, personnel being the largest driver.

1262
03:26:32,746 --> 03:26:41,113
[SPEAKER_12]: When I briefed you in September, I believe there were something like 11 paraprofessional vacancies and somewhere a handful of teacher vacancies.

1263
03:26:41,994 --> 03:26:54,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, there are a number of long-term substitutes that are in place in certain teaching positions, but only two true vacancies and approximately five true paraprofessional vacancies.

1264
03:26:55,249 --> 03:26:58,610
[SPEAKER_12]: all of which we're in the process of trying to close those gaps.

1265
03:26:59,030 --> 03:27:02,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much where we are.

1266
03:27:03,772 --> 03:27:07,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

1267
03:27:07,653 --> 03:27:08,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1268
03:27:08,413 --> 03:27:10,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there are any questions.

1269
03:27:10,994 --> 03:27:13,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to presentations of the public.

1270
03:27:14,135 --> 03:27:15,895
[SPEAKER_12]: In that case, let me just say thank you very much.

1271
03:27:16,095 --> 03:27:16,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1272
03:27:16,536 --> 03:27:17,636
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been fun.

1273
03:27:18,856 --> 03:27:19,817
[SPEAKER_07]: No continued business.

1274
03:27:19,977 --> 03:27:24,658
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have one item for new business offered by Member Hays, Member McLaughlin, and Member Mustone.

1275
03:27:25,290 --> 03:27:53,082
[SPEAKER_07]: resolution for district-wide appropriate notification of student incident reports, whereas behavior, accident, and discipline incident reports related to students and student contact are created and retained at each of the district schools, whereas incident reports including individual student names are placed on file for referral by administration and may be used in future meetings and or litigation, be it resolved families and caregivers receive copies of any incident report regarding their student within 24 hours of incidents,

1276
03:27:53,763 --> 03:28:02,168
[SPEAKER_07]: The further resolved information about access to incident reports is included in our student handbook, district policy, and our public facing website.

1277
03:28:03,549 --> 03:28:04,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

1278
03:28:06,070 --> 03:28:06,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1279
03:28:06,450 --> 03:28:07,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it speaks for itself.

1280
03:28:07,991 --> 03:28:10,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to make a motion for it to pass.

1281
03:28:10,753 --> 03:28:19,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that families and caregivers are included in incident reports and understand the nature of them and that they exist and are part of a student's files.

1282
03:28:19,258 --> 03:28:23,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they should have copies of them whenever their student's names are on them.

1283
03:28:23,663 --> 03:28:25,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, Dr. Edwardson.

1284
03:28:27,045 --> 03:28:46,477
[SPEAKER_16]: So in regards to this resolution, the fourth statement about within 24 hours of the incident, I would like to request that an amendment be made because not in all circumstances or in all situations, depending on the nature,

1285
03:28:47,137 --> 03:28:53,761
[SPEAKER_16]: of what has transpired, especially if it's something that could be involving police involvement.

1286
03:28:54,821 --> 03:28:59,964
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's an ongoing police investigation or situation that is.

1287
03:29:02,665 --> 03:29:06,127
[SPEAKER_16]: of a very difficult matter.

1288
03:29:06,147 --> 03:29:20,913
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to have that where you say within 24 hours of an incident, or when reasonably possible, because it is not always possible to receive an incident report within 24 hours.

1289
03:29:24,665 --> 03:29:25,826
[SPEAKER_16]: of something taking place.

1290
03:29:26,667 --> 03:29:41,859
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is also just to protect the district, and to, to make sure that we're not giving out information because we've also received incident reports with other students names listed.

1291
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:46,102
[SPEAKER_16]: and sometimes inaccurate information has been given.

1292
03:29:46,963 --> 03:29:59,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we do need time to be able to also conduct investigations and make sure that what's being listed in the incident report is accurate information.

1293
03:29:59,370 --> 03:30:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1294
03:30:02,852 --> 03:30:03,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

1295
03:30:03,813 --> 03:30:05,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1296
03:30:05,814 --> 03:30:11,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with that as long as we have, but not exceeding time, whatever,

1297
03:30:11,710 --> 03:30:14,251
[SPEAKER_06]: know, I'll defer to you folks on what you think is reasonable for that.

1298
03:30:14,311 --> 03:30:20,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that leaving it open ended leaves that, you know, it could be that they, you know, it could be forever before someone gets an incident report.

1299
03:30:21,054 --> 03:30:26,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not, I guess I should be maybe a little bit more explicit about the incident reports, or at least the ones that that I've seen.

1300
03:30:27,417 --> 03:30:38,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about, you know, a full incident report, like a police incident report, I'm talking about the slips of paper that I've seen that, you know, district uses your student was involved, you know, so and so was involved in an incident.

1301
03:30:39,258 --> 03:30:44,180
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this was reported to the principal, the principal has the paper, you know, they keep that or what have you.

1302
03:30:44,280 --> 03:30:52,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So that sort of incident report, not a full on like criminal, you know, police report incident investigation, but rather your student was involved.

1303
03:30:52,803 --> 03:30:58,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand though, in some instances where you're needing to suss out that information about which students were involved.

1304
03:30:58,765 --> 03:31:01,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I can appreciate the timeframe that you're speaking to.

1305
03:31:01,926 --> 03:31:06,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm okay with saying when reasonable 24 hours of incident

1306
03:31:08,712 --> 03:31:17,724
[SPEAKER_06]: or when reasonably possible, I think you said, but no longer than, what would you say is reasonable?

1307
03:31:20,408 --> 03:31:20,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Two weeks.

1308
03:31:23,911 --> 03:31:29,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would be reasonable because that would give us time to conduct an investigation.

1309
03:31:31,113 --> 03:31:40,535
[SPEAKER_16]: But in terms of trying to submit the incident reports the paper ones that you're talking about within a reasonable amount of time.

1310
03:31:42,215 --> 03:31:45,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I just wanted to make sure that that caveat was there because.

1311
03:31:48,456 --> 03:31:54,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Some situations are something that it's very simple and then there are others that are deeply complicated.

1312
03:31:56,146 --> 03:32:05,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm fine with that amendment for the motion on the floor I remember a lot when I believe member Ruseau has his hand up and I'm going to take our residents.

1313
03:32:07,639 --> 03:32:08,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1314
03:32:09,320 --> 03:32:09,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1315
03:32:09,881 --> 03:32:16,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess I was, I'm a little uncomfortable until I know what we mean by incident reports.

1316
03:32:16,106 --> 03:32:21,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at the bullying incident report on our website, which is a pretty amazing looking form.

1317
03:32:22,591 --> 03:32:28,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But the person writing this is going to be including information about more than one student.

1318
03:32:28,816 --> 03:32:36,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want the staff to be trying to craft incident reports so that they can plan for the

1319
03:32:37,558 --> 03:32:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: eventual release of reports to various people.

1320
03:32:43,599 --> 03:32:50,401
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I also don't want these incident reports to have to be going through a big, an entire redaction process.

1321
03:32:50,661 --> 03:32:57,563
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess this slip of paper that member McLaughlin mentioned, I'm not familiar with them.

1322
03:32:58,463 --> 03:33:06,845
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's a specific name for those and that's what everybody's comfortable with, can we call them that because incident report

1323
03:33:08,005 --> 03:33:15,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if we have a policy saying something about incident reports, well then the bullying incident report is literally called bullying incident report form.

1324
03:33:17,691 --> 03:33:34,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want people to be, the staff or whoever's filling it out to be able to just be free to write the incident report and not be worried about the potential end points of what they're writing, because it's gonna make it just hard to understand.

1325
03:33:34,882 --> 03:33:35,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just gonna be a mess.

1326
03:33:37,386 --> 03:33:42,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what the, if there's a name for those incident reports, I think that'd be good to have that specified.

1327
03:33:44,152 --> 03:33:45,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, member McLaughlin.

1328
03:33:46,353 --> 03:33:50,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's the initial incident report that goes in the file.

1329
03:33:50,457 --> 03:34:00,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, and again, I've seen them both for families that I've been working with and others that the information is not specific.

1330
03:34:00,125 --> 03:34:06,490
[SPEAKER_06]: The principals and assistant principals have been doing this for a long time and they understand how they're written and certainly,

1331
03:34:07,054 --> 03:34:14,677
[SPEAKER_06]: any parent has access to their child's file at any time and any request, they may not know that there are these in their file.

1332
03:34:14,717 --> 03:34:16,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would see them then as well.

1333
03:34:16,337 --> 03:34:22,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that principals and assistant principals and others are aware that these need to be specific to the student and the student's files.

1334
03:34:22,660 --> 03:34:28,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has been the experience in terms of what I've seen when supporting families and districts.

1335
03:34:28,562 --> 03:34:31,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say initial incident report, and I would say that

1336
03:34:32,782 --> 03:34:42,187
[SPEAKER_06]: they are written in such a way that other students are not identified for that particular family who's receiving the incident reports in their home.

1337
03:34:43,228 --> 03:34:44,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So the- Thank you very much.

1338
03:34:46,149 --> 03:34:47,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Initial incident report, yes.

1339
03:34:47,430 --> 03:34:49,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval as amended.

1340
03:34:49,631 --> 03:34:52,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you wanna go first?

1341
03:34:53,055 --> 03:34:57,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so just in our situation alone, I just wanted to- I'm just kidding.

1342
03:34:57,838 --> 03:34:58,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1343
03:34:58,458 --> 03:34:59,479
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I said you cut the line.

1344
03:34:59,679 --> 03:35:01,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that I know.

1345
03:35:02,481 --> 03:35:03,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I created the line.

1346
03:35:03,522 --> 03:35:04,122
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

1347
03:35:05,123 --> 03:35:08,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So just FYI for a member who's still at home.

1348
03:35:09,926 --> 03:35:16,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So our daughter had filled out what is called Medford High School, Medford Vocation Technical High School Incident Report Forms.

1349
03:35:17,671 --> 03:35:21,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So in her situation, a threat,

1350
03:35:22,554 --> 03:35:24,295
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever was going on at the time.

1351
03:35:25,155 --> 03:35:28,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Went to her as a principal, an incident report was written with the assistant principal.

1352
03:35:28,756 --> 03:35:30,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It is called the Method High Incident Report.

1353
03:35:31,077 --> 03:35:33,958
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some for students.

1354
03:35:34,978 --> 03:35:37,279
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some for faculty and staff.

1355
03:35:37,960 --> 03:35:40,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an incident report form for administrative response.

1356
03:35:40,781 --> 03:35:44,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, if there's anything that you think is different, you know what I mean?

1357
03:35:44,382 --> 03:35:49,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, tell me if you think that there's something different that I'm not saying, to correct me.

1358
03:35:49,524 --> 03:35:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's all I'm saying.

1359
03:35:50,936 --> 03:36:11,857
[SPEAKER_04]: just to correct me, so there is incident report form, the administrative response, there's the incident report form for faculty and staff statements, there is the incident report for students, and also Joanne might also know the stat on this, and I believe if I'm correct that if there are three incident reports, then you can file a police report.

1360
03:36:14,455 --> 03:36:18,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a no harassment order, three incidents of harassment.

1361
03:36:18,417 --> 03:36:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but then you can also file a police report too.

1362
03:36:21,458 --> 03:36:23,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's different reports at the high school.

1363
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: One, Officer Conway takes care of, which would be the police report.

1364
03:36:29,322 --> 03:36:39,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also reports that the high school fills out when your child comes to the school with a complaint or worry or a threat or whatever else is going on.

1365
03:36:39,347 --> 03:36:42,148
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are some that students fill out.

1366
03:36:42,248 --> 03:36:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some for the staff.

1367
03:36:44,642 --> 03:36:50,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some that I have here that say administrative response, but they are also redacted.

1368
03:36:50,724 --> 03:36:52,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you request them, they, they are redacted.

1369
03:36:52,904 --> 03:36:57,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause obviously if a student is talking about another student, they're going to say, you know, me and Melanie or whatever.

1370
03:36:57,386 --> 03:37:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so they do need to be redacted before they're getting to anybody else.

1371
03:37:02,167 --> 03:37:02,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1372
03:37:02,367 --> 03:37:03,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one's about the initial report.

1373
03:37:04,367 --> 03:37:04,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Initial.

1374
03:37:04,828 --> 03:37:04,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1375
03:37:05,008 --> 03:37:06,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And I usually think it's the administrative report.

1376
03:37:06,988 --> 03:37:13,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not necessarily the inner workings of the investigation and who's doing what it's what.

1377
03:37:14,304 --> 03:37:30,354
[SPEAKER_06]: is taken from the building principle leadership perspective, that they know that this incident occurred and that is recorded and has, you know, goes into a child's file or is collected, you know, in a number of, you know, if there's more than one, there might be a collection of them.

1378
03:37:30,694 --> 03:37:35,937
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be really clear, I would like to be really clear, Mayor, this is not just specific to bullying.

1379
03:37:36,397 --> 03:37:37,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1380
03:37:37,118 --> 03:37:43,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to make sure that folks understand that, that if there's an incident where your, you know, your child gets cut,

1381
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:54,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, like they're doing something and they maybe have a, normally you'll get a report home from a nurse, a phone call from a nurse or something like that, but there will also be an incident report.

1382
03:37:54,322 --> 03:37:54,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1383
03:37:54,562 --> 03:38:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that should come home so that families know that because maybe you get the phone call, maybe you don't get the phone call, but you're there.

1384
03:38:02,424 --> 03:38:05,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So having that as a record, I think is really important.

1385
03:38:05,605 --> 03:38:05,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1386
03:38:06,145 --> 03:38:09,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've noticed that too, not always notified.

1387
03:38:10,686 --> 03:38:12,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that definitely has to be part of it.

1388
03:38:13,652 --> 03:38:24,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think to a student signing something with their signature, definitely is important that a parent gets told about that right away.

1389
03:38:24,736 --> 03:38:25,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1390
03:38:25,196 --> 03:38:31,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was not always, at least in a situation that I'm very familiar with, that did not happen.

1391
03:38:31,918 --> 03:38:33,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So just FYI.

1392
03:38:33,679 --> 03:38:34,359
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1393
03:38:34,539 --> 03:38:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1394
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:37,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record.

1395
03:38:40,261 --> 03:38:41,662
[SPEAKER_07]: One second, just press the button.

1396
03:38:42,472 --> 03:38:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Little person.

1397
03:38:44,393 --> 03:38:45,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the button?

1398
03:38:45,233 --> 03:38:46,414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, you're on.

1399
03:38:46,534 --> 03:38:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1400
03:38:47,154 --> 03:38:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Angela Sasso, 8 Medicine Street.

1401
03:38:50,315 --> 03:38:51,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a couple of questions.

1402
03:38:52,256 --> 03:39:04,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So first I would like to say I'm glad to see the improvement in the bullying protocols, but I do have a question.

1403
03:39:04,301 --> 03:39:09,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Sandy Hook response app,

1404
03:39:10,541 --> 03:39:13,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So a student can do that anonymously.

1405
03:39:15,063 --> 03:39:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a 911, I get it, it goes to the police.

1406
03:39:18,165 --> 03:39:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's an incident, a bullying incident, where does that go?

1407
03:39:22,407 --> 03:39:24,088
[SPEAKER_05]: At the school level, who does that go to?

1408
03:39:25,169 --> 03:39:27,630
[SPEAKER_16]: It will go to the administrators of the school.

1409
03:39:27,810 --> 03:39:32,492
[SPEAKER_05]: The central staff or the principal, who does it go to?

1410
03:39:32,712 --> 03:39:34,573
[SPEAKER_16]: It will go to central staff, I believe.

1411
03:39:35,414 --> 03:39:37,415
[SPEAKER_16]: The principal, assistant principals,

1412
03:39:40,444 --> 03:39:41,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It should, okay.

1413
03:39:41,544 --> 03:39:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So then what does the principal do with it?

1414
03:39:47,465 --> 03:39:50,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And central staff is the school leaders?

1415
03:39:51,986 --> 03:39:52,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1416
03:39:52,646 --> 03:39:53,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is the timeline?

1417
03:39:53,906 --> 03:39:55,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm sorry.

1418
03:39:56,767 --> 03:39:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, sure.

1419
03:39:58,987 --> 03:40:01,928
[SPEAKER_18]: So central staff is school district leadership.

1420
03:40:02,568 --> 03:40:04,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Building leadership is principal and assistant principals.

1421
03:40:06,148 --> 03:40:07,469
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll go to the principal.

1422
03:40:07,969 --> 03:40:08,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1423
03:40:09,690 --> 03:40:18,716
[SPEAKER_18]: the report by policy, which is actually going to be reviewed by the Rules Policy Committee and started to do that process already.

1424
03:40:20,257 --> 03:40:23,039
[SPEAKER_18]: The Medford policy says building principle.

1425
03:40:25,921 --> 03:40:28,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so maybe you shouldn't go anywhere, Peter.

1426
03:40:31,165 --> 03:40:37,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the building principle gets the initial report, so you don't, you have to investigate that report now.

1427
03:40:37,430 --> 03:40:39,391
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to deem whether that's bullying

1428
03:40:39,958 --> 03:40:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: or harassment are, right?

1429
03:40:42,359 --> 03:40:43,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?

1430
03:40:43,540 --> 03:40:43,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1431
03:40:43,840 --> 03:40:44,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1432
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1433
03:40:45,120 --> 03:40:46,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the timeline on that?

1434
03:40:47,722 --> 03:40:51,823
[SPEAKER_18]: A report should be generated and finalized probably within 10 days.

1435
03:40:52,143 --> 03:40:52,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1436
03:40:52,744 --> 03:41:07,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Should properly investigate to make sure, I mean, immediately, the principal should work with the system principals to identify the parties involved, isolate various individuals, call them individually so that you can have

1437
03:41:09,628 --> 03:41:16,712
[SPEAKER_18]: individual conversations so that there isn't a group mentality and you don't taint anything along those lines.

1438
03:41:17,052 --> 03:41:28,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, I mean, from my conversations with you over the years, we've worked very diligently, and in the emails I've provided you, the things that have changed specifically over the past several years.

1439
03:41:30,199 --> 03:41:37,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it is bullying, what happens then if you deem it?

1440
03:41:37,683 --> 03:41:38,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So you do an investigation,

1441
03:41:39,403 --> 03:41:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: a student's being bullied.

1442
03:41:40,864 --> 03:41:45,045
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and it needs to be under state law, three specific separate instances.

1443
03:41:45,245 --> 03:41:46,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has to be three instances.

1444
03:41:46,886 --> 03:41:51,128
[SPEAKER_18]: So by different, not by different people, state law is clear on that.

1445
03:41:51,248 --> 03:41:52,668
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to be the individual.

1446
03:41:53,189 --> 03:41:53,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1447
03:41:53,569 --> 03:41:57,850
[SPEAKER_18]: So trust me as a former school leader was a very painful thing.

1448
03:41:58,251 --> 03:41:59,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, can you address the chair?

1449
03:41:59,391 --> 03:42:00,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1450
03:42:00,391 --> 03:42:00,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1451
03:42:01,652 --> 03:42:04,833
[SPEAKER_18]: The comment from the gallery was, or from Ms.

1452
03:42:04,853 --> 03:42:06,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Sarasota was that

1453
03:42:09,120 --> 03:42:10,460
[SPEAKER_18]: that it could be multiple people.

1454
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:11,280
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not true.

1455
03:42:11,961 --> 03:42:25,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It's individuals, not multiple people, which as a former school leader was a painful process to go through, standing before a judicial body and being told, no, this isn't bullying because it wasn't one individual person.

1456
03:42:28,203 --> 03:42:32,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So if, I keep getting down like this.

1457
03:42:32,464 --> 03:42:37,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a student, so you get one incident, what happens?

1458
03:42:37,526 --> 03:42:38,306
[SPEAKER_05]: in that incident?

1459
03:42:38,386 --> 03:42:43,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it you work with the students to the bully to not do it?

1460
03:42:43,427 --> 03:42:44,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what happens?

1461
03:42:45,508 --> 03:42:52,710
[SPEAKER_18]: So there should be a school response to support and to go through with Councilors, assistant principals and others.

1462
03:42:53,390 --> 03:42:57,231
[SPEAKER_18]: I will say that I don't know necessarily that this is on the agenda.

1463
03:42:57,271 --> 03:43:03,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it might be better served as a rules policy, but I am happy to answer at the chair and the committees.

1464
03:43:03,812 --> 03:43:06,273
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm just, I would say the first instance,

1465
03:43:06,778 --> 03:43:19,266
[SPEAKER_18]: you definitely want to make sure that you're documenting, um, you know, that letters being issued, uh, outlining that, uh, this could end up in front of juvenile justice, juvenile court, uh, things along those lines.

1466
03:43:19,666 --> 03:43:25,710
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, then the second one should come with more progressive discipline, more notification, bring the family.

1467
03:43:25,750 --> 03:43:32,795
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the third is, uh, under Massachusetts statute, as Madam Mayor mentioned, uh, that's where criminal harassment comes

1468
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:38,551
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no other mechanism except for criminal harassment.

1469
03:43:38,691 --> 03:43:40,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Two last things, sorry, I know I'm being long.

1470
03:43:41,312 --> 03:43:51,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So each student, so the person who report is, reports the incident and the aggressor.

1471
03:43:51,795 --> 03:43:54,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Does an incident report go in both of their files?

1472
03:43:56,216 --> 03:43:59,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my case, I had nothing in my daughter's file.

1473
03:44:00,305 --> 03:44:02,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to see that that's a change.

1474
03:44:04,186 --> 03:44:16,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And my last thing is when these incident reports initially go in and then there's an investigation, where are they going?

1475
03:44:16,991 --> 03:44:22,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going into a database so that everybody can see what's going on?

1476
03:44:22,113 --> 03:44:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my case, there were many, many people involved and I had to keep repeating the story, which was fine.

1477
03:44:29,867 --> 03:44:40,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it would be helpful for central staff, principals, teachers, directors to have a place to go to see this information.

1478
03:44:40,976 --> 03:44:41,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that happening?

1479
03:44:42,898 --> 03:44:43,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

1480
03:44:44,680 --> 03:44:45,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

1481
03:44:45,340 --> 03:44:47,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I just make a suggestion?

1482
03:44:48,002 --> 03:44:48,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ms.

1483
03:44:48,463 --> 03:44:51,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Sasso's questions are really good ones.

1484
03:44:51,786 --> 03:44:57,010
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ones we're actively talking about at the Rules and Policy Subcommittee because we are

1485
03:44:57,498 --> 03:44:59,539
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the entire policy.

1486
03:44:59,679 --> 03:45:00,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had one meeting.

1487
03:45:01,160 --> 03:45:04,581
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another meeting that needs to be scheduled upcoming.

1488
03:45:04,922 --> 03:45:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what I would love is if you were, if we sent you a copy of the current policy, if you can identify for us, even if you can't come to the meeting, where those places are that in your instance, you did not see evidence of those things.

1489
03:45:20,889 --> 03:45:23,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think there's two things that can happen, right?

1490
03:45:23,310 --> 03:45:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We can

1491
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: change the policy if the policy is not working for students.

1492
03:45:29,323 --> 03:45:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that we can do through rules and policy subcommittee is get to the like, I'm looking for the right word, the like efficacy of the response consistent with the policy, right?

1493
03:45:43,972 --> 03:45:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two components.

1494
03:45:44,993 --> 03:45:45,153
[SPEAKER_02]: There's

1495
03:45:45,472 --> 03:45:48,537
[SPEAKER_02]: does the policy exist in a way that's suitable?

1496
03:45:48,657 --> 03:45:50,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, are we doing it?

1497
03:45:51,782 --> 03:45:54,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are we not?

1498
03:45:54,466 --> 03:45:57,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think your comments and your questions are really good ones.

1499
03:45:58,366 --> 03:46:01,907
[SPEAKER_02]: are not like explicitly on the agenda because we're not talking about bullying on the agenda.

1500
03:46:01,927 --> 03:46:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there is a place for that.

1501
03:46:03,987 --> 03:46:05,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to hear your comments.

1502
03:46:05,568 --> 03:46:08,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I probably owe you a phone call from before the holidays.

1503
03:46:09,308 --> 03:46:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the right place for your comments.

1504
03:46:14,169 --> 03:46:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, I think the question that I have is, is our policy the problem?

1505
03:46:21,751 --> 03:46:24,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is the efficacy of the response the problem?

1506
03:46:24,871 --> 03:46:26,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And the solution is different.

1507
03:46:27,694 --> 03:46:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on which of those things it is.

1508
03:46:29,494 --> 03:46:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to help.

1509
03:46:30,215 --> 03:46:30,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1510
03:46:30,835 --> 03:46:31,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1511
03:46:31,475 --> 03:46:31,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1512
03:46:31,895 --> 03:46:32,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1513
03:46:33,255 --> 03:46:33,575
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute.

1514
03:46:34,275 --> 03:46:35,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So member McLaughlin.

1515
03:46:35,876 --> 03:46:36,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1516
03:46:36,216 --> 03:46:36,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1517
03:46:36,936 --> 03:46:38,036
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I agree.

1518
03:46:38,216 --> 03:46:42,777
[SPEAKER_06]: We need you at, um, you know, the, or at least your feedback at the meeting.

1519
03:46:42,857 --> 03:46:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to clarify, um, to the chair.

1520
03:46:46,178 --> 03:46:51,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I know member Graham was saying one of the things that the rules and policy, um, subcommittee can do is change policy.

1521
03:46:51,579 --> 03:46:52,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that's not what she meant.

1522
03:46:53,188 --> 03:46:55,589
[SPEAKER_06]: we can make recommendations for changes of policy.

1523
03:46:55,669 --> 03:47:02,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that will become before the whole body and then the whole body votes on whether the changes can occur based on the recommendations that we make.

1524
03:47:02,192 --> 03:47:03,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of the part of the process.

1525
03:47:04,053 --> 03:47:12,176
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that to her point around the, you know, what are the issues, the policy or the efficacy and the way that it's sort of been played out is really important.

1526
03:47:12,697 --> 03:47:18,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we can add this to, we will add it when we report out from the subcommittee.

1527
03:47:19,069 --> 03:47:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: it to the agenda.

1528
03:47:19,930 --> 03:47:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's another opportunity to give feedback when it's at the reported out from the subcommittee to the whole agenda, because I think there's some other things that could be addressed.

1529
03:47:28,276 --> 03:47:29,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1530
03:47:29,657 --> 03:47:35,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. name and address for the record on the motion 2023 dash 01.

1531
03:47:39,984 --> 03:47:42,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Richard Orlando, Winford way Bedford.

1532
03:47:44,167 --> 03:47:46,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Just want to make a few comments.

1533
03:47:46,609 --> 03:47:47,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking today about

1534
03:47:48,820 --> 03:47:59,582
[SPEAKER_15]: whole situation, and I thought about what's meant for public school system, what its purpose is, and it's really about creating a safe environment that we can deliver excellence in education.

1535
03:48:00,603 --> 03:48:11,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I look forward, and I suspect you do as well as everybody in the community, would love to see the conversation begin to focus on education, but obviously school safety is the focus right now.

1536
03:48:13,065 --> 03:48:15,546
[SPEAKER_15]: So just on the current high school problem, just to

1537
03:48:16,459 --> 03:48:22,321
[SPEAKER_15]: There were a few questions on what has changed.

1538
03:48:23,621 --> 03:48:26,642
[SPEAKER_15]: So I spoke to a teacher last Friday.

1539
03:48:27,822 --> 03:48:37,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not provide the person's name, but he said it was a student, a girl student in the corridor at not the appropriate time class was going on.

1540
03:48:38,466 --> 03:48:41,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And he just indicated she needed to get to her class.

1541
03:48:42,627 --> 03:48:45,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Her response to him was expletive deleted you.

1542
03:48:46,343 --> 03:48:48,284
[SPEAKER_15]: the school expletive deleted.

1543
03:48:49,325 --> 03:48:50,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm, interesting.

1544
03:48:50,705 --> 03:48:55,928
[SPEAKER_15]: He then described a situation in the bathroom, six boys in the bathroom.

1545
03:48:57,729 --> 03:49:00,770
[SPEAKER_15]: A monitor went in there, said, you need to dispel, get outside.

1546
03:49:01,591 --> 03:49:02,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Only one left.

1547
03:49:03,652 --> 03:49:08,954
[SPEAKER_15]: The person went, got a resource officer, and they gave the resource officer a bunch of lip as well.

1548
03:49:09,915 --> 03:49:11,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess I would ask the school committee

1549
03:49:12,722 --> 03:49:16,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you know about these infractions to the recently changed policies?

1550
03:49:20,064 --> 03:49:23,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I suspect you're probably either not gonna answer or you're gonna say no.

1551
03:49:25,185 --> 03:49:26,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Have the students been identified?

1552
03:49:26,866 --> 03:49:29,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Not names, but do you even know who those students were that did that?

1553
03:49:30,867 --> 03:49:33,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been told of any incidents from the school committee.

1554
03:49:34,008 --> 03:49:35,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I can speak for all of us.

1555
03:49:37,489 --> 03:49:39,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the students- Excuse me, may I?

1556
03:49:39,929 --> 03:49:40,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for a moment.

1557
03:49:40,510 --> 03:49:40,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1558
03:49:42,546 --> 03:49:46,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion on the floor, number one, that I'd like to move the question in a moment.

1559
03:49:46,629 --> 03:49:58,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, while we work to set policy, we do not get informed of the day-to-day happenings of the school in the disciplinary process, as we talked about previously.

1560
03:49:58,517 --> 03:50:01,559
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a law called FERPA, which is, if you know HIPAA, right?

1561
03:50:01,599 --> 03:50:03,040
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to the doctor, you know HIPAA, right?

1562
03:50:03,140 --> 03:50:07,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Even no matter if I was your wife, Mr. Orlando, and I called the doctor and I said,

1563
03:50:07,768 --> 03:50:11,251
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs a doctor's appointment, and I want to know whether he went to the doctor's appointment or not.

1564
03:50:12,652 --> 03:50:13,312
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't tell me.

1565
03:50:13,332 --> 03:50:14,253
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

1566
03:50:14,313 --> 03:50:15,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the same for FERPA.

1567
03:50:16,114 --> 03:50:16,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot.

1568
03:50:16,975 --> 03:50:17,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the federal law.

1569
03:50:18,196 --> 03:50:19,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have that.

1570
03:50:19,317 --> 03:50:20,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

1571
03:50:20,277 --> 03:50:20,398
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1572
03:50:20,698 --> 03:50:21,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're moving the question.

1573
03:50:21,999 --> 03:50:22,980
[SPEAKER_15]: My point is.

1574
03:50:23,600 --> 03:50:24,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Move the question.

1575
03:50:24,200 --> 03:50:24,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second?

1576
03:50:26,422 --> 03:50:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Second to the motion.

1577
03:50:27,323 --> 03:50:27,763
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

1578
03:50:28,364 --> 03:50:30,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Second as amended by Member Graham.

1579
03:50:30,305 --> 03:50:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: We could take a roll on this, unless anybody wants to suspend the rules to talk off subject.

1580
03:50:39,066 --> 03:50:41,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we finish the motion first, and then we can hear from Mr. Orlando?

1581
03:50:41,587 --> 03:50:43,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to suspend the rules to hear?

1582
03:50:43,488 --> 03:50:46,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to get the motion finished first, and then we can decide what we want.

1583
03:50:46,209 --> 03:50:47,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval as amended.

1584
03:50:48,770 --> 03:50:49,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

1585
03:50:49,350 --> 03:50:50,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like the motion?

1586
03:50:52,772 --> 03:50:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on up.

1587
03:50:54,713 --> 03:50:55,533
[SPEAKER_11]: This is about the motion.

1588
03:50:55,713 --> 03:50:55,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1589
03:50:56,313 --> 03:50:57,434
[SPEAKER_11]: This is about the resolution.

1590
03:50:57,454 --> 03:50:58,014
[SPEAKER_11]: The resolution, yes.

1591
03:51:05,277 --> 03:51:05,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1592
03:51:07,421 --> 03:51:32,301
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the resolution, as I understand it, and I'm not in any way commenting on the conversation since the resolution was introduced, but I think the administration's questions on the resolution come down to the point that was being discussed here a few minutes ago, that with all of the different forms that are used in the variety of incidents that occur, without a very firm definition,

1593
03:51:33,561 --> 03:51:37,044
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few different scenarios, and none of them are particularly favorable.

1594
03:51:37,845 --> 03:51:51,936
[SPEAKER_12]: One is administrators start drafting forms not to expedite resolution of the situations that the forms are meant to capture and respond to, but in anticipation of their disclosure.

1595
03:51:52,537 --> 03:51:54,859
[SPEAKER_12]: That will create an operational challenge.

1596
03:51:55,794 --> 03:52:08,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I take the objective, the underlying objective of the resolution to be that we want to make sure that we are communicating clearly and thoroughly with families of students who are involved in incidents.

1597
03:52:10,739 --> 03:52:20,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I think our recommendation would be to expeditiously, because I think we all understand the urgency behind these issues,

1598
03:52:21,058 --> 03:52:33,126
[SPEAKER_12]: develop and define a particular form that is specifically designed to serve the objective of this resolution, which is to provide documented information, documentation,

1599
03:52:34,076 --> 03:52:51,595
[SPEAKER_12]: to the families of the students that are involved, and to do so in accordance with a timeline, but to try to take the forms that were referenced earlier, that each of which have a specific purpose, some of which is about data reporting to the state,

1600
03:52:52,216 --> 03:53:02,938
[SPEAKER_12]: others are to communicate quickly amongst administrators so that they have an accurate summary of everything that occurred so that additional investigatory steps can take place.

1601
03:53:03,419 --> 03:53:14,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be imprudent to try to advance the very admirable objective of trying to provide transparency to families

1602
03:53:15,080 --> 03:53:18,061
[SPEAKER_12]: through the forms that were created to serve other purposes.

1603
03:53:18,601 --> 03:53:32,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would recommend, I think the subcommittee is probably the better place to develop that, but I also think the administration could develop the type of form meant to do what you're asking, submit it to the committee and expeditiously as quickly as possible.

1604
03:53:33,086 --> 03:53:38,648
[SPEAKER_12]: And for that to be the form that has to be transmitted to families within a set time period.

1605
03:53:38,728 --> 03:53:44,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be wiser than trying to apply the transparency goal to forms that are meant for other purposes.

1606
03:53:47,351 --> 03:54:00,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm willing to make an amendment to the motion that, you know, either for the next school committee meeting or the one after that, that a form be presented to us that would be part of that for, you know, that would be the identified form that we're talking about this initial incident report.

1607
03:54:01,355 --> 03:54:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not willing to so I'm willing to make that amendment.

1608
03:54:04,696 --> 03:54:11,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I am reluctant to refer it to committee because this has been referred to committee and has sat in committee for over a year.

1609
03:54:12,659 --> 03:54:13,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would

1610
03:54:14,105 --> 03:54:28,956
[SPEAKER_06]: ask my colleagues to consider an amendment that we allow the school committee, the school administration to present us with a form by the superintendent what do you feel comfortable with the January, January 23, the January 23.

1611
03:54:31,693 --> 03:54:32,013
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting.

1612
03:54:32,934 --> 03:54:35,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to be clear, because I want to make sure I feel like we're on the same page.

1613
03:54:35,817 --> 03:54:36,697
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to confirm that.

1614
03:54:37,078 --> 03:54:42,342
[SPEAKER_12]: So it might be the case that there's pieces of information that would exist in other forms.

1615
03:54:42,442 --> 03:54:42,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1616
03:54:42,762 --> 03:54:50,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of which may ultimately need to be turned over, you know, depending on what their record status is, but that the purpose of this form

1617
03:54:51,047 --> 03:54:54,548
[SPEAKER_12]: is to inform the parents of an incident that their child was involved in.

1618
03:54:54,928 --> 03:55:02,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And anyone involved in generating or drafting would have to understand that this is going to whatever student is involved in this, it's going to their family.

1619
03:55:03,031 --> 03:55:06,892
[SPEAKER_12]: And so all other privacy considerations would have to be taken into account.

1620
03:55:07,152 --> 03:55:07,672
[SPEAKER_06]: May I, ma'am?

1621
03:55:08,952 --> 03:55:09,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's correct.

1622
03:55:09,853 --> 03:55:17,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And also for additional information beyond that, one would hope that the school and the families will build a relationship to have further conversation.

1623
03:55:18,274 --> 03:55:22,856
[SPEAKER_06]: and that that would therefore encourage relationship so that the process moves more smoothly.

1624
03:55:23,676 --> 03:55:32,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And that also parents know through, you know, procedural safeguards and other means that they have access to their child's file at any point, you know, that they can request the student's file.

1625
03:55:32,339 --> 03:55:33,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that.

1626
03:55:33,680 --> 03:55:41,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say, yes, that's exactly what it is to inform the families and encourage communication both ways.

1627
03:55:41,763 --> 03:55:43,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And the last point I would just make is that that seems

1628
03:55:44,775 --> 03:55:45,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Reasonable.

1629
03:55:45,456 --> 03:55:49,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's terms, as I said, a very admirable objective transparency is important.

1630
03:55:49,820 --> 03:55:52,363
[SPEAKER_12]: It is part of, as you say, how we build those relationships.

1631
03:55:54,125 --> 03:55:59,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I think developing this sort of idea and advancing that objective in real time right now.

1632
03:56:00,591 --> 03:56:03,114
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there could be other pieces that we're not thinking about.

1633
03:56:03,214 --> 03:56:06,257
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think you I can't commit to this personally, but I think

1634
03:56:06,758 --> 03:56:22,986
[SPEAKER_12]: You at your next meeting, you'll have the opportunity to sort of hear what the administration's thinking is on this potentially see a draft form and hear any particular problems with this plan that may have been identified in the, in the, you know, in the two weeks that have, you know, that will be playing out quickly.

1635
03:56:23,206 --> 03:56:23,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1636
03:56:23,786 --> 03:56:24,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1637
03:56:24,186 --> 03:56:24,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1638
03:56:25,327 --> 03:56:27,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion motion as amended.

1639
03:56:28,305 --> 03:56:28,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

1640
03:56:28,605 --> 03:56:29,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1641
03:56:29,466 --> 03:56:33,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, can I just ask, are you speaking about incident reports?

1642
03:56:33,529 --> 03:56:39,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they want to say something about incident reports, I think we should hear them before we vote.

1643
03:56:39,613 --> 03:56:39,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1644
03:56:40,594 --> 03:56:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1645
03:56:42,496 --> 03:56:44,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to say something about incident reports?

1646
03:56:44,497 --> 03:56:45,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're in line.

1647
03:56:46,378 --> 03:56:46,639
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1648
03:56:46,879 --> 03:56:47,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1649
03:56:47,579 --> 03:56:47,779
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1650
03:56:48,180 --> 03:56:48,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1651
03:56:48,960 --> 03:56:49,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1654
03:56:57,387 --> 03:56:57,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Hays.

1655
03:56:58,922 --> 03:56:59,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1656
03:57:00,202 --> 03:57:00,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Krantz.

1657
03:57:01,743 --> 03:57:01,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1658
03:57:02,843 --> 03:57:03,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

1659
03:57:05,844 --> 03:57:06,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1660
03:57:06,985 --> 03:57:07,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mesto.

1661
03:57:09,385 --> 03:57:09,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1662
03:57:10,706 --> 03:57:12,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Members, no yes, Mayor Longo, Karen.

1663
03:57:13,387 --> 03:57:15,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1664
03:57:15,247 --> 03:57:16,448
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1665
03:57:16,628 --> 03:57:20,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Now is there suspension of the rules to let a resident speak?

1666
03:57:27,501 --> 03:57:42,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You can you can share ocean to allow it I would make a motion to suspend the rules to allow a resident to speak under the typical time that each resident has allotted to speak, please.

1667
03:57:44,230 --> 03:57:46,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Your name and address, you have three minutes.

1668
03:57:49,159 --> 03:57:50,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we have to vote.

1669
03:57:50,440 --> 03:57:51,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

1670
03:57:51,080 --> 03:57:51,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1671
03:57:51,501 --> 03:57:53,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

1672
03:57:54,723 --> 03:58:00,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin seconded by second member Graham roll call please.

1673
03:58:03,709 --> 03:58:04,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1674
03:58:05,350 --> 03:58:05,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1675
03:58:06,511 --> 03:58:06,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1676
03:58:06,691 --> 03:58:06,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1677
03:58:07,931 --> 03:58:08,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1678
03:58:18,995 --> 03:58:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, we are local correct.

1679
03:58:21,276 --> 03:58:22,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, some of the affirmative zero and the negative.

1680
03:58:23,696 --> 03:58:25,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

1681
03:58:25,477 --> 03:58:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: One more, one more, one more second.

1682
03:58:27,357 --> 03:58:27,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1683
03:58:29,037 --> 03:58:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, can we just, I just want to be clear, what you're about to speak about is not on the agenda.

1684
03:58:34,279 --> 03:58:36,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means we can't respond to you.

1685
03:58:36,959 --> 03:58:41,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it does not, it does not mean we don't want to, it means we can't.

1686
03:58:41,700 --> 03:58:44,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So we welcome your feedback, just know that

1687
03:58:46,115 --> 03:58:46,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to speak.

1688
03:58:47,516 --> 03:58:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I take the law seriously.

1689
03:58:51,338 --> 03:58:52,058
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the law.

1690
03:58:52,598 --> 03:59:05,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you.

1691
03:59:05,185 --> 03:59:07,126
[SPEAKER_15]: We still have the issues going on at the high school.

1692
03:59:09,207 --> 03:59:12,929
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would just ask, not a question, but

1693
03:59:14,790 --> 03:59:32,079
[SPEAKER_15]: The real underlying issue is the student behavior, the expected behaviors by the students, what policies, consequences, disciplinary actions have been outlined by the school committee to revert some of the ones they put in place that somewhat created this problem.

1694
03:59:33,119 --> 03:59:43,125
[SPEAKER_15]: You can, I won't go into them, you can list a whole in order of severity, going from just disrupting a class to a physical,

1695
03:59:44,383 --> 03:59:47,765
[SPEAKER_15]: violent action, all the way through, there's probably a dozen of them you can list.

1696
03:59:48,325 --> 03:59:59,012
[SPEAKER_15]: And for each of those, having a consequence and a disciplinary action is what's going to start to change the behavior, not just restricting where kids can hang out.

1697
03:59:59,832 --> 04:00:02,274
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to have both or you're not going to have success.

1698
04:00:03,774 --> 04:00:10,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Without those corrections policies, it's going to be marginal what you get in terms of the action plan.

1699
04:00:10,659 --> 04:00:12,920
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would just ask you to look at the policies,

1700
04:00:13,649 --> 04:00:16,770
[SPEAKER_15]: revisit those and tie in disciplinary actions.

1701
04:00:17,871 --> 04:00:23,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Brandl asked a question, what happens if a student doesn't have their badge?

1702
04:00:25,693 --> 04:00:26,434
[SPEAKER_15]: There wasn't an answer.

1703
04:00:26,974 --> 04:00:33,376
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are the kinds of things, as simple as that, because that's the way you're going to identify the offending student.

1704
04:00:35,237 --> 04:00:36,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So those things need to be thought through.

1705
04:00:40,030 --> 04:00:44,894
[SPEAKER_15]: It's basically establishing a culture of acceptable behavior by the student body.

1706
04:00:45,474 --> 04:00:49,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And then where they are becomes less of an issue because they know they have to be respectful.

1707
04:00:50,418 --> 04:00:52,519
[SPEAKER_15]: They have rules and there are consequences.

1708
04:00:52,840 --> 04:00:53,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1709
04:00:56,142 --> 04:00:56,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1710
04:00:57,443 --> 04:00:58,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1711
04:00:59,885 --> 04:01:01,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Lisa Macaron.

1712
04:01:01,646 --> 04:01:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a former 50 year resident of Medford.

1713
04:01:05,638 --> 04:01:19,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold my house in early October because of the following problems I had encountered in the past year prompted me to sell my house as quickly as possible to evade the next school year.

1714
04:01:20,824 --> 04:01:27,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can explain in some detail some of the reasons why I sold my house.

1715
04:01:29,128 --> 04:01:31,709
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter was constantly

1716
04:01:33,001 --> 04:01:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: bullied.

1717
04:01:34,162 --> 04:01:35,562
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd call me crying.

1718
04:01:36,083 --> 04:01:44,467
[SPEAKER_03]: She was hiding in the bathroom because girls would, you know, follow her in there and be on a mission and bully her in the bathroom.

1719
04:01:48,309 --> 04:02:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: There were papers were filed on some incidences, some incidences I did not report because she was scared of the consequences or how the children would react towards her because the bullying would be that much worse.

1720
04:02:04,730 --> 04:02:12,614
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter was also called a racist and a homophobic because she had a police bag hung in her bedroom.

1721
04:02:14,395 --> 04:02:17,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was just doing a little TikTok dance.

1722
04:02:17,797 --> 04:02:24,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it was in the background of her bedroom, she was called those names.

1723
04:02:24,581 --> 04:02:26,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was shared all over social media.

1724
04:02:27,383 --> 04:02:30,705
[SPEAKER_03]: This had affected her emotionally, socially.

1725
04:02:30,985 --> 04:02:32,666
[SPEAKER_03]: She missed a ton of school.

1726
04:02:36,919 --> 04:02:40,282
[SPEAKER_03]: She, you know, is in therapy because of all this.

1727
04:02:44,025 --> 04:02:47,749
[SPEAKER_03]: She was also one time, was at a park with friends.

1728
04:02:48,770 --> 04:02:54,354
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an incident that happened outside of school, but these same bullies were at her school last year.

1729
04:02:56,196 --> 04:03:00,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was innocently sitting at a picnic table at a park.

1730
04:03:01,702 --> 04:03:12,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the bullies came and pulled her from behind and pulled her off the picnic table, started punching her in the neck and in the head.

1731
04:03:13,829 --> 04:03:24,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I filed a police report and they told me that they would notify the school to make them aware of this situation of this student.

1732
04:03:26,155 --> 04:03:29,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The bullying continued in school, walking in the halls,

1733
04:03:31,223 --> 04:03:39,608
[SPEAKER_03]: calling her, verbally abusing her, made her want to call me or go to the nurse's office and be dismissed.

1734
04:03:40,528 --> 04:03:42,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a constant battle.

1735
04:03:43,530 --> 04:03:49,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't, the first week of school, freshman year, was okay.

1736
04:03:50,413 --> 04:03:59,458
[SPEAKER_03]: My house was already on the market and I couldn't wait, honestly, to get out of here because

1737
04:04:01,638 --> 04:04:02,798
[SPEAKER_03]: She was suffering so much.

1738
04:04:04,719 --> 04:04:11,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, since I moved 18 miles away, she is happier.

1739
04:04:12,561 --> 04:04:16,183
[SPEAKER_03]: She suffers from non-epileptic seizures.

1740
04:04:16,823 --> 04:04:21,764
[SPEAKER_03]: She has not had any non-epileptic seizures since we have moved.

1741
04:04:23,245 --> 04:04:26,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seizures were caused from stress and anxiety.

1742
04:04:28,752 --> 04:04:34,817
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter now is no longer scared to go to school or have a fear of being in the bathroom anymore.

1743
04:04:35,378 --> 04:04:36,959
[SPEAKER_03]: That speaks volumes right there.

1744
04:04:38,220 --> 04:04:39,361

[SPEAKER_11]: Jessica, name and address of the record.

1751
04:05:19,765 --> 04:05:21,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Jessica Haley, 4 Lock Road.

1752
04:05:24,153 --> 04:05:26,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very sorry to the mom that was just up there.

1753
04:05:27,455 --> 04:05:29,015
[SPEAKER_20]: My heart breaks for you and your daughter.

1754
04:05:31,256 --> 04:05:41,040
[SPEAKER_20]: I listened tonight and I heard all the things that is gonna happen up at the high school to change kids behaviors.

1755
04:05:42,120 --> 04:05:50,064
[SPEAKER_20]: The one thing that I did not hear is what happens to the children if those behaviors do not change?

1756
04:05:51,181 --> 04:05:53,782
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are the consequences for the kids?

1757
04:05:54,622 --> 04:06:08,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if the kids know that, okay, you're not supposed to be in the halls, you're not supposed to be in the bathrooms, you can't do this, you can't do that, they need to know what happens to them if they do go in the hallways and they don't have their passes.

1758
04:06:08,646 --> 04:06:18,469
[SPEAKER_20]: If they are all in the bathroom together, if they're not listening to the teachers and the principals, they have to know that there's gonna be a consequence to their actions.

1759
04:06:19,349 --> 04:06:24,451
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is something I have not heard anyone state of what the consequences are going to be.

1760
04:06:25,551 --> 04:06:28,872
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's something that as a parent, I would like to know.

1761
04:06:29,532 --> 04:06:30,873
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure many others would too.
