1
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,144
All right, thank you, Mrs. Lindsey.

2
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:13,506
Still with guests, friends, family, welcome to the City of Medford's Patriots Day Ceremony.

3
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,187
As previously stated, my name is Michael Durham.

4
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:21,268
After five years of active duty military service, my family and I have returned home to Medford.

5
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:25,710
This is home for both myself and my wife, Brianna.

6
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:29,993
In fact, we're high school sweethearts up at Medford High.

7
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:35,735
We got married shortly after college and went on active duty together and bounced around the nation and the world.

8
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:37,675
So, it's nice to be back.

9
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:42,077
We have both sets of grandparents here in the crowd today.

10
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,677
When we left, there were only two of us.

11
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:45,818
Now that we're back home, there's now four.

12
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47,238
So, plus two grandkids.

13
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:48,679
I know they're happy that we're around.

14
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,400
And I'm happy, too, to have our roots back in our hometown.

15
00:00:54,215 --> 00:01:08,998
So, you know, I was a little intimidated by coming out today and doing a public speech, especially performing at the level of professional public speakers like the mayor, Councilman Del Russo, who will talk to you today.

16
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:15,360
And then I remembered that 90% of my target audience was already dead and buried, thanks to our location.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,280
So I really shouldn't worry too much.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,841
It's a good place to shake the rust off.

19
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:27,214
Alright, like I said, just grateful to be here this morning.

20
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:32,616
I've been repeatedly told to cover my credentials, so please excuse the following list.

21
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:36,337
I usually like to be more modest, so bear with me.

22
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:44,720
Alright, my first duty assignment was to the 4th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,142
all the way for all you paratroopers out there.

24
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:54,507
I was a platoon leader for a parachute recon platoon from 2011 to 2013.

25
00:01:56,128 --> 00:02:02,012
During which time I deployed to Kandahar and Helmand provinces in Afghanistan in the year 2012.

26
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,256
Conducted over 14 air assault operations.

27
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:21,469
And due to our troop success, we ended up winning a Valorous Unit Award, and also the Draper Award, which is the award for best reconnaissance organization in the 18th Airborne Corps, which encompasses a quarter million soldiers.

28
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,770
So, that's something to be said.

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:35,893
When we returned home in 2013, I ensured that the unit was ready for 18-hour, no-notice, worldwide deployment by parachute assault as part of the United States Global Reaction Force.

30
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:44,433
We were on our tiptoes there for a second with the Syrian civil war going on, so I was fortunate not to jump into Syria in 2013.

31
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:55,929
At the end of 2013, I developed a true standard operating procedure for multi-echelon training and command post operations, and was rated as the best lieutenant in the squadron.

32
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:08,698
Due to my success, I was laterally transferred within the brigade to take over the platoon leader position for the multi-sensor signal intelligence and electronic warfare platoon in 2014.

33
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:12,421
That makes me an expert in all ground-based signals intelligence.

34
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:20,486
I ran the most effective single ground unit in the 82nd Airborne Division, as confirmed by NSA training records in 2014.

35
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:31,634
At which point I was PCSed in my second duty assignment at Fort Chica, Arizona, where I was an executive officer for Bravo Company 304th Military Intelligence Battalion.

36
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:40,760
At which case, I managed the organizational equipment for my company, worth over $130 million, to include 11 reconnaissance aircraft.

37
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:51,951
I ensured my company was logistically sound in order to allow 23 Army forces to function, and we ended up training over 3,000 officers, soldiers, and airmen that year.

38
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,695
My military education includes

39
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:14,260
Air Assault School, Airborne School, Armor Officer Basic Leadership Course, Army Reconnaissance Course, Contracting Officer Representative and Field Ordering Officer Courses, Low Level Voice Intercept Course, Profit and Stag Operations Training, I think NSA related activities.

40
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:25,084
the Intelligence Officer Transition Course, Military Intelligence Captain's Career Course, Weapons Intelligence Course, and the Master Gunner Electronic Warfare Signal Jamming Course.

41
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:29,326
So, now that that's over, thank goodness.

42
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:30,487
Yeah, I'm sorry.

43
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:37,770
We can actually sit down and talk about patriots today.

44
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,168
What do I believe Patriot's Day is a celebration of?

45
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,769
Patriot's Day, for those of you who don't know, is a state holiday.

46
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,370
It's only celebrated in three states.

47
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,411
Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Maine.

48
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:56,154
It commemorates the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord, which were the first battles of the American Revolutionary War.

49
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:03,616
This holiday was originally celebrated on April 19th, which is the actual anniversary of the battle of 1775.

50
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:15,021
However, since 1969, it was moved to 3rd Monday in April, which also coincides with Marathon Monday, Boston Marathon.

51
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:20,927
So, for all of you who like to play trivia at Buffalo Wild Wings, now you'll be able to get those questions.

52
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,241
I believe that everybody in the crowd has a basic understanding of what occurred in the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775.

53
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:41,504
But, in summary, for those who don't know, the Massachusetts colonial militiamen were able to successfully defend their weapons caches against a raid by the British Army Expeditionary Force from Boston.

54
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:48,145
So, why should this event be significant to us here today, hundreds of years later?

55
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:55,575
Well, those men and women were a group of people standing up against political injustice.

56
00:05:56,436 --> 00:06:02,821
Today is the day of remembrance for those brave enough to stand up and fight for the opportunity to be involved in their system of governance.

57
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:12,969
Since the first battle of the Revolutionary War, hundreds of thousands of Americans have died to maintain this right of independence and self-governance.

58
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,773
Today is the day to reflect upon that sacrifice.

59
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:25,468
We honor those who have gone before us by involving ourselves in the processes of our government, local, state, and federal.

60
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:32,272
We need to ensure that we're educated on the issues that affect our lives and the lives of our children.

61
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:37,215
How do we prioritize what is important if we're not situationally aware?

62
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:44,800
How do we ensure that our elected representatives are actioning what we want done if we are not educated

63
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:48,349
and involved in our own system of government.

64
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,453
Sorry kids, I'm almost done.

65
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:57,300
Today is the day to honor those brave Americans who have gone before us and secured our rights.

66
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,943
Ensure that you get registered to vote.

67
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:02,606
Get educated on the issues.

68
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,011
Honor the memory of those who have gone before you.

69
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,272
Get involved in your government.

70
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,033
That's what I believe Patriot Day is for.

71
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:17,997
All right, so, without further ado, I know this is a little bit winded, so we're gonna move on to better speakers.

72
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:24,660
We're now gonna hear the Pledge of Allegiance by the Medford Girl Scouts and Medford Boy Scouts.

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,364
And simultaneously, or immediately thereafter, excuse me, the Star Spangled Banner will be played by the Medford High School Band.

74
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:40,574
I'll ask all uniformed servicemen in the crowd to present the proper hand salute during the Pledge of Allegiance.

75
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:45,015
And for everyone else, please ensure that you're standing, if at all possible, your hand over your heart.

76
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:46,255
All right, thank you.

77
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,876
Member Girl Scouts, please take it away.

78
00:07:50,776 --> 00:08:03,240
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

79
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,074
♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪

80
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,133
Oh, I see him now.

81
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:49,914
I found him.

82
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,858
All right, that was fantastic.

83
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,799
Thank you.

84
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,520
All right, next we'll have the Concord Hymn by Ralph Waldo Emerson, which will be read by Ellie Hunt.

85
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:48,661
She's a sixth grade student at the Isara School.

86
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:54,142
By the rude bridge that arced the flood, their flags and ankles breathed unfurled.

87
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,223
Here once the embattled farmer stood,

88
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,895
and fire has shot her down the world.

89
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:04,338
The foe of silence sits in silent sleep.

90
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:13,205
A light could calm her in silent sleep, and time the ruined bridge has swept down the dark stream with seaward creeps.

91
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:23,251
On this green bank by the soft stream, we set today a golden stone that memory made indeed for me remain.

92
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:40,557
We, when, like our sires, our sons are gone, spirit that made those heroes dare, to die and leave their children free, the time and nature gently spare, the shaft we raise to them and thee.

93
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:47,322
Thank you, that was excellent.

94
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:56,502
Next will be the invocation by Reverend Lambert Brandon, who's the community minister for the Sanctuary of United Church of Christ.

95
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:56,822
Reverend.

96
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,547
Let us pray.

97
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:14,538
Gracious God of majesty, mercy, and mystery, we call upon your spirit to be with us in a special way.

98
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:26,081
We call upon you to, on this day of tradition and celebration, to show yourself to us, through us.

99
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,223
And so we invoke your spirit of community.

100
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:45,372
Thank you now for the families, friends, neighbors, visitors, daisies, brownies, juniors, Medford high students, and Medford baseball,

101
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:51,456
players for being here and participating in this occasion.

102
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,118
We invoke your spirit of safety.

103
00:11:56,099 --> 00:12:07,325
Thank you now for our firefighters, police officers, first responders, and all those who are vigilant and keep watch.

104
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,048
We invoke your spirit of leadership.

105
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:21,544
Thanking you now for our community organizers, our city officials, and especially our mayor.

106
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:27,325
May she continue to lead us in diligence and with discernment.

107
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,986
And we invoke your spirit of fun.

108
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,347
Thanking you now for

109
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,742
the entertainment and the excitement that will energize us to smile and to laugh.

110
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:52,803
But most of all, may this time be one of happiness, joy, and great mirth.

111
00:12:53,724 --> 00:13:00,205
For today, we are not only Boston strong, but we are indeed Medford strong.

112
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:12,710
And God, as we remember on this day, the shout heard all around the world, may this be the prayer heard all around your heaven.

113
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,973
It is in love that we live, move, and have our being.

114
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:23,737
And it is in the name of love that we pray this humble prayer.

115
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:24,917
Amen.

116
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:42,887
Next will be our guest introductions and Governor Baker's Patriot's Day Proclamation by our Mayor, Stephanie Burke.

117
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:53,535
Thank you Lieutenant Durham and all for participating in this morning's remembrance.

118
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:58,358
This could not have been possible without the many people that coordinated this event today.

119
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:06,956
Officer Ernest Lindsay, the DPW, police, baseball, softball, everyone that's around us in the van.

120
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,220
So thank you all so much for contributing to today's events.

121
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:17,250
Also, including your local officials, we have State Senator Pat Jalen.

122
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,733
Committee members Gally Kress and Roberts Gehry.

123
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:51,528
We know how meaningful this day is in the pursuit and preservation of our liberties.

124
00:14:52,188 --> 00:15:09,006
As John F. Kennedy said, let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and success of liberty.

125
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:18,490
May this fine city of ours live and breathe in its humble but proud roots, its vast diversity, and its devotion to a compassionate future.

126
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,052
This liberty we speak of forever rests here in the city of Medford, our home.

127
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:26,793
And with that being said, I'd like to read Governor Baker's proclamation.

128
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:28,414
Bear with me.

129
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,382
to come off of Massachusetts, a proclamation.

130
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:48,891
Whereas, throughout the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere and William Dawes rode through the countryside from Boston to Concord, informing the local militia that the British had mobilized and were headed to seize and destroy militia weapons and ammunition in Concord.

131
00:15:49,651 --> 00:16:05,681
And, whereas, by the early morning of April 19, 1775, the local Minutemen and the British Army had gathered on the Lexington Green, where the shocker around the world was fired, and eight Minutemen were killed, thus resulting in a retreat that the British continued on to conquer.

132
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:16,949
And whereas at Concord's North Bridge a skirmish broke out which caused the first British casualties and an attempted British retreat back to Boston that failed as a result of Minuteman resistance.

133
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,134
And whereas the battles of Lexington and Concord marked the beginning of the long struggle for American independence from Britain.

134
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:29,799
And whereas today we remember and pay tribute to the patriots who gave their lives in pursuit of liberty and independence.

135
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:46,116
Now, therefore, I, Charles D. Baker, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, do hereby proclaim April 18, 2016 to be Patriots Day and urge all the citizens of the Commonwealth to take cognizance of this event and participate fittingly in its observance.

136
00:16:46,917 --> 00:17:03,150
given at the Executive Chamber in Boston the first day of April in the year 2016, and of the independence of the United States of America this 239th by His Excellency Charles Baker, Lieutenant Governor Solito, and William Francis Galvin, our Secretary of State.

137
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,111
Thank you all.

138
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:24,967
Next, the Battle Hymn of the Republic will be played by the Montgomery High School Band.

139
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,740
Excellent job.

140
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,102
Now we'll listen to City Councilman President Fred DelRusso as he gives his Patriot's Day remarks.

141
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:58,846
241 years ago, it was 12 by the village o'clock when he crossed the bridge into MetroTown.

142
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:21,107
He heard the crowing of the cock and the barking of the farmer's dog, and felt the damp of the river flood that rises after the sun goes down.

143
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,010
Well, we're finally fixing that bridge.

144
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:31,955
That held a significant role in the foundation of our nation.

145
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:37,220
Local patriots, people who were inspired by freedom,

146
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:52,164
peace and prosperity, the opportunity to live fruitful lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor, stood up and were ready to take their place in what would happen.

147
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,305
It wasn't easy.

148
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,167
It took time, blood, sweat, and tears.

149
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:00,888
But it got done.

150
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:09,483
They built something which would speak to the ages, a new nation, a new community of people.

151
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:16,925
As rumor has it, Paul Revere just didn't pass through Memphis Square.

152
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:25,168
He had a drink in the home of a local distiller and the captain of Memphis militia, Isaac Hall.

153
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:29,770
He stopped in the square.

154
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,827
Now, if anybody was in a hurry to pass through the square, it was he.

155
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,768
What a precedent, he said.

156
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:39,390
A precedent we need to follow.

157
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,993
The revolutionary impulse wasn't shared by all.

158
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:48,455
In fact, some people had it pretty good here, and some were just comfortable in their ways.

159
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:56,060
But as we reflect on our national roots today, let us consider our desire to build anew.

160
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:05,428
our commitment to forging new bonds of community where newcomers and old settlers work together towards common greatness.

161
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:12,972
As we did capitalize on what Metro Square had to offer, let us do the same.

162
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:25,380
Building on good work done in years past, harvesting the desire in our citizens' hearts, may we continue on our plans to renew and build for the ages.

163
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,663
Next will be American Beautiful and also flags will be placed at the graves.

164
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:49,866
It will be done by Medford High School band along with the Medford Girl Scouts and the Medford Boy Scouts.

165
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:57,950
So without further ado.

166
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:29,331
May you be with us on this day of great joy, this day of great triumph.

167
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:49,362
and this day of remembrance.

168
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:50,524
Amen.

169
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:13,170
A special thanks goes out to the Zinnia Medford's electrical division for coming out today and allowing us to have this event.

170
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,172
It wouldn't have been possible without that division.

171
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:18,496
Thank you for all the city workers who came out early and set this up for us.

172
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:32,394
So, to conclude our ceremony, we'll hear God Bless America and then TAPS by the Bedford High School band.

173
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:36,377
For TAPS, uniformed personnel, please render the appropriate salute.

174
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:41,541
No further ado, band, you got it.

175
00:25:55,044 --> 00:26:08,911
and it's always raining.

176
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:21,885
uh

177
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,082
Thank you everyone for attending the first part of today's events at the East Elm Street Burial Ground.

178
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,013
Hey guys.

179
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:45,036
How are you?

180
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:46,099
Good, great.

181
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,027
All right, I think he has a message for us.

182
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,388
I'm going to hand him the mic.

183
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:33,072
An important message from Paul Revere.

184
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:35,113
Oh, no, he's running in.

185
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:35,794
There he goes.

186
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:50,223
Here they are, everybody.

187
00:29:50,503 --> 00:29:51,884
Let's hear it for Paul Revere.
