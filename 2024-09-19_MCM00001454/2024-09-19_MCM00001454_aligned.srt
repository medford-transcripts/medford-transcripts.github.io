Nicole Morrell.

12
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,123
President, I also can't change my name, so sorry.

13
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:09,326
I don't know why that's still coming up like that.

14
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:13,329
Maria Dorsey.

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,010
Here.

16
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:15,571
Marissa Desmond.

17
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,234
Absent.

18
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:18,954
Luke Preissner.

19
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:28,522
Okay, so we have one, two, three, four present, one absent.

20
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:29,363
We have a quorum.

21
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,525
Hello, Dr. Edward Vincent.

22
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,093
Hello, I thought it was a separate link.

23
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:36,914
So I did too.

24
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,395
I signed off and back in.

25
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,837
So I did the same thing.

26
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:50,943
So for this group, I did want to introduce Will formally and give him a minute to introduce himself because we will be working really closely with Will.

27
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:52,584
So welcome.

28
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:54,765
Will, did you want to introduce yourself?

29
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:56,695
Yeah, absolutely.

30
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:57,416
So hello, everyone.

31
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:58,696
My name is Wilfred Pacelli.

32
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:01,877
I joined the team here in Medford around late July.

33
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,959
So catching myself up to speed with all things Medford, really happy to see.

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,920
The students are back in our buildings.

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,241
It's been so nice to kind of see them throughout the hallways and whatnot.

36
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:15,563
We're very happy to be part of this project as well.

37
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:23,526
Being able to build the high school and create a space for so many generations of students is a really great opportunity in the fact that

38
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:27,848
you know, I get to be part of it pretty much from day one, it's super exciting.

39
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:36,573
So really happy to be here, looking forward to working with everyone in this call, as well as the other members of the committee that we were just hanging out with on the last call.

40
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,474
So looking forward to it and can't wait to get started.

41
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,035
Thanks Will.

42
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:50,126
So Will and I have, as I mentioned in the last meeting, been working behind the scenes to sort of make some of those submissions a little bit more digestible.

43
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:56,909
All the credit to Will for doing a really fabulous job and doing it in a really quick turnaround kind of way.

44
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:57,709
So thank you.

45
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:05,492
And we will post those out on the website and make them available for people.

46
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:19,039
I think the maintenance and capital planning document is dry reading because it's about maintenance and capital planning, which is inherently not that exciting.

47
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:30,585
But there's actually a lot of really great information in there about how the district is moving forward around maintenance,

48
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:37,107
Um, our custodial services, um, we have a green cleaning plan.

49
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:43,089
We have a. Ongoing preventive maintenance plan.

50
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:49,912
Um, we have a lot of things now that are documented that, you know, well, that was not always the case.

51
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:53,533
So it's nice to be able to sort of showcase all of those things.

52
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,834
And 1, like, cohesive package.

53
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:13,649
The other thing that's really enlightening about that document, I think, is when you look at some of the capital planning questions that the MSBA posed, they asked questions like, how big is your maintenance budget?

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,911
And how big should it be?

55
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,855
If there's a gap, why is there a gap?

56
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:28,941
So they really are looking for people to be good stewards of their of their funding and they asked really good questions.

57
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:35,587
They asked us to break things down sometimes in ways that we don't break things down in our sort of universe here in Medford.

58
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,088
So that has led to some conversations about.

59
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,991
Breaking things down differently in the future, which I think is all good stuff.

60
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:48,974
And then the, the, the other document about the enrollment projection, I thought was very enlightening.

61
00:04:49,674 --> 00:05:03,241
That 1 took a lot of work to come together cohesively because they were seemingly very desperate, desperate things that had to be covered and we were able to, I think, do a good job of sharing.

62
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:19,346
in that document everything that we've provided to MSBA about our plans and some of the things that we see coming down the line and ultimately a justification for a building size for 1,500 students plus 200 pre-k students and I think another 100 kids corner

63
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:46,654
Early childhood folks, so children, so the total enrollment we put forward was 1800, which includes 1500 high school, 200 pre K programming and then 100 for kids going.

64
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,737
To sort of comprise everything that is in the building.

65
00:05:52,228 --> 00:06:01,457
So it's sort of interesting to dig in there and see some of the information that we provided them, particularly if you've ever wondered, like, what are we doing in housing in Medford?

66
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:07,282
It's like a nice handy summary of those things, because we really had to boil it up to provide it to MSBA.

67
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:17,829
So we'll get those out on the website, but I did want to have some space on the agenda in case there was anything else that you all were thinking about for the website.

68
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,651
Now that we have will on board, he'll be taking the reins on that.

69
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,592
So I just wanted to open it up to the group.

70
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:32,638
I know there's not been tons of conversation of late in the community about this project, because we've got other big things to talk about as a community.

71
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,141
And I think that that will continue through November.

72
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:44,328
But I think just as soon as that's done and we're sort of moving on to those next gates, this will become all the conversation.

73
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:51,834
So I did want to set aside just a little bit of time for us to think about some of the planning exercises to be ready for that.

74
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:56,878
Does anybody have any questions, comments about the website, Luke?

75
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:58,960
Sure.

76
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,143
So earlier on the other meeting, we talked about an OPM.

77
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,429
Currently, we're sort of cash-constrained.

78
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,950
We have a short timeline.

79
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:15,293
We should have realistic sort of design goals for what our website contains.

80
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:21,937
Personally, I prefer substance over pizzazz, but at some point, there's going to be

81
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:31,751
a need actually for Pizazz to kind of present the project in its best light, make navigation, looking for information convenient, all those things.

82
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,672
So back to the OPM.

83
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:47,477
When we select an OPM, is there a sort of responsibility that they have for organizing kind of a professional website, which is

84
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,582
common to all of these school building projects.

85
00:07:51,583 --> 00:08:00,869
Yeah, I do believe that they play heavily in that space as well as in general in this community engagement space.

86
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:08,994
They will help drive some of the community engagement events that happen as we get into the design phase and that kind of thing.

87
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:13,878
I think for the near term,

88
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:18,759
prior to forming the project team, prior to awarding a feasibility study.

89
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,520
It makes sense to prioritize substance.

90
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:29,062
Certainly, I think there's been a good start made by Will's predecessor, Will Walkum.

91
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:39,926
I see useful documents there, and I think adding the documents that were shared earlier today is a continuation of that pattern.

92
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,186
I think building out

93
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:57,162
uh, you know, the content, um, and having a good starting point for when it's taken over by, uh, um, sort of a more resourced and, um, you know, a contractor in that field.

94
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,063
Um, it should be our goal.

95
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,084
Um, so, uh, just thanks for expressing an opinion.

96
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:05,684
Yeah, thank you for that.

97
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,325
Um, any other

98
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:10,269
Questions, comments, thoughts about the website?

99
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,409
I know it's just been quiet at the moment.

100
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,230
Maria?

101
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:14,710
Yeah.

102
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,671
At one point, we did talk about having some kind of a video.

103
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:30,834
And I did speak with the instructors that are in our film and TV production classes at the VOC.

104
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,655
And they are very excited about

105
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:43,367
having the students involved in possibly doing a tour of the school, showing some of the deficits that might, you know, help our case in selling this to the public.

106
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:51,637
And as far as a timeline, I told them that I felt that it was a little bit away, a distance away where we'd need that.

107
00:09:52,538 --> 00:10:06,104
They're excited to get started now so that it gives them plenty of time to include things, to work with us on what we wanna see, what you wanna see in that film as well.

108
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:08,805
So they are a go and they're excited about it.

109
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,346
So I was very, very happy about that.

110
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,446
Great.

111
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,547
Have they seen the old one?

112
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,508
The one from 1970, the year the school opened?

113
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,829
Yes, that's amazing.

114
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,010
It's funny too.

115
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,757
So I will, I will.

116
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:45,180
take a look through some of the model OPM procurement documents to figure out, like, where do they fit, I guess I'll say, in the process of, like, doing some of this work around PR, just to make sure that we have, like, sort of an understanding of that.

117
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,482
But I don't think there's really any reason why they couldn't get started in advance of that.

118
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:53,183
I just want to double check, and Maria, I will follow up with you and let you know.

119
00:10:56,897 --> 00:11:00,919
Um, okay, so the other thing I wanted to sort of circle back to that.

120
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,881
We talked about back in June was.

121
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:11,224
2 updates to surveys that we were going to do, and I wanted to sort of bring will into the fold.

122
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:17,487
We had some conversation about doing a survey to all of our boards and commissions.

123
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:22,230
So, Medford has, like, I don't know, 20 or 30 boards and commissions.

124
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,752
Well, and they all have different, probably different.

125
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:32,075
Sort of attachments and levels of interest in the in the high school project.

126
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,917
Some probably have a very high interest in a lot of things about the project.

127
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:41,739
Others may have just sort of fleeting interest or want to know different things.

128
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:42,079
So.

129
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:54,385
We did talk about creating a survey for the boards and commissions to try to get a feel for and an understanding of, like, where best to plug them all into the process.

130
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:58,426
And I wanted to check in with this group.

131
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:03,989
I actually think now is good timing to put that survey together.

132
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:11,451
And we do have questions from our last meeting and give them some time in the next, like, 6 weeks or so to get back to us.

133
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,901
so that we can be prepared with that information.

134
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:34,069
On the flip side, the FAQ survey I have a little bit of a different opinion about, but I wanted to talk to this group about that timing, and whether you think that's the right timing for boards and commissions, and whether there's any reason for us not to pursue that in the next two months or so.

135
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,171
I wanted to clarify the scope of the interaction with the boards and commissions.

136
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:49,099
Do you intend to engage with them in a structured way where you prepare a questionnaire ahead of time?

137
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,361
Or is it more organic where you go to them and you ask, do you have any questions?

138
00:12:54,841 --> 00:13:05,305
You record the responses, you do that for all the boards and commissions, see what comes up over and over and do your best to answer the questions.

139
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:15,231
No, we actually had established some questions in 1 of our last meetings to actually push out a formal survey so that we can get some standard responses.

140
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,471
And I think if I'm remembering correctly, 1 of the questions is.

141
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:23,733
Do you want somebody from the building committee to come present to you about the project?

142
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,394
Like, will that would that be helpful for you?

143
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,655
And if so, like, what is your meeting schedule and that kind of thing?

144
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:45,762
And then we probably will have to do some descriptor of, like, what we see the process as so that they can say, you know, this is how I think I can be helpful to this project, or this is the kind of input or place in the process that I would like to.

145
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:50,745
So it's questions like that to help us frame, like, when we should be reaching out to them.

146
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,185
Does that make sense?

147
00:13:52,345 --> 00:14:07,108
And, of course, like, welcome their other questions, but it is a, it is like a defined survey set of, like, 4 or 5 questions so that we can get a consistent response from them and then figure out how we proceed once we have it.

148
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:10,109
I'd like a copy of the questions.

149
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,270
I may have seen them before, but it's, you know.

150
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:18,430
Well, I think we talked about them in our last meeting.

151
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,391
Yeah.

152
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:26,373
We can certainly pull those back up and Will and I will work on that and put something together.

153
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:35,958
Will, we will send a copy to this group so that you know what those questions are and if there's any comments, you can let us know.

154
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:38,279
Yeah.

155
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:42,141
I am attached on documents, so I got them right in front of me.

156
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,297
Okay, we just they're on the notes from the last meeting right yeah yeah yeah i'm looking at right now so.

157
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,385
They make sense to me and.

158
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:07,039
I think the timing is very good too, because people are just gearing up in the fall season, and I don't think everybody is inundated yet.

159
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:18,008
So if you give them a relatively short turnaround time, I think when I say relatively short, I think six weeks is probably a little long.

160
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:33,197
And then the results would be in before people start to worry about the holidays coming and groups that meet every other month that may have to delay things for that reason as well.

161
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,780
I like the speed of how you're looking at it.

162
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:45,925
The other survey that we talked about was a survey around

163
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:55,482
The so really to start to ask the community, what are the kinds of questions you have about this project given.

164
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:13,395
Given that we have a lot of other hot topics related to schools going on in the community right now, I'm of the mind that we should defer pushing that survey out until mid to late November.

165
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:26,639
And that with a goal of being able to put some of those FAQs up by the end of the year, I think it will get lost in the noise if we try to do anything sooner than that.

166
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,280
Does everyone agree with that approach?

167
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:29,711
I agree.

168
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:36,414
And not only will I get lost in noise, but I would assume we would get people saying they want answers to questions related to the other things happening.

169
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,495
Yeah, yeah, I think so, too.

170
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,515
Yeah, I think there'd be a lot of entanglement.

171
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:50,019
But I do think that having a community sourced FAQ is a better choice for many reasons than

172
00:16:52,573 --> 00:17:01,038
more of a directed FAQ where we just kind of cut and paste from other school building project pages and kind of make a super list.

173
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,441
That's more of us talking to people or, you know, instructing people.

174
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:10,304
And I don't think that that's really what people want.

175
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:19,109
I think having the survey and truly pulsing community services is the best foundation for the FAQs.

176
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,430
And I agree with your timing.

177
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:24,735
Cool, so, um, so we'll.

178
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:40,962
I think roughly speaking, we'll plan to meet at some point after, like, in the mid November timeframe, if we can, like, will and I will can draft up the survey to be able to push out.

179
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:44,183
We can review it together and then make a plan to push it out.

180
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,504
So I think for this group, maybe the next time we meet can be.

181
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,226
You know, mid to late November, like, mid November ish.

182
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,742
post-election.

183
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:56,489
Does that work for everybody?

184
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:58,854
Mm-hmm.

185
00:17:59,575 --> 00:17:59,796
OK.

186
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:00,657
Makes sense to me.

187
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,281
Perfect.

188
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:07,937
Um, and then the other thing that, um, I do think.

189
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:24,191
I would like for us to work on and it can, it can come from the, I think, from the district, maybe as an attachment, Dr Edward Benson to your weekly email is just an update on where we are something sort of brief that says we're done with our deliverables.

190
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,572
You can find them all here.

191
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:33,497
Um, and, you know, the next step is this and we await that we await information from on taking that next step.

192
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:39,060
And in the meantime, we'll be coming to you to solicit questions and stay tuned for that.

193
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,882
So, something along that line, so that people have an understanding of what's going.

194
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:48,170
Yeah, we can definitely add that to the weekly memo.

195
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,279
And MSBA is actually doing a new logo contest.

196
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,884
So they've been emailing me and our students

197
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:04,009
They want to rebrand, and it's going to be a new logo for MSBA.

198
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:06,271
So our students, Ms.

199
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:14,097
Suzanne Fee, our director of arts, is going to be working with students to design potential logos for MSBA.

200
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:18,100
And that's from September 16 until November 22.

201
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,003
So we have such wonderful arts programming.

202
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:23,685
I am keeping my fingers crossed.

203
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:32,389
that maybe one of our students designs will be selected for the new logo for MSBA, which would be fabulous for us.

204
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:41,493
So we can definitely put an MSBA update though in this week's update, Friday's message.

205
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:44,754
It may not be ready for this week, but maybe next week.

206
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,035
Okay, perfect.

207
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:46,555
Okay.

208
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:50,313
And that was it.

209
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,493
That's all I had for this group.

210
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,934
So it actually was a quick, short meeting again.

211
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:56,334
So thank you guys for joining.

212
00:19:57,395 --> 00:20:01,295
Are there any other questions before we adjourn?

213
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,356
No, I just wanted to say welcome, Will.

214
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:07,376
I'm actually also a URI journalism grad.

215
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:07,956
I looked you up.

216
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:09,577
So you're in good company.

217
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:10,697
Nice.

218
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:11,537
Go, Rhody.

219
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:12,297
Go, Rhody.

220
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,958
Is there a motion to adjourn?

221
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,742
So moved by Nicole, seconded by?

222
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,183
Seconded, Maria.

223
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:25,604
Maria?

224
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,086
OK, roll call.

225
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:28,446

226
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:28,986
Yes.

227
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:30,767

00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:33,409
Yes.

231
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:34,290
Will?

232
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,330
Sorry, not Will.

233
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:36,431

234
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:42,575
Yes, Luke?

235
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:43,756
Yes.

236
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,417
OK.

237
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,318
And Marissa Desmond?

238
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,295
Absent, okay.

239
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,258
Four in the affirmative, one absent.

240
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,139
The meeting is adjourned.

241
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,861
Thank you, everyone.
