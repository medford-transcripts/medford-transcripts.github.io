1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:00,972
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:10,958
Welcome to the June 13th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

3
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,039
Okay.

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,021
So I want to try to get through everything tonight.

5
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:20,665
So the first thing on our agenda is the minutes from June 6th.

6
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:22,686
Did everyone have a chance to look at them?

7
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:26,409
Are we good with those?

8
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:37,098
Nova, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but you probably have access to the artificial intelligence secretary that takes notes of meetings.

9
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,680
Oh, I never even thought about doing that.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,760
I've actually used them for meetings.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,121
And surprisingly, the things that it writes are very accurate.

12
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,262
You just go in and edit to clean them up.

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,502
But it may be something to try out.

14
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,383
Thanks for that tip.

15
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:53,143
I may do that.

16
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,984
We're almost done.

17
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:56,444
It's very impressive.

18
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,605
I just learned about it.

19
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:58,525
I wasn't hiding.

20
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:01,454
Can I ask a question?

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,095
I'm trying to get into my iPad and I can't.

22
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,898
I don't have the meeting ID number anywhere.

23
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm on my phone.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,584
Can someone give me the meeting ID number or forward it to me or whatever?

25
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,666
Is there someone who can do that quickly and text it to Maury?

26
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,108
I can do that, Milva.

27
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,569
Thank you so much.

28
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,991
The minutes.

29
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:32,618
I'm abstaining, I wasn't there, but.

30
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:33,679
Does someone want to move?

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,039
Okay, second?

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Second.

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,701
Okay, all in favor?

34
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:38,942
Aye.

35
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:39,622
Aye.

36
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,584
Okay, so minutes are approved.

37
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:43,124
Okay.

38
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:43,824
Paul, it's here.

39
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:48,687
Yes, so we have a lot of issues to go through.

40
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,609
So we'll start, we'll just go through the agenda.

41
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,812
Um, we'll go through that they're in the order that they are on the agenda.

42
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:03,333
First was the residency requirement for multi-member bodies.

43
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:10,717
So that was something that somebody, does someone want to say something?

44
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:19,650
Um, yeah, I noticed looking to article 9 and I'm kind of the 1 that's responsible for a lot of this stuff.

45
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,454
I noticed that we have 2 section 2.

46
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:40,501
I think in our copy, 9-1 is charter changes, 9-2 is severability, and then we have another 9-2, which should probably become 9-3 and then continue sequentially.

47
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,383
I don't want to change.

48
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:51,384
The, the article that you've got article nine and that we're not, that's not a draft that we were going to use for our charter.

49
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:58,670
It's basically was just sort of an example draft of things that go in article nine so that we can make the decisions about it.

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,752
And the Collins center will draft that and fix all that stuff.

51
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:09,458
Um, so in terms of the residency requirement, so, um,

52
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:20,906
What I did get a lot of notes from the call center this week on these questions and they said that it's not uncommon for there to be residency requirements.

53
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,348
I know last week when we talked about it.

54
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:27,673
There were certain concerns like what if somebody

55
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:37,351
who needed to be on a body, wasn't a resident, like the chief of police, for instance, or the building commissioner.

56
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:47,493
And Collins Center gave some example language that they felt would address those issues.

57
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,173
Did anyone have a chance to look at it?

58
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:54,994
They basically gave us an example from Fall River, an example from Northampton, and an example from Amesbury.

59
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,315
I like the one from Amesbury.

60
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:00,457
I agree.

61
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,481
I thought Ainsbury was the fairest and it does allow for those exceptions that we talked about as well.

62
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,822
So I like the Ainsbury choice.

63
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,484
Did everybody look at them?

64
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:13,925
Okay.

65
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,547
I actually don't know if I have them to call up right now.

66
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:22,771
If anybody, because I actually can't call up a Word doc on my laptop, but we won't get into that.

67
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,610
Yeah, let me see if I can find it and I can find it.

68
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,852
But everybody theoretically looked at these, right?

69
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,154
Yes.

70
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:51,286
So the one from Amesbury says that all appointed multi-member body members shall be residents of the city, but that that requirement can be waived by majority vote of the city council upon recommendation of the mayor.

71
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,870
So let's say the mayor, who is the appointing authority anyway, wants to waive that requirement.

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,632
the mayor has to go to the city council and they have to vote on it.

73
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:04,515
The mayor sets out the reasons why the waiver is in the best interest of the city.

74
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,176
Does that make sense?

75
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,416
It does make sense.

76
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:15,321
Yeah, I just put it in the chat.

77
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:20,805
There was the question of, do we want to put a residency requirement in?

78
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,065
If we do, we have

79
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:30,758
different examples, and it seems like the third example, the Amesbury example, is the one that people like.

80
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:32,819
Ron.

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:46,625
The one thing that I liked strongly is if multi-member bodies are not necessarily always appointed by the mayor.

82
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:53,147
So it may be the appointing authority that has the right to waive is my only thought.

83
00:05:54,544 --> 00:06:03,771
So you're saying instead of just being, you know, the city council comes up with a review board of whatever.

84
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:12,958
And there's somebody leaves the city, it makes sense to me that the city council has the right to waive that because they're the creating source.

85
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,720
That's the only thing that.

86
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:26,285
I mean, so the only boards that the mayor doesn't appoint are ones that are written into the ordinance or from mass journal law, right?

87
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,987
I mean, because the mayor has the power to appoint.

88
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:36,030
That's what the mayor has now, and that's what we have in our charter, in our draft charter.

89
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:42,714
So school committee and city council cannot establish a multi-member board?

90
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,055
I mean, I don't, I don't think so.

91
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,057
I mean, if that's the case, then that answers that question.

92
00:06:54,978 --> 00:07:03,462
I mean, there are, I think there might be some boards where like the city council appoints some people and the mayor appoints others, but those are the ones that are, um,

93
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,061
created by ordinance or mass general law or something?

94
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,541
I don't know.

95
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:12,222
Eunice, go ahead.

96
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:18,143
I mean, I think that what we're saying here, and particularly since we're using, is it Amesbury?

97
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:23,584
Amesbury, whoever, that we said is pretty fair.

98
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:33,026
It gives the out, certainly for the situations such as the chief of police or

99
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:44,291
building guy, building commissioner, things like that, gives an out for that.

100
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:57,538
But it would also give an out for, like I think Anthony may have been saying last week, the Board of Health for a doctor or something like that or other cases.

101
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:00,099
I think basically in my mind,

102
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:11,062
uh, except where required by law, like, I think it's the zoning board of appeals, um, or the community development board.

103
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:19,567
I, I can't remember which, um, the state, um, appoint somebody, uh, they're a Medford resident, but say to state does the appointing.

104
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:26,970
I think using the one that this sample that we have here, I think pretty much spells it out.

105
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,511
Whether any, any,

106
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:33,478
Multimember board, um, it should.

107
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,422
Be a Medford resident unless there's.

108
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,866
A very valid reason for it not to be.

109
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:48,335
You know, whether it be a case of, you know, the police chief on the human rights commission or whatever.

110
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:48,395
Or.

111
00:08:50,297 --> 00:09:01,680
And he's on there by virtue of his role in the city and he isn't required to live in the city versus somebody else's expertise.

112
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,061
We might tap for whatever reason and it gives the mayor the opportunity to do that.

113
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:18,485
I think whether it be a case of particular expertise or your stature or role in the community or the community garden commission or the bicycle commission or whatever,

114
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:22,866
Everybody should be a member of the city unless there's a really good reason not to be.

115
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,947
And I think that encapsulates it.

116
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,109
Any other comments or discussion on this point?

117
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,672
I just like to say, as long as there's some way for there to be an exemption,

118
00:09:40,824 --> 00:10:00,558
you know, special circumstance, I think it's, I can, I can agree with like to say, you know, we wanted to, uh, ask a Tufts professor that works in Medford, but isn't a method resident to be on, you know, a specific board or commission for, you know, for their expertise.

119
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:08,303
I think as long as the mayor can kind of, uh, somehow, uh, appeal the, uh,

120
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,502
I'm sorry, the things coming through, I'm getting some interference, but I'm okay with it.

121
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,704
I'm sorry, I'm breaking up.

122
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:22,866
No, but if you let me share, I can put it on the screen so people can see.

123
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:24,287
Okay.

124
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:28,729
We can do that.

125
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:31,591
I'm not, do people need to see it right now?

126
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:58,890
Jean was just sharing in the chat what are the 2-9 section that we wrote, which gives the mayor the authority to appoint the multi-member bodies and gives the city council the confirmation, the power to reject, say.

127
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:13,156
Do we want to move ahead with the Amesbury language, or what do people think?

128
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:19,079
I move to add a section on residency and use the Amesbury language.

129
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,620
OK.

130
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,381
Second.

131
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:26,482
Second.

132
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:27,883
OK.

133
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,884
OK, let's do a roll call.

134
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:30,704
Ron?

135
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:30,784
Yes.

136
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:34,718
Jean?

137
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:35,799
Yes.

138
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,600
Danielle?

139
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,520
Yes.

140
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:40,141
Eunice?

141
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:40,842
Yes.

142
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:42,522
Paulette?

143
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:43,183
Yes.

144
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:44,784
Phyllis?

145
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,344
Are you not sure?

146
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:46,785
Right.

147
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:47,485
Okay.

148
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,346
So Maury?

149
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:50,026
Yes.

150
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:52,728
Aubrey?

151
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:53,628
Yes.

152
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,750
Anthony?

153
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,717
I'm sorry, I'm breaking up again.

154
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,037
Yes, if you can hear me.

155
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:05,518
Okay, great.

156
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:06,858
And I'm voting yes.

157
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,138
Did I get everybody?

158
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:09,019
I think I did.

159
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,419
Okay, awesome.

160
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,720
So that is what did you vote on?

161
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:20,902
We voted on adding a residency requirement for multi member bodies.

162
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:41,366
So what we just voted was to add a residency requirement, but put language in that includes a waiver so that it could be waived with the mayor can take a waiver request to the city council to waive the residency requirement.

163
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:49,231
So it's not impossible that someone from outside the city could be on one of those boards, but there has to be a reason for it.

164
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:50,653
Yeah, okay.

165
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:51,333
I agree with that.

166
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:52,674
Okay.

167
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:55,147
OK, great.

168
00:12:56,348 --> 00:13:01,232
So Eunice, what was your question on the rules and regulations?

169
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:15,664
It was more of a kind of bringing the section into the 21st century.

170
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:16,844
Let me see if I can.

171
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,052
put it in the chat.

172
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:35,995
How it reads, and I'll put it in the chat in a minute.

173
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,916
Is this what you mean here?

174
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,737
Wait a minute.

175
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,678
I'm bouncing between a couple of different things.

176
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:46,818
What I just put on the screen?

177
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,379
No, I cleaned it up a little bit.

178
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,439
Apologies.

179
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,215
Let me see what it reads is.

180
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:55,916
Now, I can't find it.

181
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:29,842
A copy of all rules and regulations adopted by a city agency shall be published on the agency's designated page on the city website and placed on file in the office of the city clerk to be made available for review by any person who requests such information at a reasonable time, unless an emergency exists as determined by the mayor.

182
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:39,844
No rule or regulation adopted by a city agency shall become effective less than five days following the date it's filed.

183
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:46,246
So it more or less just sort of brings it into the 21st century.

184
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:55,468
Instead of being placed on file in the office of the city clerk, it's, you know, or we can add that piece too, but that

185
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:11,612
you know, each agency has a space on the city website as they basically do now, and any rules and regulations would be a part of their home on the city website, if that all makes sense.

186
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:14,133
Yeah.

187
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,474
Let me put it in the chat.

188
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:19,594
Okay.

189
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:24,216
Then I will share a little bit from my conversation with the Collins Center about this.

190
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:34,062
So their recommendation was not to be that specific because the public engagement changes.

191
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:42,466
And so, you know, let's say a charter review every 10 years, the means for public engagement change.

192
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:54,412
So they recommended just putting in language that was more general, like through all available means, or you could say through electronic means or something like that.

193
00:15:55,224 --> 00:16:00,608
Um, well, that was that was that was their feedback.

194
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,429
Are we talking about the same thing?

195
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:04,530
Section 93 rules and regulations?

196
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:11,275
Yeah, well, we were talking about basically any they were talking about any mention of.

197
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:28,345
putting requirements in the charter to put materials on the city website or, you know, in specific areas on the city website, because the means for public engagement can change over the period between charter meetings.

198
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:30,765
That was just their feedback.

199
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:31,185
Okay.

200
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,006
I see what you're saying.

201
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:43,228
The piece that I had an issue with was the placed on file in the office and available for reviews.

202
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:51,230
That means if you want something, you have to go in and ask the city clerk as opposed to bringing up city website and lo and behold.

203
00:16:51,830 --> 00:17:19,531
Yeah, so, and as I said, this is, you know, all I'm doing for Article 9 is telling the Holland Center what we want in it, and that they're going to put standard language in, and theoretically, they would use updated language, but we could say to them, we want this section to reflect the importance of materials being available to the public, you know, as specifically as possible, or something like that.

204
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:24,449
You know, electronic means part.

205
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:28,794
I just does that make sense?

206
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:29,715
Yeah, it does.

207
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:36,904
But 1 thing that worries me is that when you, if you put something like that in the chat of that specific, then you also like.

208
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,616
Are you making it accessible to all?

209
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,576
Like, are you putting it on the website?

210
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,577
No, the website isn't necessarily accessible to all people.

211
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:48,637
You know what I mean?

212
00:17:50,577 --> 00:18:02,199
But language or people, you know, blind people or people whose language is other than English or you need to have things translated.

213
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,420
If you make it that specific, you know,

214
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:21,052
how to, you know, what laws kind of guide that, you know, the, this, you know, our webpage isn't necessarily ADA, like ADA compatible and stuff.

215
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:24,334
So, just something to think about.

216
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:25,654
Okay.

217
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:26,354
Thank you.

218
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:26,914
Ron.

219
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:35,845
You know, to get a couple of things to Anthony's point, I think it says in there to be on file at the city clerk's office.

220
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:48,751
So I believe that the city clerk has a process in place for making sure that the media is available to everybody, whether impaired or doesn't speak the language, they would have to do that.

221
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,232
So I'm not I'm not.

222
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,634
I think it covers that the other piece is

223
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:08,804
I think we're talking about, we are talking about what Eunice is saying and what the Collins Center wrote was also about rules for public participation, too.

224
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:09,664
So.

225
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,966
Yeah, that's a different issue.

226
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:12,566
Yeah.

227
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:17,269
And the third thing is we have somebody who wants to comment on this subject.

228
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,910
Okay.

229
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,070
Yeah.

230
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,213
So we usually take public comment at the end, but I'm fine with taking it now.

231
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,334
So is everyone?

232
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:24,434
Yeah.

233
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:25,835
Okay.

234
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,162
I think Matthew wanted to speak.

235
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:33,883
You have to unmute.

236
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,564
Yeah, we can hear you.

237
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,145
Wait, you're breaking up.

238
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:45,846
Can you hear me?

239
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:47,267
We can hear you, but you're breaking up.

240
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,087
Yeah, you're breaking up.

241
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:54,348
Okay, thank you.

242
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,369
He's going to put it in the chat, I think he said.

243
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:03,511
Okay, so do we have any more discussion on this?

244
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:07,813
Do we have a resolution?

245
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,374
Well, does anybody have one?

246
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:22,378
I mean, what I was going to say was the move to ask the Collins Center to include language

247
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:39,063
that ensures information is shared through all available means and just sort of stress the importance of that.

248
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:42,505
Melva, I don't know if you saw Matthew's newest comment.

249
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,487
Yeah, I'm about to look at that.

250
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,329
Anyway, so that was my suggestion.

251
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,871
I don't know what he wants us to consider before the vote.

252
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:54,069
We'll wait.

253
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:10,058
So just to rephrase, I would move that we ask the call-in center to include language that ensures that information is shared through all available means with the public, shared with the public, all available means.

254
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,312
Does anybody want to second that?

255
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:21,653
I second it.

256
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:22,314
Yeah.

257
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:23,655
Okay.

258
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,097
But now, what is it that Matt wants?

259
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:26,437
Yeah.

260
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:26,817
I know.

261
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:37,887
He wants us to- I think he's probably typing, so give him a second maybe to see if there's something that- Okay.

262
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:41,429
Right.

263
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,711
Without request.

264
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:43,671
Yeah.

265
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:45,293
Okay.

266
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:57,808
So if we were going to include that, we're moving to ask the Council to include language that ensures info is shared with the public through all available means.

267
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,156
Are we placing a time limit on that?

268
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,582
Was there a five day something that someone said?

269
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:11,624
No, there's, I think there's.

270
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:29,395
It said at the end, unless an emergency exists as determined by the mayor, no rule or regulation adopted by a city agency shall become effective less than five days following the date it is filed.

271
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:34,378
So that's a little bit, it's sort of a secondary part to

272
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,300
having information, there's two parts to this.

273
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:47,263
It's having information available to the public, easily accessible for anybody that would want it.

274
00:22:50,964 --> 00:23:01,188
Then unless an emergency exists, no rule or regulation adopted by an agency shall become effective less than five days following the date it's filed.

275
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:02,628
Okay.

276
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,449
Can we take that piece separately?

277
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:05,543
Yeah.

278
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:06,343
Okay.

279
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:08,004
Frances, did you want to say something?

280
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:12,446
Frances?

281
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:13,886
She's muted.

282
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,507
I don't think she knows she's muted.

283
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,367
She just unmuted.

284
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:21,549
Please ensure that you have clarification with regards to what kind of information is available.

285
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:33,273
If somebody requests an ASL interpreter, if somebody requests large print, if somebody requests the use of an outside vendor, that information is not going to be available immediately.

286
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,214
it might not even be available at all.

287
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:44,038
Case in point, the Pride Festival, six week leeway to the MCDHH right on up until Tuesday.

288
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:50,801
So just be careful, you know, just a point of caution in terms of your wording, right?

289
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:56,424
Somebody could say, I'm going to need a blah, blah, blah language translator.

290
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,684
That's not something that happens in a house.

291
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:03,467
So I think you just have to provide clarification for that.

292
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:15,117
I think also, additionally, the expectations have to be clear, walking into a city clerk's office and saying, hey, I need this not going to happen right away, depending on what it is.

293
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,359
Now, if you're walking in and you're looking for the.

294
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:29,113
The things that are going to be discussed at, let's say, a city council meeting on that night, you're going to find them on the counter because they're all printed.

295
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:36,543
But if you're talking about something that was previous, that's going to require time for people to do the search.

296
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:47,832
So to keep those things in mind, and also, you know, folks needing to know where to go on the website to acquire, you know, to acquire information, right?

297
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:57,735
Some commissions drop in the draft notes as they're done, and other commissions wait until those notes are converted to minutes.

298
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:01,617
Okay, thank you.

299
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:01,997
Jean?

300
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:11,156
I just want to clarify for everyone that this is just about the rules and regulations that the city promulgates.

301
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:15,260
So it's ordinances, policies from city agencies.

302
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,242
It doesn't include minutes.

303
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:23,468
This is just relevant to at least by the heading in the text.

304
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:25,070
That's what it pertains to.

305
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,270
Yes, thank you for that.

306
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,552
Ron and then Eunice, and then we're going to vote.

307
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:39,578
So my comment was that Frances is certainly the expert in this regard in terms of what the law says in terms of accessibility to the documents.

308
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:49,264
And I think she explained it very well that if you request it, you have to wait the legitimate amount of time for it to be translated or produced in a media that's easy.

309
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:52,086
I'm addressing Matthew's comment there.

310
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,127
So I think that

311
00:25:54,653 --> 00:26:02,584
It's not likely that we would translate every document and put it on the website, but there is a process in place by law that have to provide.

312
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,605
Is that correct, Francis?

313
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:11,111
Yes, there certainly is a process in place, and there are different steps to that process.

314
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:17,695
So, for example, things that get, let's say, something is passed, right?

315
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:19,757
City clerk's office is right down the hall.

316
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:22,799
Boom, that's done, that's stamped, that's filed away.

317
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,580
But may take longer to get uploaded, right?

318
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,522
Because getting uploaded is out of my hands.

319
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:32,505
It now requires two other people to become involved.

320
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:34,926
Does that help?

321
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:49,176
And then in regards to ordinances, I mean, sometimes, unfortunately, people mistake being invited to help craft ordinances as, okay, they're done, and now that ordinance is now in effect.

322
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:59,884
And don't realize that just because you're part of helping to draft an ordinance, it does not mean that when you're done drafting it, that that ordinance is in effect.

323
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:01,485
And I say that

324
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,542
With regards to a draft ordinance that was created that.

325
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:17,347
I wasn't aware of and most members think that that is how we're moving forward and it involves other parties for it to become legitimate.

326
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:23,481
I would just, you know, again, I would just caution you by law.

327
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:27,647
We are required to provide access to this information.

328
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:38,921
I would just be careful of saying how and what time you're going to provide that access because no 1 person controls the incoming request all the way to the end.

329
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:41,635
Okay, thank you.

330
00:27:41,835 --> 00:28:04,301
So the motion is, it's about rules and regulations, as Gene pointed out, and it's basically we're just asking the Collins Center when they draft this to make sure that they include language to ensure that the information is shared through, with the public through all available means, not, you know, and they will, I'm sure, I trust that they will phrase it appropriately.

331
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:08,482
So, can we vote?

332
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:16,160
I just want to clarify that what Gina said is correct.

333
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,141
I think we've convoluted a few different topics in this discussion.

334
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:25,443
This is only about city agency rules and regulations at the moment.

335
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:31,065
I think having the accessibility is certainly important.

336
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:34,926
I hear what Francis is saying that you can't just walk into the office,

337
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:43,295
And, you know, the clerk's office and expect to be handed something, you know, especially if you're, you know.

338
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:50,644
Looking for it in, you know, another language or another.

339
00:28:54,404 --> 00:29:07,088
But then to address what our member of the public, Matthew, has said, I think what he's referring to, or I know what he's referring to, I see, is meeting minutes and so forth.

340
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:14,090
And I think that needs to be addressed too, but I think that falls over where we go to the multi-member body parts.

341
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:28,433
I think that we can address that when we get to that section so that people can get the minutes and agendas and things that they're interested in as well.

342
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:36,274
But like Jean said, what we're dealing with here and now in this board is just the rules and regulations of the city agency.

343
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,455
Okay.

344
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:43,936
We have the motion on the table and I will go around Anthony.

345
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:45,811
Yes.

346
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:48,553
Paulette.

347
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:49,634
Yes.

348
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:51,075
Aubrey.

349
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:52,796
Yes.

350
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:54,077
Maury.

351
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:54,878
Yes.

352
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,279
Jean.

353
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,460
Yes.

354
00:29:58,761 --> 00:29:59,141
Phyllis.

355
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:00,042
Yes.

356
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,202
Eunice.

357
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:01,803
Yes.

358
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:02,944
Danielle.

359
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:03,985
Yes.

360
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:05,085
Ron.

361
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:05,966
Yes.

362
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:07,447
Okay.

363
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:08,508
And I'm also yes.

364
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:21,423
Okay, awesome so we want to address part 2 of that where I think it was the 5 day window units right that.

365
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,866
Can you just read can you read that out again?

366
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:26,609
Yeah.

367
00:30:32,402 --> 00:30:48,270
Unless an emergency exists as determined by the mayor, no rule or regulation adopted by a city agency shall become effective less than five days following the date it is also so filed.

368
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:55,254
So, did I?

369
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:59,096
So you're saying you, I mean, do you want to make a motion for that?

370
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,157
I mean, it was,

371
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,496
Yeah, I mean, it's in the sample as well.

372
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:14,218
I'm making a motion to keep that language.

373
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,099
Anybody want a second?

374
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:20,159
Second.

375
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,200
Okay.

376
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:22,820
Ron.

377
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:29,682
It should say business days though.

378
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,932
I was going to say that, yeah.

379
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:40,555
I think that that's part of the definitions that the Collins Center will work through when they create our draft.

380
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,456
They'll work on the A's problem.

381
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:44,617
Okay.

382
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:45,477
Danielle?

383
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:47,898
Yes.

384
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,099
Jean?

385
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,160
Yes.

386
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,821
Eunice?

387
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:53,481
Yes.

388
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:55,802
Aubrey?

389
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:56,062
Yes.

390
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:03,196
Maury, did I get you?

391
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:05,377
Sorry, I've lost track of my windows.

392
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:06,778
I'm a yes vote.

393
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,379
Okay.

394
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,741
Paulette, did I get you?

395
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:11,381
Yes.

396
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:14,303
You didn't get me and I'm a yes, Phyllis.

397
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:16,444
Okay.

398
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,486
Anthony, I don't think I got Anthony.

399
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:24,150
I don't understand the ramifications of the five days, so I'll just abstain.

400
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,010
Okay.

401
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:28,593
I feel like I missed one person.

402
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:28,953
Did I?

403
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:31,272
I got everybody?

404
00:32:31,712 --> 00:32:35,574
Okay, Maury voted.

405
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:38,555
Okay, and I'll vote yes.

406
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:40,155
Okay, awesome.

407
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:41,576
What's next?

408
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:45,117
Oh, the ordinances, periodic review of ordinances.

409
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:54,981
So as you can see, the Collins Center said that ordinance reviews are, they're getting more common.

410
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,222
It's becoming a standard feature of a modern charter.

411
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,696
They're usually done every five years.

412
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:06,201
And they gave us three examples.

413
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:08,522
And the language is a little different in each one.

414
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:10,264
So did people have a chance to look at them?

415
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:11,765
I did.

416
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,086
Let's see.

417
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:13,826
Where are they?

418
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:22,393
Let's see if I don't have them for the screen.

419
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:26,296
I think that they all said five years, right?

420
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:34,178
But, you know, the first one, the East Hampton one said the city council may provide.

421
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,080
So that seemed like it sort of left it open.

422
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:45,430
And they didn't all require the formation of a committee, right, East Hampton.

423
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:55,647
had the review just conducted under the supervision of city attorney, or if the city council so directs by special counsel appointed for that purpose.

424
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:01,529
But the other two, I think, had the formation of a special committee.

425
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,150
Yeah, Winthrop and Northampton.

426
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:13,533
Does anybody have any thoughts about the different versions or how you... Do you want me to try to share my screen, Melva?

427
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,554
If you have them up, that'd be great.

428
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,788
Uh, can I hop in here for a 2nd?

429
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:20,169
Yeah, I like the 5 years.

430
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:22,151
I kind of like a committee.

431
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:36,503
Maybe it doesn't have to be a 1215 or 22 person committee might be a committee made up of representative of the mayor's office or the city in a city council representative and even a school committee representative and maybe.

432
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:41,659
three people from the public that are interested.

433
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:51,881
I'd like to see a committee made up in general of people that are within City Hall and outside of City Hall to review this the proper way.

434
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:52,421
Okay.

435
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:53,482
Thanks.

436
00:34:53,562 --> 00:35:02,084
Jean, I think we had actually language from the call-in center that had three different versions of it.

437
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:03,024
Ron?

438
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:07,698
Did you want to find out the language if you allow me to share my screen?

439
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:08,538
Okay.

440
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:09,598
I will.

441
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,679
I was just going to ask.

442
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:12,359
Okay.

443
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:23,182
I'll just say that I thought that the Northampton was most precise, and the only issue I have is that we're a city without a city solicitor, so we may have to want to change that length.

444
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:25,862
Okay.

445
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:31,064
Any, let's see.

446
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:31,964
Yeah, here we go.

447
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,191
I agree with you, Ron.

448
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,953
That was my pick, too, of the three.

449
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:38,574
I liked the Northampton.

450
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:41,196
Did anybody have any thoughts about the others?

451
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:43,318
Here's the Northampton language.

452
00:35:47,688 --> 00:36:02,578
So not later than July 1st at five-year intervals, the mayor and city council shall provide for a review to be made of some or all of the ordinances of the city to prepare a proposed revision or break codification of them.

453
00:36:03,298 --> 00:36:06,240
It shall be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance.

454
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:16,987
So this puts the particulars of the formation in the hands of the city government to establish by ordinance.

455
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:24,347
but it does stipulate that they're all voters and it says a couple of other details.

456
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:25,128
Dean.

457
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:35,317
This process, they make recommendations which can or cannot be acted on by city council.

458
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:36,558
Yes.

459
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:38,560
That's what I understand.

460
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:40,438
I just wanted to.

461
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:53,087
And it also, you know, it gives flexibility because it says some or all of the ordinances because, you know, obviously a complete review of all the ordinances every five years would be.

462
00:36:53,107 --> 00:37:00,193
And some of them are specialized and people may need to

463
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:05,551
have some training or something to understand how they haven't, what kind of impact they would have.

464
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:06,371
Right.

465
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:14,836
So this, and, and this particular language leaves it sort of up to the city government, how to structure the committee.

466
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,877
Um, Maury.

467
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,119
That's kind of like my point.

468
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:28,724
I was trying to take it completely out of the hands of city government to say, okay, these are the parameters you have to work on to, to,

469
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:44,849
for the revision of the charter or how we want to do it and so forth within the five years, so that it's not in the hands of one individual or one segment of the government is in control of it.

470
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,692
You've got parameters you have to work under.

471
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:51,486
So you're okay with this language then?

472
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,848
No, I'd like to see some sort of a structure, like I said.

473
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:05,914
Okay, one person from the mayor's office, one person from the council, one person from the city, from school committee, and a couple, two or three residents.

474
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:08,375
So it's well-rounded.

475
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,145
Like we did for the charter.

476
00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:12,766
Exactly.

477
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:13,406
Okay.

478
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:14,366
Um, Eunice.

479
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,128
You know, I, I like this to a point.

480
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:24,531
It says, you know, the review should be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance.

481
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,793
The committee is going to be established by ordinance.

482
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,334
Who is it that creates the ordinances?

483
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:32,754
The city council.

484
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:42,099
The city council then, if we went this direction, would then get to decide how the committee is structured.

485
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,140
I agree with Maury.

486
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,623
I like this in general, but I agree with Maury that I think that I would like to see us,

487
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:58,901
provide some structure, as he so eloquently said, of who should be on that committee.

488
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:11,645
So that there is some decent representation from an appointee by the mayor, appointees by the council and the school committee.

489
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,623
residents as well for input.

490
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:34,331
And then the only other piece that I would add, let's see, the review of the copy where it says at the end, copies of any recommendations shall be made to the public at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of reproduction.

491
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:37,392
Again, wanting to bring that into the 21st century,

492
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:51,154
My language that I would like to add to that would be that the mayor shall establish a page on the city website for the ordinance review committee.

493
00:39:52,015 --> 00:40:03,885
Any recommendations shall be made available on the designated page on the city website, as well as made available in hard copy form at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of the reproduction.

494
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:25,514
A little bit similar to what we were just talking about a few minutes ago with whatever provisions that we have to make in terms of things being available in any particular means so that a resident can easily access it.

495
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:26,634
Okay.

496
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:28,635
Aubrey?

497
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:48,130
Yeah, I like unison's recommendation to change some of this language, but I would make it just a tiny bit broader and just say, um, these recommendations shall be made freely and easily available to the public and understand it.

498
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:50,892
Okay.

499
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:55,576
I'd like to jam in if I could.

500
00:40:56,777 --> 00:41:03,382
You know, we're talking about ordinances and, you know, the city council is, you know, that's what they're elected.

501
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:08,197
to do the legislative part of the city government.

502
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:17,440
And I really, I kind of like the phrasing that it will be established by the city council.

503
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,641
This is really, you know, their territory.

504
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:33,605
And I think it's wise to leave it up to the legislative branch to, you know, to come up with something by ordinance.

505
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:40,794
uh, that would work for them and for the city because, you know, this is really, you know, their job.

506
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:42,775
This is what they're elected to do.

507
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:49,018
I don't know if, uh, you know, the school committee, uh, really has a lot of, uh,

508
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,624
input into ordinances, nor should the mayor.

509
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:56,425
I think that's why we have it, you know, separated.

510
00:41:56,565 --> 00:42:00,847
And just about the, we don't have a solicitor.

511
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:01,527
We do.

512
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:09,451
We hire a law firm to act as our solicitor, like many of the communities in Massachusetts.

513
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:17,434
So when they say legal counsel, you know, whatever group of practice we employ,

514
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:30,656
access our solicitor you know it may not be an individual person it has people with all different types of expertise and and uh you know they i'm sure they can uh

515
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:43,704
Oversee something like this what I'm concerned about is is the cost of of this, you know, like, is this something that is, you know, can this be costly to the community?

516
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:45,024
Like, how many legal hour?

517
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:48,586
How many how much attorney time with something like this?

518
00:42:50,055 --> 00:43:13,227
involved you know it's it's in the modern charters that we know like is this you know uh you know a couple hours of legal work or is it you know weeks and weeks of uh you know hundreds of dollar an hour attorney costs that's just my my feedback okay thank you um ron

519
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:15,414
A couple of things.

520
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:20,540
First off, I don't really care what the cost is to do this.

521
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,922
It's something that needs to be done.

522
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:28,510
And I think what we're forgetting is that the charter review is a process that goes all the way up to the state house.

523
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,895
This process ends at the desk of the city council.

524
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:35,857
They're the only ones who can change an ordinance.

525
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:49,208
The way I see this, it's a review of what either are laws that have been on the books forever and have no significance anymore, or laws that need to be updated, or laws that need to be eliminated or tweaked.

526
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:52,812
And you can't do that without a lawyer.

527
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:56,555
And the only point I made about the city solicitor is,

528
00:43:57,758 --> 00:44:05,886
to change the verbiage to say, you know, it needs to be supervised by the city solicitor or their designee.

529
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:12,954
Whoever that agent is, whoever we hire as our city solicitor, it just updates that.

530
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,096
So it doesn't have to be the city solicitor.

531
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:19,740
Hopefully that the cost of something like this process will force the city to

532
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:23,663
to get a city solicitor, which would be on the payroll doing this.

533
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:26,405
But you can't do this without a city solicitor.

534
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,166
You can't do it without that.

535
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:36,911
But it's important to note that the process is just like us, but the buck stops right at the desk of the city council.

536
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:38,592
They're the only ones who can touch an ordinance.

537
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:40,713
Thank you.

538
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:42,394
Maury, did you want to speak?

539
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:49,533
Yeah, well, Ron kind of stole my thunder because everything he just said was where I was going.

540
00:44:49,553 --> 00:45:01,982
I hear what Anthony is saying, but what we're asking for as a review every five years, it still has to go to the

541
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:08,167
to the city council for approval and whatever the means are after that.

542
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:10,870
And obviously, legal is a big part of it.

543
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,813
And as Ron exactly said, it really doesn't matter how much it costs.

544
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,497
You know, things have to be done a certain way.

545
00:45:19,118 --> 00:45:20,859
And certain things, you know,

546
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,541
City has other ways of making up or trying to find money.

547
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:32,705
So certainly this is a very important thing on how the government is to run and what changes, what tweaks have to be made.

548
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:36,726
Because as we all know, a lot of things change in five years.

549
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:39,528
So that's kind of where I'm going with this.

550
00:45:40,848 --> 00:45:41,168
Thank you.

551
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:41,368
OK.

552
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:42,249
Thank you.

553
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,589
Jean?

554
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,491
I like the Northampton.

555
00:45:48,019 --> 00:46:01,813
Language because it does say some or all of the ordinances to do all of the ordinances every five years would be A serious undertaking, especially if they've already You know, maybe just redone the zoning laws.

556
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,535
They wouldn't need to to redo that piece.

557
00:46:04,656 --> 00:46:10,301
So I like giving that flexibility to city council exactly, okay, so

558
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:19,237
Where we are is we've had several members like Northampton, but there's some question about the structure of the committee.

559
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:22,358
Did I see, Ron, your hand up again?

560
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:25,138
No.

561
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:26,459
Maury's, no?

562
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:26,839
Okay.

563
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:39,263
So, I mean, does somebody want to move that we accept this language pretty much as is, or do we want to talk about changing the

564
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:47,565
committee and putting more sort of specific guidelines on it in this section.

565
00:46:48,385 --> 00:47:03,188
Can we just, is it possible to change the verbiage on the city solicitor and just add or I don't know, I don't know what the exact words are, but just to me, it's just, well, I think what we can do is make a note.

566
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:05,249
Yeah, go ahead.

567
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:18,544
make a note to the call-in center, you know, just keep in mind when you're drafting this charter that we don't currently have a city solicitor.

568
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:20,565
So, see, yeah, legal counsel.

569
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:23,047
It could just say legal counsel.

570
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:35,794
The reason why that's important, too, is because there's talk about the city council getting their own solicitor, and it would have to be the city solicitor, not the city council solicitor, I think, that supervises this.

571
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:46,775
Well, I mean, they had a charter amendment that they tried to pass, but we didn't put that in our draft charter.

572
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:49,818
We just put that they could hire staff, but we didn't.

573
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:50,659
No, I understand.

574
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:58,366
I'm just saying when we're no longer around, I just think it's important that it's the city solicitor, not the city council solicitor.

575
00:47:58,506 --> 00:47:58,987
Danielle.

576
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:05,971
Yeah, I agree that the language about, you know, not reviewing all ordinances every 5 years is important.

577
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,232
I wonder about like.

578
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:14,681
So I guess my worry is like, are there ordinances that aren't going to be reviewed for like several cycles?

579
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:25,864
And if there's like, we want to say that ordinances like, sorry, I don't know how exactly to word this, but I guess I'm thinking about if there's an ordinance that isn't reviewed for 25 years, like, is that a problem?

580
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:29,645
Because like, it doesn't make it to that review for several cycles.

581
00:48:30,405 --> 00:48:37,287
Should there be like any language around how often like ordinance, like single ordinances should be reviewed?

582
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,581
Does that make sense what I'm saying?

583
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,181
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

584
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:57,391
I mean, currently the way the North Hamilton language is written, it seems to me that it gives the mayor and the city council the leeway to decide which ordinances that they want to review, right?

585
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:12,527
But you're saying can we say that, can we add that, let's say, providing that every ordinance is reviewed at least every X number of years.

586
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:15,969
That's the point that I'm trying to make.

587
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:17,890
Is that important to include something like that?

588
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,090
Yeah.

589
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,052
That's what I was thinking too.

590
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:27,235
Any ordinance that hasn't been reviewed in at least 10 years,

591
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:32,713
Um, should should undergo.

592
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:36,675
A review, I mean, I, I think.

593
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:41,597
You know, like Maury said, he's got a good point there that, you know, a lot can change in 5 years.

594
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:44,238
Certainly, but I think.

595
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:47,820
Any any ordinance that hasn't seen a review.

596
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,682
In the last decade, um, certainly needs a look.

597
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:54,583
To see if it's.

598
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:58,297
As Ron said, still relevant.

599
00:49:58,317 --> 00:50:11,906
The example that I gave last week because our ordinances haven't been reviewed in heaven knows how long, and that's what the city council evidently is attempting to do during this two-year term.

600
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:16,249
You can't park your horse and buggy in front of the post office.

601
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:18,490
It's something that needs a review.

602
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:28,062
So the thing is, if you're saying every 10 years, that's two review cycles.

603
00:50:28,843 --> 00:50:35,529
So you're really saying half the ordinances should be reviewed at one point and the other half.

604
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,151
That's a good point.

605
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:45,137
I mean, do you want to say three-year cycles, though 15 years sounds like a long time?

606
00:50:45,478 --> 00:50:48,841
But two-year cycles really means half and half.

607
00:50:49,741 --> 00:51:01,064
So, right, so you're saying if we decided to add a line saying that no ordinance should go longer than 10 years without being reviewed, and that, could that be burdensome?

608
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:03,845
That's a big review every five years, right?

609
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:05,305
Yeah.

610
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,066
I think it could be different, though.

611
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:15,908
Like, because if an ordinance is created in the middle of that five years of being reviewed, like, that's going to, that could be three cycles of.

612
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:17,449
Yeah, that's true.

613
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:19,069
Aubrey?

614
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:27,661
I, I don't think I would prefer not to have specific language, but I understand the sentiment.

615
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:31,984
Mostly it's because I think that, um, what is a review?

616
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:40,289
Because I can put eyes on every ordinance and say, I reviewed all of them, but here are three that I'm suggesting to change.

617
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:41,550
Yeah.

618
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:45,793
And then I can say that I reviewed all of them, but I really haven't.

619
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:48,595
So I think that the question of what is a review.

620
00:51:50,117 --> 00:51:54,844
is important here, and I would not include specific language about how many need to be reviewed.

621
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,446
Okay, thank you.

622
00:51:57,828 --> 00:51:58,148
Jean?

623
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,634
Yeah, I'm with Aubrey.

624
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:04,297
I mean, we have 94 chapters.

625
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:10,246
In our ordinances, I mean, it's just a lot of pages.

626
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:23,983
And I think if we want to put a year date on it, then I would say more like 25 years every 25 years, there should be a comprehensive review because 10 years really isn't.

627
00:52:25,197 --> 00:52:29,519
that long for things to be enacted and implemented.

628
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,722
That would just be my, it's a lot, there's a lot of ordinances.

629
00:52:35,922 --> 00:52:42,645
So it's just, I guess maybe think about what we're trying to accomplish with all this work.

630
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:54,030
And I think we're trying to get rid of things that don't make sense anymore or that need to be updated, but maybe 25 years is better.

631
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,690
I don't know.

632
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,382
That's my concern.

633
00:52:56,402 --> 00:52:56,902
Okay.

634
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:00,045
Ron?

635
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:16,019
Yeah, I think we've been, since we started this process, the Cullin Center has always cautioned us to be too detailed, not to be too detailed with these changes and let the people decide how that works.

636
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,901
So I agree with Aubrey that

637
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,543
We should not have those kind of details.

638
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:26,487
Secondly, to everybody else's point, you know, who's ever talked about it?

639
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:28,348
Who's ever talked about an ordinance review?

640
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:34,612
I think that if we implement this process, I mean, you can change an ordinance tomorrow if you want, if it's bad.

641
00:53:34,672 --> 00:53:36,654
We don't need a review team to do that.

642
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:49,576
I think what we create here is a change in the fabric of how we look at ordinances so that people will be able to, over the five years before the next review, there'll be a list of ordinances requested that we want to look at.

643
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:52,797
And people will start looking at ordinances in a different way.

644
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:58,178
So I think the more, for lack of a better word, vague is the best way to go.

645
00:53:58,218 --> 00:54:01,679
And I think that's what the Collins Center has said to us since we started this.

646
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:04,496
Okay, thank you.

647
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,059
Maury, did you have another comment?

648
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:08,562
Yeah, I just wanted to hop in a little bit.

649
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:12,007
I'm going to say this and kind of pick up.

650
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:23,172
like almost a compromise point from what everyone's saying, what Gene is and Aubrey, that within 15 years that maybe all ordinances should be looked at.

651
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:25,754
They could be just rubber stamped and moved on.

652
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:31,078
And I understand, Gene, what you're saying, how many pages and ordinances there are there.

653
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:42,688
But I think the main thing on a review of the ordinance is, again, I'm going to go back to, is the structure of who's looking at this.

654
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:56,889
And, you know, as long as it isn't just all, you know, the left hand controlling it, that there's a left hand, a right hand in the middle, all involved in this to look at it sensibly and not biased,

655
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:00,374
you can blow right through all this stuff.

656
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:07,964
We're doing all the hard work now, and things are going to change from year to year to look at it.

657
00:55:08,364 --> 00:55:16,534
But I'd say all audiences within the 15-year period should be just looked at, not every year and so forth.

658
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:17,956
But that's my point.

659
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:20,439
Okay, Eunice.

660
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:28,148
Yeah, I feel as strongly as Maury does that we need to have some structure of who would be on this committee.

661
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:31,251
I think having anything in here.

662
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:35,296
I think reviewing ordinances to me is just.

663
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:48,109
general, you know, wise house governmental housekeeping, you know, much like you, you know, clean your furnace every year or get, you got us cleaned.

664
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:51,011
It's, it's good housekeeping.

665
00:55:51,871 --> 00:56:04,238
And so I think, you know, I could go either way on the vagueness or the not vagueness of it, you know, an ordinance that, you know, if this went into effect and, you know, uh,

666
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:28,000
the committee starts looking at ordinances two years from now, they may not need to give too much attention to an ordinance that was established a year or so ago, but an ordinance that was 15 years ago will require a good look.

667
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:30,663
And I think leaving it up to

668
00:56:32,277 --> 00:56:50,921
you know, the group, the committee to determine which ordinances need that look, um, might be wise, but I'm right on board with Maury that the, the structure of the committee has to be legislated within this.

669
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,302
Okay.

670
00:56:52,402 --> 00:56:52,762
Thanks.

671
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:54,282
Danielle.

672
00:56:55,939 --> 00:57:02,054
Yeah, just to like kind of add or restate, I think I'm, I think I agree with her with more units are saying about like,

673
00:57:03,441 --> 00:57:11,485
It just being that no ordinance should be not reviewed for like, you know, after 25 years or shouldn't go more than like 20 or 25 years without being reviewed.

674
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:22,909
I think because I do wonder like how if there are ordinances that maybe like benefit different bodies differently, if they would sort of be like less likely to be reviewed.

675
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,251
And that and also like, you know, that idea of having an unbiased

676
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:29,933
group of people reviewing it.

677
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:31,274
I think that that's really important.

678
00:57:31,334 --> 00:57:32,475
But so, yeah, I don't know.

679
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:43,625
I think I I still do think the idea of making like maybe just one line about no ordinance should go more than X amount of times without being X amount of years without being reviewed would be useful.

680
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:46,348
But I also can see the disagreement, too.

681
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:49,551
Okay, so we've talked a lot.

682
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:53,632
First, I just want to say timekeeping-wise, we have one more hour left.

683
00:57:54,112 --> 00:57:58,553
If we can get through everything on the agenda, we won't have to meet next week, and I'm still hopeful.

684
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,694
I just want to have that in everybody's mind.

685
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:05,035
I feel like there's three parts to this.

686
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:13,576
There's the timing of the review, which I haven't heard a lot of disagreement about every five years, as long as we use the language, some or all.

687
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:16,177
The other piece is the

688
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:25,538
composition of the committee, whether it should be just left to ordinance or whether we should specify.

689
00:58:25,558 --> 00:58:37,283
And the other piece is, should there be a line added that says every ordinance should be reviewed within at least every X number of years?

690
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:39,284
So let's take them one by one.

691
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:41,986
So for the five-year review,

692
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:50,861
Do we want to vote on that and say, like, I'll just make a motion that we have an ordinance review every five years?

693
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:54,542
I'll make a motion that we have an ordinance review every five years.

694
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:55,703
OK.

695
00:58:56,143 --> 00:58:56,763
Second.

696
00:58:58,063 --> 00:58:58,604
OK.

697
00:58:58,944 --> 00:59:02,365
So all right.

698
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:03,246
Eunice?

699
00:59:04,386 --> 00:59:04,646
Yes.

700
00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:06,007
Maury?

701
00:59:06,447 --> 00:59:06,707
Yes.

702
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:10,108
Ron?

703
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:12,229
Yes.

704
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:13,910
Anthony?

705
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:15,283
Yes.

706
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:16,863
Danielle?

707
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:17,904
Yes.

708
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:18,704
Jean?

709
00:59:19,664 --> 00:59:19,964
Yes.

710
00:59:20,304 --> 00:59:20,764
Paulette?

711
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:21,485
Yes.

712
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:22,425
Aubrey?

713
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:23,285
Yes.

714
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:25,466
Is Phyllis out there?

715
00:59:26,106 --> 00:59:27,466
Yes, I second the motion.

716
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:28,286
Yes, I am.

717
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:28,886
Yes.

718
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:29,387
Okay.

719
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:30,547
I can't see everybody.

720
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:32,547
I can't see the boxes now because of the screen share.

721
00:59:32,587 --> 00:59:34,868
So Phyllis, did you vote yes?

722
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:38,478
Okay, and I'll vote yes.

723
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:40,179
So awesome.

724
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:41,660
We've got that piece done.

725
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:44,543
What about the composition of the committee?

726
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:47,905
I mean, I guess- I'll make a motion.

727
00:59:48,506 --> 00:59:49,527
Okay.

728
00:59:50,167 --> 01:00:04,539
That the composition of this review committee would consist of a member from the mayor's office, member of the city council, member of the school committee,

729
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:10,619
in four members of the community at large.

730
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:19,106
I'd like to say something before we end that.

731
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,928
I just want to get it down right.

732
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:25,572
When you say a city councilor or appointed by?

733
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:28,315
No, I'd rather see a city councilor myself.

734
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:30,800
Okay, and same with school committee?

735
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,860
Committee, that's correct.

736
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:37,265
And someone from the mayor's office, appointed from the mayor's office, that's in the mayor's office.

737
01:00:38,746 --> 01:00:44,831
And do we want to be consistent with the, instead of like members at large, like residents or voters?

738
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:46,272
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

739
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:47,573
Yeah, you're right, Danielle.

740
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:48,354
Yeah, sure.

741
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:50,155
And for voters, okay.

742
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:52,317
Anthony, you had a comment?

743
01:00:53,360 --> 01:01:06,083
Yes, the only comment I really want to make is that, you know, we talked a lot, you know, over this past year about balance of power and ordinances are clearly, you know, within the realm of city council.

744
01:01:06,383 --> 01:01:09,284
That's their main, their main job in the city.

745
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:22,927
And I think if we are going to do a review of ordinances, it really should be left up to the city council to draft an ordinance of who's going to be on the committee, when it's going to meet, how it's going to function.

746
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:29,850
because it's in their realm of authority.

747
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,230
They're about ordinances.

748
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:33,971
The mayor is the executive.

749
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:36,912
Let's keep it separate the way it's supposed to be.

750
01:01:36,932 --> 01:01:45,176
And the city council, it'll be their responsibility to get the people on this committee to do this work.

751
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:47,717
And it'll change.

752
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,097
It's not

753
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:51,965
this city council that's sitting right now.

754
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:58,811
We don't even know who'll be on the city council, who'll be available, you know, how much community participation there'll be.

755
01:01:59,512 --> 01:02:08,580
Let the people who are elected to deal with ordinances, you know, make sure that there's a review process.

756
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,183
We enshrined it in the charter, they have to do it.

757
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:14,425
And they have to figure it out.

758
01:02:15,337 --> 01:02:19,498
Anthony, we're not taking that away from the city council by this.

759
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,999
City council is going to have the last say in this.

760
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:25,980
No, we've been trying to get this.

761
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,822
All of this is a review of the work, basically, of what we're doing five years from now.

762
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:34,182
No, no.

763
01:02:34,202 --> 01:02:35,303
So wait a minute, guys.

764
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:39,408
It's no, it's not the charter, it's the ordinances.

765
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:46,316
I actually, I agree with Anthony on this because I do feel like it's in the wheelhouse of the city council, but we're gonna vote.

766
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,619
But first Paulette and then Ron.

767
01:02:49,882 --> 01:03:02,550
I was just going to say I have sort of mixed feelings about the school committee inclusion only because the school committee, you know, people have a lot of their own things, meetings to go to and whatever.

768
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,672
So it's a fair uplift.

769
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:16,780
On the other hand, if we are inclusive and want to say, hey, for the good of the city, we want to have a variety of people looking at these ordinances, it makes sense.

770
01:03:18,714 --> 01:03:21,377
But I am, you know, I'm a little torn on this one.

771
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:23,519
But whatever.

772
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,061
Okay, Ron.

773
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:27,624
Yeah, I don't think any

774
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,161
government officials should be on this committee.

775
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:37,023
I don't think the city council should have a member on this board that eventually is going to present to that city councilor to decide.

776
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:45,865
So I'm about, you know, citizen-led, supervised by the city council, the city solicitor.

777
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:51,287
I mean, I can't see if you put, same reason why there's no city councilors on this board.

778
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:56,952
I mean, it just doesn't make sense to me that they would be deciding what goes in front of their board.

779
01:03:56,972 --> 01:03:58,173
It seems like a conflict to me.

780
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:02,838
So I would move that no government official is on that committee.

781
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:03,519
Okay.

782
01:04:03,819 --> 01:04:04,259
Wait a minute.

783
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,763
So that means Maury would have to amend his motion, I think.

784
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:08,824
Yeah.

785
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:11,346
Well, I mean, I'm just stating what I, you know.

786
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:11,627
Yeah.

787
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:12,868
Okay.

788
01:04:13,148 --> 01:04:14,530
Maury, did you want to speak?

789
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:17,455
I'm going to leave my motion the way it is.

790
01:04:19,217 --> 01:04:21,159
I understand what everybody else is saying.

791
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:32,512
The reason I'm including the school committee and a member of the city council on this review committee is

792
01:04:34,432 --> 01:04:43,100
These are the people, hopefully, that are in the know on the day-to-day operations, week-to-week operations of the inner workings of the city.

793
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,984
They have the best knowledge of what's going on.

794
01:04:50,580 --> 01:05:05,575
It's going to have to go back in front of a city solicitor or some legal committee, then it has to be voted on by the city council, because they are, as Anthony is saying, they are the legislature party of the city.

795
01:05:06,055 --> 01:05:10,319
But I think a member that deals with it a lot more

796
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:20,955
on a daily basis than John Q Public is good input, as long as the input is being real and authentic.

797
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:23,597
OK, thanks.

798
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:25,778
Aubrey?

799
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:38,786
I'll be on broken record here that I'm optimistic about the future and the people who will be in place then to make these decisions.

800
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,688
And I do agree with Morrie that these feel

801
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:51,135
Highly technical and that the people appointed should have some specific knowledge about ordinances and some.

802
01:05:52,356 --> 01:05:57,200
Just the things involved in this decision, I think I would like to move to people with.

803
01:05:58,061 --> 01:06:00,663
The knowledge, the deep knowledge to be able to make those decisions.

804
01:06:02,134 --> 01:06:02,994
Yeah.

805
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:04,895
I think that's a really good point.

806
01:06:05,115 --> 01:06:12,877
I think even the city council sometimes especially needs legal guidance when they're writing ordinances.

807
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:21,759
It's their job to legislate, but they need guidance too.

808
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,040
Did the motion get seconded?

809
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:28,721
What is the motion?

810
01:06:30,391 --> 01:06:36,113
Well, Jean, can I just have Jean's comment and then I'll reread the motion as I have it recorded.

811
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:43,876
That was my question is, is it to replace language in the Northampton version?

812
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:52,799
Yeah, it would be instead of having the review committee established by ordinance, it would be

813
01:06:55,227 --> 01:07:05,002
The motion is that the review committee is made up of one member appointed from the mayor's office, one city councilor, one school committee member, and four voters.

814
01:07:06,595 --> 01:07:07,375
So that's the motion.

815
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:09,957
Who's deciding who those people like?

816
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:10,837
Is it is the mayor?

817
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:11,938
Is it like other?

818
01:07:12,218 --> 01:07:13,858
That's a good point, Maury.

819
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:16,360
It has to say who's appointing the voters.

820
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:28,905
I would say it would have to be like our body that the mayor would have to be able to have the final say on the on the because we're giving the mayor the strength on everything else we're doing as far as committees, basically.

821
01:07:30,506 --> 01:07:42,950
Unless somebody else has a better suggestion of who should be the person that decides on who the at large, you know, junkie public should be on this committee.

822
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:45,011
I mean, I'm open to everything.

823
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:47,172
I just, you know, I just like to see it.

824
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:49,872
spread out through the entire time.

825
01:07:49,892 --> 01:07:50,173
Okay.

826
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:52,753
Well, let's vote on it and see where it's at.

827
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:56,894
And then if we have to finesse who appoints the four voters, we will.

828
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:58,315
Okay.

829
01:07:58,635 --> 01:08:00,615
So Ron.

830
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:03,296
No.

831
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:04,916
Eunice.

832
01:08:07,457 --> 01:08:07,757
Yes.

833
01:08:08,777 --> 01:08:09,177
Maury.

834
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:10,077
Yes.

835
01:08:10,678 --> 01:08:11,158
Danielle.

836
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:12,458
Yes.

837
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:14,298
Gene.

838
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:15,399
No.

839
01:08:16,499 --> 01:08:16,779
Aubrey.

840
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:17,947
No.

841
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:18,787
Phyllis?

842
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:19,948
No.

843
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:22,369
Paulette?

844
01:08:23,469 --> 01:08:23,809
Yes.

845
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:30,191
And who didn't I get?

846
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:31,091
Anthony.

847
01:08:31,351 --> 01:08:31,731
Anthony.

848
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:32,452
Anthony.

849
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:33,752
No.

850
01:08:33,932 --> 01:08:35,413
Don't they like you tonight?

851
01:08:36,053 --> 01:08:36,973
Anthony's no.

852
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:38,834
And I'm also no.

853
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,644
The motion does not carry.

854
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:53,813
So now we're back to still the question of how the committee would be, I mean, whether we want to say it's going to be established by ordinance or some other way.

855
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:05,041
I'd just like to say, let's just let the city council do their job.

856
01:09:06,782 --> 01:09:08,023
Let them find the people.

857
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:23,533
by ordinance, let them figure it out, you know, they're going to have to kind of work with, you know, work with the committee, you know, that brings up, you know, any specific issue in an ordinance, you know.

858
01:09:24,613 --> 01:09:34,221
We have ordinances that God knows must have been beyond the books for, you know, 50 years, and they're dormant, and they really, you know, do they,

859
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:37,606
need to be reviewed often?

860
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:38,207
I don't know.

861
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:39,948
Let the city council figure it out.

862
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:41,909
I think they're trying to do it right now.

863
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,790
That depends on what you want to say.

864
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:47,432
Do you want to make a motion that we keep the Northampton language?

865
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:50,594
Yes.

866
01:09:51,035 --> 01:09:52,015
It sounds reasonable.

867
01:09:52,335 --> 01:10:00,840
I think if we're going to have a review, I think they came up with a reasonable plan.

868
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,001
Okay.

869
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:01,201
Maury.

870
01:10:07,108 --> 01:10:14,938
No, just quickly, I mean, I think, you know, you need to review however we structure it.

871
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,665
My fear is having one body that's in, you know,

872
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:30,901
Usually one body that's elected has a controlling interest, whether it be Democrat, Republican, or whatever you want to call.

873
01:10:31,402 --> 01:10:36,706
And they're going to control the people that you're putting in a review.

874
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:41,670
That's why, how do you offset that?

875
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:43,975
Yeah, I hear you.

876
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:54,780
I guess my view is that I see this particular review as actually almost like a support for the city council because the city council is the legislative body.

877
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,621
They get elected by the people.

878
01:10:57,401 --> 01:10:59,222
The ordinances are their wheelhouse.

879
01:10:59,402 --> 01:11:05,384
And this is a sort of a way to support them in their work of managing the ordinances.

880
01:11:05,444 --> 01:11:07,465
That's just my interpretation of this.

881
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:26,119
Or how about this, just controlling their interests, and maybe not what the entire city is going, and the other side of the electorate doesn't even have a voice, because they're not the ones that are electing.

882
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:28,745
to the left or to the right.

883
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:41,569
And that's why I like independent and I like one group, not necessarily against another group, but as checks and balances.

884
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:43,150
I hear you.

885
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,370
That makes sense.

886
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:45,371
Aubrey.

887
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:52,633
I think there's going to have to be some level of trust involved in this because I could

888
01:11:53,475 --> 01:12:00,603
I could create a committee and say review all of these and then they come back to me with no recommendations for changes.

889
01:12:01,003 --> 01:12:03,686
Like a review does not mean that there are going to be changes.

890
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:11,215
And so I think that we have to trust whoever is going to be on this committee to make good decisions.

891
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:14,138
And we can't put that into a charter.

892
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:16,459
Yeah, good point.

893
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:16,859
Thank you.

894
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:30,366
So, um, we want to, I want to hear from Eunice and Jean and Ron, but I just also want to just point out that, uh, if we really would be awesome, if, um, uh, we, uh, could finish our work tonight.

895
01:12:30,866 --> 01:12:39,471
Um, Eunice, you know, I agree with what Maury is saying about checks and balances, um, and having, you know, citizens on there.

896
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,892
And I agree wholeheartedly.

897
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:44,634
The reality is though, that, um,

898
01:12:46,102 --> 01:13:11,215
whoever's doing the appointing here of these, you know, and this goes for the multi-member bodies and so forth as well, is that whatever, you know, piece of the electorate is the dominant power at any given time is likely to appoint

899
01:13:12,947 --> 01:13:22,874
residents or members of whatever body, um, you know, to their, to whatever board it is.

900
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:41,587
So, you know, the checks and balances, I wholeheartedly agree with, I just think that whoever is the dominant, you know, group that's in power, whether it be a slate or whoever, at any given time, they're going to be, you know, appointing,

901
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:57,471
you know, if we told them that they could have, you know, that there could be 10 residents on here, then whoever is, you know, in power is going to likely appoint 10 people that are, you know, like-minded to that dominant body.

902
01:13:58,592 --> 01:14:05,338
You know, that's gonna be the case in any... I think, I have to say this, I agree with Aubrey, that we have to have some level of trust.

903
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:10,755
I mean, there's gonna be- Just point of information, point of information, Melva.

904
01:14:10,955 --> 01:14:12,035
We voted that down.

905
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:14,196
Right now we have no motion on the floor.

906
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:20,258
So I'd like to motion that we accept the Northampton version of this rule and take a vote.

907
01:14:20,278 --> 01:14:22,699
And we've already had the discussion on that one.

908
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:25,260
So I'm just looking to keep it moving.

909
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,601
So I'm moving that we use the Northampton version.

910
01:14:30,102 --> 01:14:30,502
Okay.

911
01:14:31,002 --> 01:14:33,383
There was a third piece though we were talking about.

912
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:34,922
Which piece?

913
01:14:35,602 --> 01:14:39,984
About whether an ordinance should go more than a certain amount of time without being reviewed.

914
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:43,985
Okay, let's take that next, but to see, because that would be an addition.

915
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:54,649
So right now we're just going to vote on whether we want to accept the language about the, um, from the North Hampton charter about this committee.

916
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,230
I want a second Ron's motion.

917
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:57,970
Okay.

918
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:58,570
Anthony.

919
01:15:00,151 --> 01:15:01,071
I'll vote.

920
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:01,431
Yes.

921
01:15:01,551 --> 01:15:01,691
Yeah.

922
01:15:01,711 --> 01:15:01,872
Yeah.

923
01:15:01,992 --> 01:15:02,212
Yes.

924
01:15:02,452 --> 01:15:02,652
Ron.

925
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:04,568
Yes.

926
01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:07,470
Eunice.

927
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:08,871
Yes.

928
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:10,552
Maury.

929
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:11,632
No.

930
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:13,413
Phyllis.

931
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:14,194
Yes.

932
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:15,234
Aubrey.

933
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:18,857
You're muted, Aubrey.

934
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:19,197
Yes.

935
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:20,758
Danielle.

936
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:21,998
Yes.

937
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:24,020
Paulette.

938
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:24,620
Yes.

939
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:28,039
Uh, I'm missing one person.

940
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,220
Yes.

941
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:30,920
Okay.

942
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,240
And I will also vote.

943
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:32,500
Yes.

944
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,040
Okay.

945
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,620
Awesome.

946
01:15:34,381 --> 01:15:41,322
Um, so now, um, The third piece about adding language.

947
01:15:42,002 --> 01:15:49,943
So Danielle, do you want to make a motion about that, about adding language that every ordinance shall be, I would say like no ordinance shell.

948
01:15:50,743 --> 01:15:53,184
Go more than 25 years without being reviewed.

949
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:54,404
Okay.

950
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,791
Can I just ask a question, Danielle?

951
01:15:57,312 --> 01:16:03,157
When you say be reviewed, do you mean like there's a stamp of approval or do you think it's just like, well, we read it?

952
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:07,241
I mean, whatever it means in this whole section.

953
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:10,043
No, no, that's why it's confusing.

954
01:16:10,463 --> 01:16:11,444
I hear what you're trying to do.

955
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,105
I really do.

956
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:15,828
It's just I don't know how you... Okay, I reviewed this.

957
01:16:16,389 --> 01:16:16,769
Okay.

958
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:19,591
I mean, that's the same language that's used for the whole section.

959
01:16:19,652 --> 01:16:20,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:20,993
Now I hear you.

961
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:21,653
I support you.

962
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:27,072
I agree fully with Dan.

963
01:16:27,312 --> 01:16:28,653
I'd like to tighten it up a little bit.

964
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:30,394
I'd like to go to 15 years.

965
01:16:30,414 --> 01:16:31,915
I'd like to make an amendment to that.

966
01:16:32,516 --> 01:16:38,920
No audience should go beyond 15 years without at least being looked at, so forth, whatever the group thinks.

967
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:39,741
25 years, I'm in no growth.

968
01:16:41,745 --> 01:16:44,206
How do you feel about that, Danielle?

969
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,467
I'll be with you, Maury.

970
01:16:45,787 --> 01:16:48,429
I still live in the city, Anthony, you know?

971
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:49,849
Danielle?

972
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,110
How do you feel about 15 years?

973
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:53,191
OK, Paulette?

974
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,233
Well, I was going to say 20, but 15 is OK with me.

975
01:16:56,413 --> 01:16:58,894
I mean, can we split the difference and go 20?

976
01:16:59,654 --> 01:16:59,895
Sure.

977
01:17:00,775 --> 01:17:01,075
OK.

978
01:17:01,595 --> 01:17:06,038
So the motion on the floor is no ordinance shall go more than 20 years without being reviewed.

979
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:08,379
Did we get a second?

980
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:09,240
Second.

981
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,312
Okay, Maury.

982
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:13,173
Yes.

983
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:14,713
Danielle.

984
01:17:15,273 --> 01:17:15,493
Yes.

985
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:16,413
Anthony.

986
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:17,414
Yes.

987
01:17:18,674 --> 01:17:18,954
Ron.

988
01:17:19,894 --> 01:17:20,214
Yes.

989
01:17:21,155 --> 01:17:21,555
Phyllis.

990
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:22,335
Yes.

991
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:23,815
Aubrey.

992
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:26,516
No, but I like the spirit.

993
01:17:29,076 --> 01:17:29,436
Jean.

994
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:30,357
Yes.

995
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:33,317
Paulette.

996
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,078
Yes.

997
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:38,419
One person I'm missing.

998
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:38,920
Me.

999
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,161
Eunice.

1000
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:40,982
Eunice, thank you.

1001
01:17:41,002 --> 01:17:41,422
Yes.

1002
01:17:41,963 --> 01:17:42,724
Yes, okay.

1003
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:48,730
I want to say Milva's done an incredible job of missing a different person each time, so that's very good.

1004
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,172
Thank you, Ron.

1005
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:53,315
That's why she should pick the committees.

1006
01:17:54,976 --> 01:17:55,877
It takes talent.

1007
01:17:56,862 --> 01:17:58,003
Okay, we're going on.

1008
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,324
So we've done the ordinance review.

1009
01:17:59,364 --> 01:17:59,784
Yay.

1010
01:18:00,104 --> 01:18:02,346
Can I just add 1 thing?

1011
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:04,107
Okay, here we go.

1012
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:11,072
Sorry, going back to similar to what we were talking about a while ago.

1013
01:18:13,153 --> 01:18:20,278
My language was the mayor shall establish a page on the city website for the ordinance review committee.

1014
01:18:20,919 --> 01:18:32,186
Any recommendations shall be made available on the designated page on the city website as well as made available in hard copy form at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of the reproduction.

1015
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:32,987
Can we add that in?

1016
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:40,152
Can we just say, tell the call-in center that we want this section to reflect- Electronic means, yeah.

1017
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:41,361
Okay.

1018
01:18:41,581 --> 01:18:42,922
Same thing we're saying for the other one?

1019
01:18:43,642 --> 01:18:43,842
Yes.

1020
01:18:44,582 --> 01:18:44,942
Okay.

1021
01:18:47,483 --> 01:18:47,683
Okay.

1022
01:18:47,783 --> 01:18:48,883
We're in the 21st century.

1023
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:49,683
Yeah.

1024
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:50,324
Okay.

1025
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:50,824
Thanks.

1026
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:53,805
Now, next on the agenda, but we may have already covered it.

1027
01:18:53,885 --> 01:18:57,346
Was there anything about multi-member bodies other than the residency?

1028
01:18:59,386 --> 01:18:59,846
Oh, yeah.

1029
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:01,247
Okay.

1030
01:19:02,007 --> 01:19:02,327
Oh, no.

1031
01:19:03,985 --> 01:19:04,345
Sorry.

1032
01:19:05,346 --> 01:19:23,018
What I ended up doing was I spent, I don't know, a weekend ago or something going through a couple of dozen other charters and whatever general provisions or whatever section we're in now.

1033
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:30,864
I plucked out some things that I thought were helpful and relevant to us here in Medford.

1034
01:19:33,872 --> 01:19:38,596
The uniform procedures governing multi member bodies under the.

1035
01:19:39,097 --> 01:19:41,839
Meeting section.

1036
01:19:41,859 --> 01:19:45,002
Let's see, we find in.

1037
01:19:52,773 --> 01:19:58,401
And it's somewhat similar to what I've been saying.

1038
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:06,552
I have a few things under the multi-member body section, and I'm sorry to bore you all to tears.

1039
01:20:08,615 --> 01:20:16,422
and I'll pop this in chat as well, but the mayor shall designate a page on the city website for each board or commission.

1040
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:25,810
All meeting notices and agendas shall be posted there as well as to the city calendar in accordance with mass open meeting law.

1041
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:30,554
Medford Community Media shall be notified of all meetings.

1042
01:20:31,295 --> 01:20:36,281
Meetings shall be televised live pending availability at MCM.

1043
01:20:36,882 --> 01:20:41,207
All meetings shall be recorded and uploaded to MCM for replay.

1044
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:46,613
All minutes shall be approved and posted no later than 60 days after the meeting.

1045
01:20:47,757 --> 01:20:50,779
So we run into the same problem again.

1046
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:54,622
We don't know if Metro community media is going to exist for the next 10 years.

1047
01:20:55,202 --> 01:20:56,383
You know, it might change.

1048
01:20:56,403 --> 01:20:57,604
It might be something else.

1049
01:20:58,924 --> 01:21:05,569
We don't know what new electronic things going to come down the pike that maybe a website isn't a thing anymore.

1050
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:06,650
And I think that's what

1051
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:27,386
So I guess what I'm going to ask about this is, can we do what we're doing with all the other sections and just let the call-in center use language that won't sort of tie us into something that might not exist during the tenure of the charter?

1052
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:44,959
Yes, but a little bit different in this way in addition to ensuring that, you know, meeting notices and agendas go up on the website in the city calendar.

1053
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:51,022
And I'm not quite sure how to put it, but.

1054
01:21:52,652 --> 01:22:10,301
whatever means there is, and you can finesse this maybe for Collins Center, Milva, whatever means there are of broadcasting, I guess, would be the word that I would want.

1055
01:22:11,782 --> 01:22:15,864
Whatever means of broadcasting a meeting would be

1056
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:26,666
All meetings should be either live broadcast or recorded for replay.

1057
01:22:27,726 --> 01:22:28,066
OK.

1058
01:22:28,826 --> 01:22:46,272
So what I would like to do is just tell when we submit our draft charter and the parts of the charter that the Collins Center is going to write that we include, we want language in there to ensure that

1059
01:22:48,023 --> 01:23:04,456
these meetings are publicized by all means available, and that they're broadcast by all means available, and that they're shared by all means available, and let them come up with the language?

1060
01:23:04,716 --> 01:23:05,537
Does that sound?

1061
01:23:05,557 --> 01:23:09,320
Yeah, I'm amenable to that.

1062
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:14,244
We're going to talk about it again because we're going to get the draft charter back from the call-in center.

1063
01:23:14,404 --> 01:23:17,046
Then when we get it back from the call-in center,

1064
01:23:18,112 --> 01:23:20,513
they're going to be with us for the last three meetings.

1065
01:23:20,713 --> 01:23:22,574
So there'll be a chance to talk about it again.

1066
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:23,574
Okay.

1067
01:23:23,714 --> 01:23:28,616
And then I think the last piece, and I think, um, uh, Matthew, I think has left us.

1068
01:23:29,396 --> 01:23:35,758
Um, uh, but, uh, he had a note in the chat that I guess he wasn't too pleased with how things went about the minutes.

1069
01:23:36,838 --> 01:23:41,240
Um, but that I would, um, you know,

1070
01:23:43,099 --> 01:23:50,584
Uh, and I've, I've come across this to looking for minutes from some bodies is that, you know, they don't seem to be.

1071
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:55,467
You know, avail made available, so I think that having something.

1072
01:23:55,487 --> 01:24:00,330
In there that indicates that all minutes must be approved and posted.

1073
01:24:01,963 --> 01:24:04,685
And I just, I picked no later than 60 days.

1074
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:07,006
I'm pretty sure, isn't that an open meeting?

1075
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:12,309
I mean, I thought that that was outside the charter requirement.

1076
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:12,970
Now, whether.

1077
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:21,695
It is a state law, you know, the open meeting law and all the groups and committees are already supposed to be doing that.

1078
01:24:22,315 --> 01:24:22,555
Yeah.

1079
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:23,296
And they're not.

1080
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:24,256
Right.

1081
01:24:24,457 --> 01:24:26,898
So that's, I don't think we can control that.

1082
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:27,839
Okay.

1083
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:30,080
But Maury.

1084
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,742
Now, I was just going to say what Anthony said.

1085
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,624
That's state law.

1086
01:24:36,724 --> 01:24:46,591
And if you've got one person out of 60,000 people in the city that's a little bit upset how it goes, that is what it is.

1087
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:48,133
OK.

1088
01:24:48,173 --> 01:24:51,215
So let's let the call-in center put that language in.

1089
01:24:51,275 --> 01:24:56,319
And as I said, Eunice, we'll be able to address it again with them present.

1090
01:24:56,659 --> 01:24:59,542
And we can work through it if we need to.

1091
01:24:59,722 --> 01:25:00,362
Does that make sense?

1092
01:25:00,422 --> 01:25:00,983
Does that sound good?

1093
01:25:01,923 --> 01:25:12,433
Yeah, and then we covered the residency, and then I just had one other section that I found somewhere.

1094
01:25:12,493 --> 01:25:13,334
I can't remember where.

1095
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:14,936
No, why?

1096
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:15,896
Because you don't have it.

1097
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:16,277
Move on.

1098
01:25:18,016 --> 01:25:18,656
Thanks, Maury.

1099
01:25:20,137 --> 01:25:39,681
It says notice to mayor, a multi-member body may, by majority vote, send a notice to the mayor if the extended absence of one or more members is impeding the ability of such body to maintain a quorum, fulfill its responsibilities, or otherwise preventing the body from taking action in a timely manner.

1100
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:43,903
That then puts a stop to cases where

1101
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:55,323
you know, there may be members that are not, you know, get appointed to a body and aren't showing up.

1102
01:25:56,124 --> 01:26:04,027
Um, you know, I know that that came up quite recently in another body and, uh, you know, uh, okay.

1103
01:26:04,828 --> 01:26:08,469
So do you want to make a motion to add that, uh, make a motion to add that?

1104
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:13,291
And I will, um, uh, get you the language of the second.

1105
01:26:14,512 --> 01:26:14,832
Okay.

1106
01:26:16,633 --> 01:26:19,194
Do people need to see the language before they vote on it?

1107
01:26:19,815 --> 01:26:20,135
Jean.

1108
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:32,784
I feel like this was already covered, but I just want to check and make sure it's not in Section 2 or wherever we talk about multi-member bodies.

1109
01:26:32,884 --> 01:26:39,389
It's possible, but I don't recall this in particular being there, but if you want to look, you can.

1110
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:42,010
I will try to look that up.

1111
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,172
I just added it to the chat, Jean.

1112
01:26:47,668 --> 01:26:48,849
I don't see it.

1113
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:50,190
Oh, there we go.

1114
01:26:55,154 --> 01:26:57,876
So that's what's on the table.

1115
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:03,560
And do we have a second?

1116
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:13,598
I'll second it.

1117
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:14,679
Okay.

1118
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,540
Um, okay.

1119
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:17,641
Let's vote.

1120
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,102
Uh, Eunice?

1121
01:27:21,023 --> 01:27:21,343
Uh, yes.

1122
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:22,884
Uh, Paulette?

1123
01:27:23,264 --> 01:27:23,485
Yes.

1124
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:24,805
Uh, Ron?

1125
01:27:26,306 --> 01:27:26,747
Uh, no.

1126
01:27:28,388 --> 01:27:29,048
Uh, Aubrey?

1127
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:32,130
Let me come back.

1128
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:32,990
I'm still reading it.

1129
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:33,531
Okay.

1130
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:35,552
Um, Jean?

1131
01:27:40,015 --> 01:27:40,095
Uh,

1132
01:27:41,891 --> 01:27:42,771
Yes, I guess.

1133
01:27:45,813 --> 01:27:46,193
Maury.

1134
01:27:46,753 --> 01:27:48,634
Yes.

1135
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:49,075
Anthony.

1136
01:27:51,876 --> 01:27:55,198
I haven't had a chance to read it, so I'll abstain.

1137
01:27:57,619 --> 01:27:58,059
Okay.

1138
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:00,941
Who did I miss?

1139
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:01,921
I got Ron.

1140
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:04,222
Danielle.

1141
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:06,863
And somebody else different.

1142
01:28:07,564 --> 01:28:08,724
Danielle says yes.

1143
01:28:10,929 --> 01:28:12,251
And you didn't get me, Milva.

1144
01:28:12,851 --> 01:28:13,412
And Phyllis?

1145
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:14,532
I'm abstaining.

1146
01:28:15,353 --> 01:28:15,794
Okay.

1147
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:17,135
And Aubrey?

1148
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,096
Is still reading?

1149
01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:23,901
I think I just don't understand what send a notice would do.

1150
01:28:24,681 --> 01:28:27,604
Yeah.

1151
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:28,545
I'm going to vote no.

1152
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:39,468
I mean, basically telling the mayor that, hey, we've got a member that's not shown up for the last four meetings.

1153
01:28:39,488 --> 01:28:41,530
That's what it sounds like to me.

1154
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:44,472
We can't make a quorum because.

1155
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:46,674
I don't see why they couldn't do that already.

1156
01:28:52,138 --> 01:28:54,180
That's how I read it.

1157
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:58,303
It's just saying that they can send a notice to the mayor about this.

1158
01:29:01,843 --> 01:29:04,404
It doesn't say anything is going to be done about it.

1159
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,345
Well, true.

1160
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:08,006
Good point.

1161
01:29:08,026 --> 01:29:10,788
It doesn't say someone's going to be taken off of it either.

1162
01:29:10,828 --> 01:29:12,509
It's just saying, how are you going to handle it?

1163
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:18,432
I mean, I've missed two or three meetings over the last two or three months, but- You're out, Maury.

1164
01:29:18,472 --> 01:29:18,892
You're out.

1165
01:29:18,912 --> 01:29:19,372
You're out.

1166
01:29:19,452 --> 01:29:19,952
I'm gone.

1167
01:29:20,012 --> 01:29:20,593
I'm gone.

1168
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,074
So Aubrey- I can't be here for the rest of my life.

1169
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:25,355
Aubrey's a no.

1170
01:29:25,535 --> 01:29:25,855
Okay.

1171
01:29:26,216 --> 01:29:30,498
So we have five yes, three no, two abstain, so the motion passes.

1172
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:31,653
Okay.

1173
01:29:34,174 --> 01:29:35,895
That was all from multi-member bodies.

1174
01:29:36,255 --> 01:29:41,436
Were we going to do anything about the periodic review of the need for multi-member bodies?

1175
01:29:41,496 --> 01:29:44,998
Yeah, that would be another because you wanted to add that.

1176
01:29:45,358 --> 01:30:00,343
I think there was a note from the Collins Center on that, and the Collins Center felt that they thought that you wouldn't necessarily need it if we were doing an ordinance review, but they also had a suggestion.

1177
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:08,184
which was not about putting something in the charter, right?

1178
01:30:09,164 --> 01:30:11,846
Yeah, it was about, I think, bringing it to the city council.

1179
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:20,750
I can't seem to find in front of me their note, but I believe it was to make a recommendation that

1180
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:28,368
I couldn't get papers, that the city clerk, right?

1181
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:29,589
Put it in the chat.

1182
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:30,429
I put it in the chat.

1183
01:30:30,449 --> 01:30:30,850
Thank you.

1184
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:33,111
Thank you, Jean.

1185
01:30:34,632 --> 01:30:36,333
OK, so let's look at it.

1186
01:30:38,374 --> 01:30:41,837
If I can scroll down to the last chat.

1187
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:43,298
Here we go.

1188
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:57,255
recommend that a city official like the city clerk produce an annual report to the city council regarding the need and operation of all currently existing multi-member bodies.

1189
01:30:57,595 --> 01:30:59,256
So we could do something like that.

1190
01:31:00,517 --> 01:31:11,222
Or if you want Eunice to make a motion about adding this section to the charter about having a review of the need for multi-member bodies, you can do that.

1191
01:31:12,063 --> 01:31:12,283
Jean.

1192
01:31:13,557 --> 01:31:15,499
Is this addressing a problem we have?

1193
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:21,746
Do we have multi member bodies that exist that we don't need or that aren't meeting?

1194
01:31:21,766 --> 01:31:25,750
I think I was I was looking actually at the.

1195
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,911
uh, listing of our current boards and commissions.

1196
01:31:30,971 --> 01:31:35,352
I think we have a couple on there that seem to be a bit questionable.

1197
01:31:35,872 --> 01:31:41,553
Um, and then there were a few that were on there that I've seen on there before that seemed to have disappeared.

1198
01:31:41,573 --> 01:31:43,513
So maybe they've disbanded.

1199
01:31:43,633 --> 01:31:55,796
I, I think that, um, Marilonga Kern has, you know, one of her missions, um, it seems over the last, you know, few years has been to, you know,

1200
01:31:57,727 --> 01:32:02,931
take a look at the multi-member bodies, take a look at the boards and clean things up.

1201
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:09,677
So it appears that she's done some of that, but she's not going to be the mayor forever.

1202
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:24,768
But I think, yeah, I would be okay with how much Tim would recommend

1203
01:32:27,457 --> 01:32:31,400
a designated city clerk maybe to produce an annual report.

1204
01:32:32,701 --> 01:32:48,173
Yeah, I would be okay with what the Collins Center recommends, presuming the clerk will go through and boards that seem to be meeting on a regular basis should obviously serve a purpose.

1205
01:32:48,953 --> 01:32:52,536
If there's a board there that the last time they met was 18 months ago,

1206
01:32:53,978 --> 01:32:56,680
They don't seem to serve the purpose any longer.

1207
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:04,246
So I think as long as there's something, again, as I said, you know, about other stuff, it's housekeeping.

1208
01:33:06,328 --> 01:33:11,853
And I think that if there's some form of housekeeping in there, I think that's okay.

1209
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,756
So I would be okay with what the call and sender says.

1210
01:33:15,776 --> 01:33:18,398
Jean, do you have another comment?

1211
01:33:19,463 --> 01:33:26,966
Well, I, I think we're, we do need housekeeping I just, and full disclosure the city clerks my neighbor.

1212
01:33:26,986 --> 01:33:29,707
And I just know how.

1213
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:38,511
I just don't want to create a lot of bureaucracy for people that if it's not needed I just worry about putting a lot more work on people.

1214
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:45,925
And so I wonder if it could be a regular review with unstated or does it have to be annual report to the city council?

1215
01:33:45,965 --> 01:33:55,376
Can it be bi-annual or something so that we're, I just don't want to create a lot of busy work for people if it isn't, I see what you're saying, Eunice.

1216
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,758
I'm not saying it's not important.

1217
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:57,138
I just.

1218
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,002
Okay, Ron, did you have a comment?

1219
01:34:00,523 --> 01:34:08,906
Yeah, just quickly, the first part of where they say that no charter has this is interesting, but the other thing too is- Well, they said they couldn't find one.

1220
01:34:09,046 --> 01:34:10,266
No, no, I get it.

1221
01:34:10,286 --> 01:34:12,647
This actually came out of Fall River, I believe.

1222
01:34:14,268 --> 01:34:19,269
My real point is the report gets printed out by the city clerk, then what happens?

1223
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:25,592
This only says make a report.

1224
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:27,352
Yes, that's right.

1225
01:34:28,393 --> 01:34:28,933
That's my point.

1226
01:34:39,422 --> 01:34:40,462
Where do we want to go with this?

1227
01:34:43,685 --> 01:34:57,075
An annual report to the city council regarding the need and operation in order to determine if there are any boards that should be disbanded.

1228
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,441
Well, I understand that.

1229
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,482
But they don't have the authority to do that.

1230
01:35:03,783 --> 01:35:05,043
Yeah.

1231
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:10,966
So I guess what we're talking about now is something put in the final report, not the actual draft charter.

1232
01:35:11,066 --> 01:35:21,611
So if we're deciding that we don't want to put this in the charter and we'll enable something for the final report, then we don't have to go through the nitpicking of it right now.

1233
01:35:21,671 --> 01:35:23,191
We can do that at another meeting.

1234
01:35:23,652 --> 01:35:24,312
Does that make sense?

1235
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:29,251
If that's what we're deciding, that we're going to do that.

1236
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:32,193
We're going to put something, we're going to put a recommendation in the final report.

1237
01:35:33,675 --> 01:35:34,475
I'm okay with that.

1238
01:35:34,956 --> 01:35:35,276
Okay.

1239
01:35:35,456 --> 01:35:39,200
And then we'll finagle that, the details of it down the road.

1240
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:39,960
Okay.

1241
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,783
Um, is that it for multi-member bodies?

1242
01:35:43,684 --> 01:35:44,004
Uh, yeah.

1243
01:35:44,825 --> 01:35:45,185
Okay.

1244
01:35:45,565 --> 01:35:48,067
Now you said had something in oaths or affirmations.

1245
01:35:49,148 --> 01:35:50,770
Uh, it was just a minor change.

1246
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,152
Um, uh,

1247
01:35:55,710 --> 01:36:15,625
The way our, in the first couple of sentences, the way that reads, a mayor-elect, the city council members-elect, and school committee members-elect shall, on the first Monday after the first Tuesday in January of each even-numbered year, meet and swear the faithfully discharged.

1248
01:36:16,066 --> 01:36:23,712
Our current charter reads, there shall be a mayor elected by and for the,

1249
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:34,445
and this goes for the other bodies as well, shall hold office for the term of two years from the first Monday of January following his election.

1250
01:36:34,465 --> 01:36:37,327
So not the first Monday after the first Tuesday.

1251
01:36:37,407 --> 01:36:41,589
Again, I'll just say that this was just an example for us to see what's in this section.

1252
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:51,535
If this is mostly standard language and the call-in center will draft it, and the call-in center, one of the things that they're going to do when they draft the charter is make sure the language is all consistent.

1253
01:36:52,016 --> 01:36:54,277
So when we get the actual complete

1254
01:36:54,437 --> 01:36:56,344
lead a draft charter from the call and center.

1255
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:59,193
If there's still a conflict, then can we deal with it then?

1256
01:36:59,213 --> 01:36:59,273
Yes.

1257
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:00,498
Okay.

1258
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,943
OK, awesome.

1259
01:37:04,523 --> 01:37:05,944
OK, the public comment.

1260
01:37:06,324 --> 01:37:08,765
Addition of section on public comment.

1261
01:37:09,005 --> 01:37:14,568
I think Ron had something under the limitation in office all day.

1262
01:37:15,088 --> 01:37:16,169
You want to do that next?

1263
01:37:17,489 --> 01:37:21,571
OK, so again, this is just an example charter that we used.

1264
01:37:21,911 --> 01:37:31,536
And Ron had flagged this because he wanted to discuss this waiver option, which I am told by the call-in center is actually not common.

1265
01:37:32,277 --> 01:37:35,761
So apparently Melrose does it, but it's not common.

1266
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:51,999
They theorize that one of the reasons for including the waiver would be just to not limit because it's hard sometimes to get people and this could

1267
01:37:53,694 --> 01:37:58,659
maybe address that, but it is not a common provision.

1268
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:05,566
They probably would not have included it if we were just saying draft that with standard language.

1269
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:14,963
But now that we are actually looking at an example that has it in it, the question arises, do we want that in there or not?

1270
01:38:15,303 --> 01:38:16,884
Ron does not want it, correct?

1271
01:38:16,944 --> 01:38:18,866
Well, can I just say a couple of words on this?

1272
01:38:18,886 --> 01:38:20,247
Yeah, go ahead.

1273
01:38:20,367 --> 01:38:21,528
These are employees.

1274
01:38:21,608 --> 01:38:23,029
These are not board members.

1275
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:23,810
Yes.

1276
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:24,771
First, number one.

1277
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:29,634
Number two is either you have the rule or you don't.

1278
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:34,799
But you don't have the rule and one person can change the rule just by a wish.

1279
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:36,880
So there has to be something that says,

1280
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:41,023
The rule is you can't hold two employment positions in the city.

1281
01:38:42,344 --> 01:38:47,207
Now, if you think there should be exceptions to that, then the mayor can go to the city council and get approval.

1282
01:38:47,227 --> 01:38:48,687
But there's no balance here.

1283
01:38:49,148 --> 01:38:54,651
The balance is, well, I'm going to give you, you can be the parking person, you could be the, I just have to fill it up.

1284
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:56,472
This is nothing about the rules.

1285
01:38:56,552 --> 01:39:01,195
So it's either you have this rule or you have a way of going around it.

1286
01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:06,057
And I just think it's very, very too much power in one way.

1287
01:39:10,156 --> 01:39:10,676
You're on mute.

1288
01:39:13,977 --> 01:39:21,379
The history is once upon a time, Bill Brady, who worked for the DPW, ran for school committee, was elected to school committee.

1289
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:27,280
At that point, he had to quit his DPW job in order to continue.

1290
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:34,862
I think that the reason to have it is because otherwise, I'm mayor, and I'm, you know, I'm being,

1291
01:39:35,682 --> 01:39:50,713
negative at this point and certainly not thinking about any particular mayor, but a mayor could then get employees to run for school committee and city council and perhaps have greater power.

1292
01:39:51,634 --> 01:39:53,695
So you're saying that's a reason not to have the waiver?

1293
01:39:54,336 --> 01:39:54,556
Right.

1294
01:39:54,876 --> 01:39:57,458
Oh, it's a reason not to have the waiver.

1295
01:39:57,838 --> 01:39:58,159
Okay.

1296
01:39:58,959 --> 01:39:59,139
So

1297
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:03,983
Does anybody see a reason to have the waiver?

1298
01:40:05,004 --> 01:40:08,267
Is this, I'm sorry, we're not having the opportunity to see it.

1299
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:12,671
Is this elected office and the job or is it just two jobs?

1300
01:40:14,293 --> 01:40:15,394
Any two city jobs?

1301
01:40:16,347 --> 01:40:19,748
Well, it says one city office or position of employment.

1302
01:40:19,809 --> 01:40:28,732
So it could be a city office, which I interpret to be an elected office or a position of employment.

1303
01:40:29,292 --> 01:40:34,334
So the limitation on office holding is standard in the charter.

1304
01:40:34,835 --> 01:40:41,137
What is not standard is a waiver, but we happen to be looking at a charter that includes it.

1305
01:40:42,478 --> 01:40:43,378
I would vote no.

1306
01:40:43,838 --> 01:40:45,479
I would not want to have the waiver.

1307
01:40:47,063 --> 01:40:50,105
Okay, do we want to, um, does someone want to make a motion on this waiver?

1308
01:40:51,246 --> 01:40:53,108
I'll make a motion that we not include the waiver.

1309
01:40:53,128 --> 01:40:54,749
Okay, does somebody want a second?

1310
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:55,810
I second.

1311
01:40:57,291 --> 01:40:57,971
Uh, okay.

1312
01:40:57,991 --> 01:40:59,172
I have a question.

1313
01:40:59,652 --> 01:41:00,553
Yep, go ahead, Aubrey.

1314
01:41:02,274 --> 01:41:12,041
Just thinking, are there part-time city office and positions of employment where this would, where two of them would equal one full-time?

1315
01:41:13,682 --> 01:41:14,583
That's a good question.

1316
01:41:16,694 --> 01:41:19,235
Yeah, that could be impacted.

1317
01:41:20,935 --> 01:41:21,876
Could you say that again?

1318
01:41:21,896 --> 01:41:39,081
I was thinking about if not all rules are full-time rules, so somebody could be in two part-time roles, or much less than part-time roles.

1319
01:41:42,622 --> 01:41:43,923
See, that's what I'm not sure.

1320
01:41:46,921 --> 01:42:00,409
If it's two jobs, like employment, like can you be a DPW worker and a facilities person, say, at the high school, two part-time jobs, I think that we should allow that.

1321
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:08,133
But if it's being on the school committee and being the head of the DPW, we shouldn't.

1322
01:42:08,273 --> 01:42:09,053
That's a no-go.

1323
01:42:09,774 --> 01:42:15,537
But to have two part-time jobs working for the same city, I think

1324
01:42:17,354 --> 01:42:22,823
should be, people should have the opportunity if they want to do something like that.

1325
01:42:24,165 --> 01:42:26,409
But when it says one city office,

1326
01:42:27,797 --> 01:42:28,718
That's what I mean.

1327
01:42:28,758 --> 01:42:29,719
What does office mean?

1328
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:31,741
Is it elected office?

1329
01:42:31,761 --> 01:42:35,984
That implies to me that this is about an elected office.

1330
01:42:36,545 --> 01:42:38,306
Yes, I think that is what it implies.

1331
01:42:38,787 --> 01:42:48,255
So I think the thing that Aubrey brings up is a good point, but how is it usual for somebody to work at two part-time jobs for the same city?

1332
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:53,503
I don't think that this has anything to do with two part-time jobs.

1333
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:56,967
I think this has to do with being an elected member to the city council.

1334
01:42:57,007 --> 01:42:59,909
And can you also be a DPW worker?

1335
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:06,135
Well, it says no person shall simultaneously hold more than one city office or position of employment.

1336
01:43:06,155 --> 01:43:09,278
So to me, it says you can only hold one position of employment.

1337
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:10,560
Right?

1338
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:10,640
Ron?

1339
01:43:13,776 --> 01:43:16,237
Yeah, I think everybody's making really good points.

1340
01:43:16,277 --> 01:43:21,358
I think it's more of getting two paychecks for two different jobs no matter how many hours.

1341
01:43:21,998 --> 01:43:23,458
I just want to be clear.

1342
01:43:23,618 --> 01:43:25,138
I'm not against the waiver.

1343
01:43:25,438 --> 01:43:31,000
I'm against one person being able to say what the waiver is without having to give a reason just documented.

1344
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,740
That's what I'm strongly against.

1345
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,481
I mean, if we find that somebody's, you know,

1346
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:47,127
doing two jobs and there's a justified reason for a waiver, it just can't be one person saying, well, yeah, sure, you got it.

1347
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:51,108
You can be the- So how do you think the waiver should be implemented?

1348
01:43:51,128 --> 01:44:00,211
Well, personally, I think it should be one, but I think that I'm open to the waiver should be a vote of the city council on a resolution from the mayor.

1349
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:04,272
Okay, so this section may be waived by the mayor,

1350
01:44:05,444 --> 01:44:11,589
blah, blah, blah, subject to a two-thirds vote of the city council.

1351
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:14,951
I'd just like to say one thing, please.

1352
01:44:15,652 --> 01:44:21,997
Francis also made a point that some of this would be governed by ethics laws and ethics.

1353
01:44:23,878 --> 01:44:34,807
Just to the point, and maybe someone knows this or not, but do not some of our teachers also work in after-school programs?

1354
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:40,771
And wouldn't that be two different jobs?

1355
01:44:42,191 --> 01:44:42,551
Maybe.

1356
01:44:48,233 --> 01:44:49,374
Yeah, that could be a problem.

1357
01:44:51,254 --> 01:44:54,075
I don't think that that's the intent of this, though.

1358
01:44:54,875 --> 01:45:00,317
It's not, but we've got to make sure that we don't accidentally do that.

1359
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:03,938
But it's limitation on office holding is the section.

1360
01:45:05,947 --> 01:45:06,707
It says or.

1361
01:45:07,508 --> 01:45:11,449
No, but they said it's it's section 911 limitation on office holding.

1362
01:45:11,489 --> 01:45:12,589
So that is the intent.

1363
01:45:12,689 --> 01:45:19,511
So I think that's so you can't work for the DPW and gene the on the school committee.

1364
01:45:19,531 --> 01:45:20,311
Yes, that's correct.

1365
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:28,434
Can we make clear what our intent is for this with the call in center and asked him to craft it a little better?

1366
01:45:30,799 --> 01:45:35,061
Like I said, I'm pretty sure they would just leave the first sentence.

1367
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:38,803
That's the standard because they said the waiver is unusual.

1368
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:51,010
I do think Paulette is right that the intent of this is just to say that there's a limitation on office holding that you can't.

1369
01:45:53,852 --> 01:45:56,876
I think that the stuff that we're talking about wouldn't really apply.

1370
01:45:57,477 --> 01:45:58,138
That's what I think.

1371
01:45:58,698 --> 01:46:00,641
Yeah, I agree, given the heading.

1372
01:46:01,082 --> 01:46:01,362
Yeah.

1373
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:07,750
So Ron, if we're talking only about office holding, do you still think that it's okay for there to be a waiver?

1374
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:14,779
I think a waiver, to me, a waiver is an exceptional scenario.

1375
01:46:15,139 --> 01:46:18,562
There may be a reason why somebody deserves a waiver.

1376
01:46:19,142 --> 01:46:21,104
It just can't be one person saying it.

1377
01:46:21,244 --> 01:46:25,588
So I'm trying to be open to the folks who want to talk about waivers.

1378
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:30,429
and say, if you're going to have a waiver, you've got to really go through these steps to get me a waiver.

1379
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,570
I mean, I don't know what the scenario is.

1380
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:35,851
I think sentence one tells the story.

1381
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:41,233
I just think when you dilute it by saying the mayor has the right to waive that, it's like, why put the law in at all?

1382
01:46:42,294 --> 01:46:54,778
So I just want to go back to a motion that Paulette made not to give the mayor, not to include the waiver, the waiver power for the mayor, regardless of how it's applied.

1383
01:46:55,763 --> 01:46:58,664
Are you still okay with that motion, Paula?

1384
01:46:58,684 --> 01:46:58,764
I am.

1385
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:18,533
Again, when it happened in real time, and I got along very well with Bill Brady over the years, even though we were very different people, but it would have put me in the position of if the mayor could make this waiver and subject to two-thirds vote of the city council.

1386
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:24,156
Let's say it was city council having to decide against someone who was elected,

1387
01:47:25,617 --> 01:47:27,738
It gets, it could get really tricky.

1388
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:34,283
And especially because the waiver could be for city council.

1389
01:47:34,803 --> 01:47:35,043
Right?

1390
01:47:35,343 --> 01:47:37,005
So, I just kind of think that it.

1391
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:40,371
You know, was it difficult?

1392
01:47:41,271 --> 01:47:47,333
Bill decided to give up his job and be on the city, on the school committee.

1393
01:47:48,113 --> 01:47:49,453
People know it going in.

1394
01:47:50,814 --> 01:47:57,396
It does mean that, you know, someone who works for the city isn't an elected official of the city.

1395
01:48:00,337 --> 01:48:03,918
But I think that's, you know, in terms of conflict of interest, I think that's,

1396
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:15,725
being a, depending on what their role is, but being someone who's on the, it could certainly bring up a conflict of interest.

1397
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:16,725
Okay.

1398
01:48:17,105 --> 01:48:21,267
So I'm going to hear from Maury and Aubrey and then we're going to vote.

1399
01:48:21,387 --> 01:48:23,749
I'm going to second Paulette's motion.

1400
01:48:23,809 --> 01:48:24,129
Okay.

1401
01:48:24,529 --> 01:48:24,789
Great.

1402
01:48:25,369 --> 01:48:25,710
Aubrey.

1403
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:32,833
Just sharing that if we're limited to office holding, then everything I've said, I don't have a problem with this.

1404
01:48:34,813 --> 01:48:45,076
The motion on the table is to not give the mayor any waiver power on the limitation on office holding.

1405
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:46,476
Paulette?

1406
01:48:47,296 --> 01:48:47,556
Yes.

1407
01:48:48,297 --> 01:48:48,677
Aubrey?

1408
01:48:49,417 --> 01:48:49,657
Yes.

1409
01:48:50,317 --> 01:48:50,637
Ron?

1410
01:48:51,377 --> 01:48:51,677
Yes.

1411
01:48:52,838 --> 01:48:53,118
Eunice?

1412
01:48:53,658 --> 01:48:53,978
Yes.

1413
01:48:55,358 --> 01:48:55,998
Jean?

1414
01:48:56,599 --> 01:48:56,899
Yes.

1415
01:48:58,259 --> 01:48:58,699
Danielle?

1416
01:48:59,959 --> 01:49:00,199
Yes.

1417
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:01,340
Phyllis?

1418
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:02,100
Yes.

1419
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:04,100
Anthony?

1420
01:49:04,941 --> 01:49:05,301
Yes.

1421
01:49:07,302 --> 01:49:08,382
Who did I forget this time?

1422
01:49:08,863 --> 01:49:09,363
Me.

1423
01:49:09,563 --> 01:49:09,883
Eunice?

1424
01:49:10,063 --> 01:49:10,623
No.

1425
01:49:10,683 --> 01:49:11,384
No, I voted.

1426
01:49:12,224 --> 01:49:12,704
Maury.

1427
01:49:13,004 --> 01:49:13,485
Maury.

1428
01:49:13,545 --> 01:49:13,965
Maury.

1429
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:15,405
Yes.

1430
01:49:16,446 --> 01:49:16,946
Thank you.

1431
01:49:17,226 --> 01:49:18,047
I'm also yes.

1432
01:49:18,487 --> 01:49:19,487
Awesome.

1433
01:49:20,067 --> 01:49:20,348
All right.

1434
01:49:20,528 --> 01:49:21,848
We have 10 minutes.

1435
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,029
I know we're not going to make it through.

1436
01:49:24,049 --> 01:49:30,092
What I'm going to ask is, are people available to meet us next week?

1437
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:32,745
I can't.

1438
01:49:33,205 --> 01:49:34,125
I'm going to try to be.

1439
01:49:35,066 --> 01:49:37,566
You know how my schedule has been the last couple of months.

1440
01:49:37,906 --> 01:49:39,367
Can I have a show of hands?

1441
01:49:39,947 --> 01:49:43,447
Who's a yes for next week?

1442
01:49:44,068 --> 01:49:45,528
Are we talking next Thursday?

1443
01:49:46,128 --> 01:49:46,368
Yeah.

1444
01:49:46,388 --> 01:49:46,368
1, 2, 3.

1445
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:52,069
I'm going to try.

1446
01:49:52,089 --> 01:49:53,610
I'm going to try.

1447
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:54,150
I can't guarantee it.

1448
01:49:56,727 --> 01:50:01,032
So if, so I think we'll have a quorum.

1449
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:05,617
So even if you're maybe, are you got, are the rest of you definites?

1450
01:50:08,741 --> 01:50:10,122
I'll probably be down the Cape.

1451
01:50:10,162 --> 01:50:15,504
I've never tried to Zoom at our Cape place, but assuming that I don't have technological difficulties.

1452
01:50:15,604 --> 01:50:19,285
If it works for Ron in Brewster, it should work for me in New Seabury.

1453
01:50:20,385 --> 01:50:32,430
The rest of what we have to talk about is the addition of a section on public comment, the addition of a section on conflict of interest, ethics, etc, the addition of a section on property,

1454
01:50:34,183 --> 01:50:40,648
And then just a little bit of a wrap up on talking about, I guess maybe I'll ask people now since most everybody's here.

1455
01:50:41,748 --> 01:50:47,092
So far for the final report committee, it's me and Gene and maybe Phyllis.

1456
01:50:48,713 --> 01:50:49,534
Does anybody else?

1457
01:50:49,694 --> 01:50:53,897
Can you explain the expectation of that committee and the timeline?

1458
01:50:54,537 --> 01:50:55,398
That's okay.

1459
01:50:55,438 --> 01:51:02,743
So what we would do is we would meet, I don't know how many times, we're just going to have to see

1460
01:51:04,207 --> 01:51:08,310
In July and August, but my aim would be to try to finish the final report.

1461
01:51:09,031 --> 01:51:17,498
By the end of August, and I don't, you know, I thought whoever we have that's working on it at the 1st meeting.

1462
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:20,580
We would talk about how we wanted to structure it.

1463
01:51:20,741 --> 01:51:21,801
So, I mean, I'm.

1464
01:51:23,022 --> 01:51:25,904
I'm fine with writing, maybe somebody else is.

1465
01:51:27,646 --> 01:51:35,872
But I thought what first we would do is, you know, we have some examples of final reports, decide sort of what we're going to include in it and how we're going to do it.

1466
01:51:35,932 --> 01:51:38,494
So I'm sorry I'm not giving you a very clear answer.

1467
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:47,000
But basically, I guess the short answer is whoever is involved is going to decide at the first meeting how to divvy up the work.

1468
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:53,183
But it's going to involve figuring out how to structure it and writing.

1469
01:51:53,283 --> 01:51:55,964
So you could be involved in it and you may or may not do writing.

1470
01:51:56,224 --> 01:51:59,126
If that's not something you want to do, you could do something else.

1471
01:52:00,286 --> 01:52:01,967
But I don't know.

1472
01:52:02,107 --> 01:52:02,587
I'm sorry.

1473
01:52:03,088 --> 01:52:03,468
Melva?

1474
01:52:04,168 --> 01:52:04,468
Yes.

1475
01:52:06,649 --> 01:52:07,550
Monday's I'm off.

1476
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:15,265
I have a window in the afternoons every day at 3.30 till like 5, 5.30.

1477
01:52:16,346 --> 01:52:20,469
So you're saying if you were available, you would be willing to work?

1478
01:52:20,629 --> 01:52:23,791
I'd be happy to help and be part of it.

1479
01:52:24,492 --> 01:52:24,812
OK.

1480
01:52:25,052 --> 01:52:26,393
So the first thing I'm going to do.

1481
01:52:26,413 --> 01:52:28,415
I'm restricted on my times, as you well know.

1482
01:52:28,455 --> 01:52:28,575
Yeah.

1483
01:52:29,175 --> 01:52:37,502
The first thing I'm going to do when I know who's interested is send out a Google, a Google, a Doodle poll or just to try to see.

1484
01:52:38,326 --> 01:52:38,546
Yeah.

1485
01:52:39,186 --> 01:52:43,088
So, and then we'll meet and we'll talk about how we're going to put this together.

1486
01:52:43,988 --> 01:52:51,651
And then when we finish, because we are going to finish, we're going to be ready in October, we're going to, we send it, we give this to the mayor.

1487
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:58,194
And then it's the mayor's job to figure out how we present it to the, how it's presented to the city council.

1488
01:52:58,514 --> 01:53:03,916
But my assumption, I think there's a good chance she will include us in that process.

1489
01:53:04,657 --> 01:53:04,937
I'm sure.

1490
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:18,595
Yeah, so so, in terms of timeline, so here we are at the 13th of June, we're going to meet again next week and wrap this up and then the writing committee is going to get to work.

1491
01:53:19,248 --> 01:53:30,277
Yeah, so what's going to happen is when we wrap this up, I'm going to take all the sections we've drafted and all the decisions that we've made and put them in a document and give them to the call-in center.

1492
01:53:30,818 --> 01:53:33,020
And I'm probably going to ask for one person.

1493
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:37,363
I don't know, Aubrey, because you keep really good notes in the Google Docs.

1494
01:53:37,423 --> 01:53:42,067
And would you be willing to look at the document that I put together

1495
01:53:43,128 --> 01:53:50,529
Before I give it to the call-in center, just to say, oh, we talked about this or we voted on it.

1496
01:53:51,310 --> 01:53:52,630
I'd be happy to approve.

1497
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:54,930
Thank you.

1498
01:53:55,750 --> 01:54:00,391
I've told the call-in center that I would provide that for them by the end of the month and they said three weeks.

1499
01:54:00,411 --> 01:54:02,932
Let's just say maybe they'll take a month.

1500
01:54:09,413 --> 01:54:16,559
Theoretically, by the end of July, everybody, we would have a draft charter from the Collins Center.

1501
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:19,181
And then I would send that to everybody.

1502
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:22,564
And then our committee won't meet in July.

1503
01:54:24,025 --> 01:54:28,809
But you will be given the draft charter to read and prepare.

1504
01:54:28,989 --> 01:54:33,353
And then in August and September, we will meet with the Collins Center and go over

1505
01:54:34,258 --> 01:54:36,339
what they have come up with.

1506
01:54:36,979 --> 01:54:42,142
If we have any questions on sections, we'll be able to ask them about it.

1507
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:57,690
If they see anything in there that they think they should flag and say, well, is this what you meant to say here or whatever, we'll be able to work on that with them for two meetings and then

1508
01:54:58,968 --> 01:55:01,749
Meanwhile, the final report is separate from that.

1509
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:04,911
So that'll be the draft charter, and then there'll be the final report.

1510
01:55:05,451 --> 01:55:07,673
And that will be worked on by the final report committee.

1511
01:55:07,713 --> 01:55:12,355
So the final report committee will be working on that while the Collins Center is completing the draft.

1512
01:55:12,515 --> 01:55:13,876
Does that make sense?

1513
01:55:13,936 --> 01:55:15,937
Do you have the meeting dates in August?

1514
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:17,338
I know that's a big vacation.

1515
01:55:18,398 --> 01:55:34,241
Well, I would say our usual date, the first Thursday, or we could do a doodle poll, because I know people are, you know, and that might, if we met later in August, that might give people more, a little more time to read the draft charter too.

1516
01:55:34,962 --> 01:55:40,743
Do people want to just say the first Thursday in August, or do we want to just do a doodle poll and

1517
01:55:42,188 --> 01:55:58,407
see i'd like to wait and see when we get the draft charter from the collins center i mean okay i don't get it until like maybe it's a morning or maybe it's you know we can all get together in the morning from whatever 9 to 12 or whatever i mean okay so in august is august 1st

1518
01:56:01,723 --> 01:56:02,503
It's August 1st.

1519
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:02,983
OK.

1520
01:56:03,424 --> 01:56:04,484
So here's what we're going to do.

1521
01:56:04,744 --> 01:56:05,784
We're going to meet next week.

1522
01:56:05,864 --> 01:56:06,905
We're going to wrap this.

1523
01:56:08,145 --> 01:56:11,266
I'm going to create the document, send it to the Collins Center.

1524
01:56:11,306 --> 01:56:12,507
Aubrey's going to proof it for me.

1525
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:18,629
And then Maury, Gene, me, and Phyllis, so far, are on the final report committee.

1526
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:26,371
And then I will send out a doodle poll to those people, and we'll get together and talk about creating the final report.

1527
01:56:27,192 --> 01:56:29,072
I'll be in.

1528
01:56:29,132 --> 01:56:30,493
And everybody will have a break in July.

1529
01:56:31,788 --> 01:56:32,888
And then we'll have a push.

1530
01:56:32,908 --> 01:56:33,809
We'll have a big push.

1531
01:56:33,829 --> 01:56:38,070
We'll have a lot to do in August and September, but we're going to be done by October, so.

1532
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:40,251
Will there be ice cream at the August meetings?

1533
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:42,932
You know, that's a good question.

1534
01:56:43,112 --> 01:56:43,452
Maybe.

1535
01:56:43,552 --> 01:56:44,132
I'll join.

1536
01:56:45,252 --> 01:56:47,353
I'll join your committee if there's going to be ice cream.

1537
01:56:47,753 --> 01:56:50,914
Well, I don't know if they're virtual.

1538
01:56:51,835 --> 01:56:54,535
They're virtual, so yeah, it's going to be virtual ice cream.

1539
01:56:54,555 --> 01:56:56,856
Ice cream in your freezer?

1540
01:56:56,876 --> 01:56:59,077
In my house, jump in the pool, sit at the bar.

1541
01:56:59,902 --> 01:57:04,985
I mean, we could have a social, we could have an ice cream social, but we can't talk to our council.

1542
01:57:06,346 --> 01:57:09,428
And then what is our target date to present to the city council?

1543
01:57:10,008 --> 01:57:12,790
Well, I don't know, because that will be up to the mayor.

1544
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:24,036
You know, because we're submitting our final report and our draft charter to the mayor, and then it's kind of in the mayor's hands how, where to go from there.

1545
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:31,071
But I'm thinking it's going to, I mean, I'm assuming it will go.

1546
01:57:31,232 --> 01:57:32,832
I mean, we're shooting for October.

1547
01:57:32,932 --> 01:57:34,873
So, I mean, that's when we're going to give it to the mayor.

1548
01:57:35,093 --> 01:57:37,094
And I don't think it would take much longer after that.

1549
01:57:37,134 --> 01:57:37,754
That's my guess.

1550
01:57:39,574 --> 01:57:39,894
All right.

1551
01:57:40,115 --> 01:57:40,875
Does that sound good?

1552
01:57:41,815 --> 01:57:42,315
Sounds good.

1553
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:44,456
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1554
01:57:45,336 --> 01:57:45,776
All right.

1555
01:57:47,677 --> 01:57:50,638
Do we have public comment?

1556
01:57:50,998 --> 01:57:53,039
Yeah, let's see if we have any public comment.

1557
01:57:53,079 --> 01:57:55,880
Do we have any members of the public that would like to speak?

1558
01:57:59,713 --> 01:58:04,041
Okay so Maury made a motion to adjourn.

1559
01:58:04,983 --> 01:58:05,323
Second.

1560
01:58:05,884 --> 01:58:11,214
Great and all in favor okay I will send you all an agenda for next week and we will wrap.

1561
01:58:11,655 --> 01:58:12,135
Thank you.

1562
01:58:12,155 --> 01:58:12,917
Good night everyone.
