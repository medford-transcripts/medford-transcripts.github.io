1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:07,319
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to realize is that every time we turn around, scientists are saying, oh actually we were wrong, climate change is way worse than we thought.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need to look at everything through a lens of environmental justice.

3
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:17,851
[SPEAKER_00]: The Green Justice Coalition has the right idea which is to put together

4
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:28,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Marginalized communities of color that are most impacted by climate change with labor and environmental groups, and that is how we develop a Green New Deal.

5
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:34,726
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to commit to sourcing our electricity from 100% renewables by 2035 at the latest.

6
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,768
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to divest from fossil fuels.

7
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:43,770
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to convert government transportation to electric.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,071
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure that all new housing is passive housing, is zero emissions housing.

9
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:59,053
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, we are eventually going to have to have a plan for how are we going to switch our private transportation to electric?

10
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:06,075
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to retrofit all of our housing and commercial buildings so that they are not

11
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:10,356
[SPEAKER_00]: also emitting carbon emissions.

12
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:13,357
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very complex problem.

13
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:25,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the way we go about it is through a coalition of groups that really centralizes the voices of the people most impacted by climate change.

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:33,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to say that the people of Massachusetts are totally ready for this in every poll, willing to pay extra money for it.

15
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:35,044
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature is not ready.

16
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:42,248
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get rid of the concentration of power and the stranglehold that the speaker has over the state house, because that's how we can get this done.
