    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=0.532s">One</a>  thing to realize is that every time we turn around, scientists are saying, oh actually we were wrong, climate change is way worse than we thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=7.86s">So,</a>  we need to look at everything through a lens of environmental justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=14.527s">The</a>  Green Justice Coalition has the right idea which is to put together <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=19.613s">Marginalized</a>  communities of color that are most impacted by climate change with labor and environmental groups, and that is how we develop a Green New Deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=29.621s">We</a>  have to commit to sourcing our electricity from 100% renewables by 2035 at the latest. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=37.348s">We</a>  have to divest from fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=39.609s">We</a>  have to convert government transportation to electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=43.81s">We</a>  have to make sure that all new housing is passive housing, is zero emissions housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=50.391s">But</a>  more than that, we are eventually going to have to have a plan for how are we going to switch our private transportation to electric? <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=59.433s">How</a>  are we going to retrofit all of our housing and commercial buildings so that they are not <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=67.035s">also</a>  emitting carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=70.756s">And</a>  so it's a very complex problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=73.377s">And</a>  again, the way we go about it is through a coalition of groups that really centralizes the voices of the people most impacted by climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=86.36s">And</a>  I really want to say that the people of Massachusetts are totally ready for this in every poll, willing to pay extra money for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=93.624s">The</a>  legislature is not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/JLW5PPl1bsQ&t=95.765s">We</a>  have to get rid of the concentration of power and the stranglehold that the speaker has over the state house, because that's how we can get this done.</p>
