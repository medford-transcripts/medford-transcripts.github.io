00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, members of the board.

35
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:04,748
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Ian Hurtubise.

36
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:19,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an attorney from the law firm of Nutter, McLennan & Fish in Boston, and I'm representing the property owner here who, as stated, is seeking to put a cafe use in the ground floor of the building.

37
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:26,675
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a 700 square foot space, and we're seeking a tenant that ideally has coffee,

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,621
[SPEAKER_12]: breakfast items, maybe sandwiches at lunch, that type of thing.

39
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,342
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't mind, I can share my screen.

40
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:37,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I can show the boy the location and the building just to get a view.

41
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:40,105
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be great.

42
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:40,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

43
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:46,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

44
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:47,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Can everybody see this?

45
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:49,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

46
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:50,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

47
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is 640 Boston Ave here.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,201
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Sphere Apartments.

49
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:58,243
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a five story residential building with 42 units.

50
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:02,626
[SPEAKER_12]: It's located directly next to the Ball Square T Station.

51
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:03,767
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Tufts over here.

52
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:07,929
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Broadway in Somerville, just for orientation.

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,630
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what the building looks like.

54
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,453
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a slightly older picture, but this is the retail space here.

55
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,534
[SPEAKER_12]: 700 square feet.

56
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:21,378
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said, it had been a grocer prior to this, but, you know,

57
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:26,154
[SPEAKER_12]: property owner is really looking to have a more activated space here.

58
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:33,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe, you know, some folks coming from the building or coming and going from the T station can grab a cup of coffee or a bite to eat.

59
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:41,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And I should also note that I've got Paul Spivak, who's the property manager of the sphere apartments on the call as well.

60
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:48,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So should you have any questions, technical questions about the building or the use that, you know, he can help there as well.

61
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a,

62
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:57,404
[SPEAKER_12]: general floor plan of what this could look like, but you know, might be altered a bit for tenant specifications.

63
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:02,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I noted, you know, the type of tenant we like to have here.

64
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:15,737
[SPEAKER_12]: We've actually been in discussions with a local small business owner, you know, not a national engineer or anything, you know, just a more upstart business owner who'd like to ideally have this type of use here.

65
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:19,300
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of where we are in the process, but we haven't finalized anything yet.

66
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,530
[SPEAKER_12]: please, if you have any questions.

67
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:34,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if that concludes your presentation, Amanda, are there any comments from city staff on this matter?

68
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:42,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I lost my mute button.

69
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:48,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Danielle or Alicia, was there anything that context-wise we wanted to provide

70
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:55,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we did not, there's no written comments.

71
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,820
[SPEAKER_14]: It was more that this made complete sense to us.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,703
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually, when the filing first came in said, wait, this wasn't approved, like in their original filing.

73
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:18,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we actually double checked and we're like, oh yeah, no, it was very specific that the language they used and they didn't speculate that it could be something more broad like this.

74
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

75
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder why they didn't but that predates all of us.

76
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:26,657
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, it just it made sense to us.

77
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

78
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:35,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's open this up for public comment if we have any Amanda.

79
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:41,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me remind the members of the public if they wish to provide comments they can use the raise hand feature.

80
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,129
[SPEAKER_09]: They can get a message to Amanda in the comments there.

81
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,531
[SPEAKER_09]: They can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

82
00:06:55,294 --> 00:07:00,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any members of the public or hands raised at this point, Amanda?

83
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see any folks out there?

84
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,420
[SPEAKER_00]: No comments in the chat, and I'm not seeing any hands raised.

85
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'll give me a moment, I'll just check our office email.

86
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

87
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Not seeing comment at this time.

88
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:41,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

89
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:46,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's close that portion of the meeting and turn things over to the board.

90
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there questions for the applicant here?

91
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:02,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I guess I had a couple of just general questions.

92
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,132
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for 700 and something square feet.

93
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:10,196
[SPEAKER_09]: There was reference to more first floor for other uses.

94
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:25,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just sort of share the background on that or will we anticipate seeing you again, as you find potential prospective users for other first floor spaces in the building.

95
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul, can you can you jump in here?

96
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everybody.

97
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:38,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little confused as to other uses.

98
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:50,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're saying if this tenant goes out of business, there's actually no other retail space available for use in that in that first floor area besides this other 700 square foot space that we're referring to.

99
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's fine.

100
00:08:52,116 --> 00:09:09,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought I saw in the approvals, maybe I was going going back to the original approval that was a reference to a larger it might have even been a typo, but to, I think it was more like 7000 square feet on the first floor, that would be available so I just just wondered if there was more contemplated there but sounds like it's not.

101
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:10,522
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the only one.

102
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:12,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very good.

103
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:19,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other.

104
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions.

105
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'll just ask how I'm going to handle trash.

106
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:31,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Paul on that one as well.

107
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:35,966
[SPEAKER_05]: As with our previous tenant, we have trash pickup about two days a week.

108
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:40,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would just be part of that, that whole pickup system.

109
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:45,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would put their trash into our main trash room also on that same level.

110
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would just get picked up twice a week.

111
00:09:49,395 --> 00:10:05,700
[SPEAKER_05]: know we have a guest control that comes in monthly to March or anything that that should arise but you know the building is a very proud of the way the buildings kept so it's it's in great, great condition and I'll make sure that this is headed here is by all our rules as well.

112
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:06,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

113
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Absent any more discussion, is there a motion to recommend approval of the special permit to the city council.

114
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:30,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I just Christie, I make a motion to recommend approval to the city council.

115
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second, second, I'm happy to second.

116
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:42,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Amanda I'll let you rewind the tape and see who gets the dibs on on the second there.

117
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you both.

118
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:49,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's go to our roll call vote vice chair, Jackie McPherson.

119
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

120
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, Jason.

121
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:55,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

122
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrissy down.

123
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:58,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

124
00:10:59,114 --> 00:10:59,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter call this.

125
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I already got some fishermen.

126
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:03,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

127
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:05,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm an eye as well.

128
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

129
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.

130
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:28,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, next matter on the agenda is our continued discussion or meeting that had been continued from a public meeting on April 26 at 760 Felsway with raising canes.

131
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:40,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that attorney Desmond and raising canes team is here with updated information to share with us.

132
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,555
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

133
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening chairman Bloomberg and board members.

134
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: As you recall, we were last before the board on April 26.

135
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:59,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that time we introduced the project and received comments from the board, most of which have been incorporated into the revised plans that have been provided in advance of tonight's meeting.

136
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:09,660
[SPEAKER_08]: At the time of the initial meeting we were still working with the traffic engineer and engineering to resolve some comments that had been received.

137
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:22,650
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have a subsequent meeting with the city traffic engineer and I understand that the engineering team has also had had conversations with the city engineer concerning

138
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:24,359
[SPEAKER_08]: the comments.

139
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We submitted comments to both engineering and traffic.

140
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:35,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that the comments with respect to traffic have met with the satisfaction of Todd Blake.

141
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:45,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I did receive a message today that there were some residual conversations that needed to be had with the engineering team.

142
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,617
[SPEAKER_08]: with respect to the engineering comments.

143
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:55,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not quite certain as to what those comments are and where they arise specifically.

144
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:05,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt Ashley of the team had reached out to Owen when he contacted him and they essentially played telephone tag today.

145
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:16,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought that we were pretty well squared away at this point with engineering, but not exactly sure whether those concerns

146
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,934
[SPEAKER_08]: deal with the special permit for you so whether it's a construction

147
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,310
[SPEAKER_08]: permitting type issue that remains tonight.

148
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have an answer for the board tonight with respect to that.

149
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:34,732
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to that, we've also submitted a request for a special permit with respect to the extended hours.

150
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:44,513
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about that in terms of the loading requirements and that loading would be off hours and we would need a special permit from the city council.

151
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,594
[SPEAKER_08]: The city clerk invited us to file that.

152
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:55,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Ordinarily, it had been done after the initial hearing, but he indicated that we could include that within our petition.

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I've provided that to the board as well.

154
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:03,545
[SPEAKER_08]: It dovetails with our request for a waiver on the loading requirements.

155
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:11,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Unclear as to whether this board has to weigh in specifically with regard to that extended hours permit.

156
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:16,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask the board, I suppose, at this point to weigh in so that there's no issue in that regard.

157
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,541
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where we stand at this point.

158
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:22,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

159
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:24,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

160
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:29,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to, or have members of your team cover some of the details then?

161
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:30,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

162
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:35,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Eric, do you want to take us through the changes that you made to the plans?

163
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:38,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

164
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:38,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

165
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need permission to share screen from the host.

166
00:14:58,073 --> 00:14:58,573
[SPEAKER_00]: should be good.

167
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:03,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

168
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just sharing the color rendering of the updated site plan.

169
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:17,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the last time we met, we talked about kind of a red line sketch of what optimizing this area on the eastern bank side of the site was.

170
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:22,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've fully designed that out of the landscaping to that area.

171
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:29,391
[SPEAKER_10]: We're showing proposed crosswalks to connect the two sites and as well as across the drive aisle.

172
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So all this area has been updated since we last met.

173
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:38,619
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some requests to continue the landscaping along the eastern bank frontage.

174
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,961
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were just having consistent design there.

175
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've continued that across the eastern bank area.

176
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:55,546
[SPEAKER_10]: We've added a couple of landscape planters on the patio at the request of the board from the last meeting.

177
00:15:55,566 --> 00:16:02,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And those will be kind of at each side of the entrance to kind of end cap that entrance there.

178
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:07,417
[SPEAKER_10]: The EV charging station has been located on the site.

179
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:12,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll serve two parking spaces generally where my mouse is hovering.

180
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:25,820
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we added the geometry of the road changes, the active DCR roadway improvements that are actively happening onto the plan set, which is kind of where I'm highlighting here.

181
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And show generally what that sidewalk is going to do.

182
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:41,368
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is they're going to pave, actually all that the work is complete except for some loom and seating that needs to happen this imminently or could have happened in the past couple weeks since we've talked to them.

183
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the main, I think, board comments.

184
00:16:47,918 --> 00:17:02,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, from all the response to comment letters, we generally just updated the plans per request of engineering relative to water lines and all the engineering type stuff.

185
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:09,686
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, Kathy, do you think that's a high enough level or do you want me to get some very specific details on?

186
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:18,808
[SPEAKER_08]: The board whether they want to go into detail I mean we did provide the written comments, I don't know if they need that on the plan.

187
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:33,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but my suggestion is maybe is to leave at least this portion of it at that, and the board members can ask questions if if they're more interested in some finer details but thanks for coming.

188
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:42,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Pat, if you could address the traffic comments, I think that that was the other outstanding question that needed to be addressed at the meeting.

189
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, glad to.

190
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And good evening, everyone.

191
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:50,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Pat Dunford, transportation engineer with VHB.

192
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:56,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to keep this high level as well, be a little bit briefer than the last time we had spoken.

193
00:17:56,496 --> 00:18:00,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also need this hosting or screen sharing.

194
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It's currently disabled.

195
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,220
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone could help me with that.

196
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'll have to be extremely descriptive.

197
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Recording stopped.

198
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:21,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me, I don't know what happened there, but Pat, you should be able to go and I just need to resume.

199
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Recording in progress.

200
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:31,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And are we getting my screen just yet?

201
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:33,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

202
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:34,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.

203
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:38,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So Eric had just covered most of this, so I won't dwell on this too long.

204
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:43,777
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously the prior site layout, which we don't need to belabor.

205
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:53,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, he had just walked through the changes on the left side of the Raising Cane's parcel with the new landscape amenities and improved traffic flow.

206
00:18:54,521 --> 00:19:01,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I will note again, the drive-through layout is very unique and I'd say very efficient in that it has the double lane configuration.

207
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:11,428
[SPEAKER_01]: in which we can store up to 27 cars, which is more than we've seen at the multiple existing Raising Cane sites that we had looked at.

208
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:25,734
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked about that prior meeting, but I think tonight we want to focus a little bit more on some of the off-site coordination we had following meetings with department staff and the mobility group as well.

209
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,979
[SPEAKER_01]: We're obviously familiar with the site overview.

210
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,923
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the areas we had considered in our review.

211
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:45,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And the following graphic, this obviously gets a little bit busy, but that's just a function of there's a lot happening nearby here, both recently and in the future, and as well as some additional work that we just found out about.

212
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:59,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we don't have to hit all of them in super detail, but first and foremost, in the upper right corner, the DCR work at the intersection, Eric had just shown that plan and how that ties into the corner of our site.

213
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And that work is ongoing.

214
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:10,893
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we did talk with the mobility department about is we already were proposing that yellow kind of L shape that I have there.

215
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,556
[SPEAKER_01]: for the sidewalks going into the site.

216
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:27,576
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same token, we've since discovered that while they're doing, they being DCR frontage improvements along route 28, for whatever reason they were not planning and doing crosswalks across the site driveways.

217
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:31,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were going to ask as part of our work to pick that up.

218
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:42,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a heavy lift obviously but that would come with some pretty significant pedestrian benefits, which the mobility group had alerted us to and we certainly agree with that as well.

219
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:49,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one of those and I'll zoom into this one in a minute is the center driveway and route 28 where there's currently

220
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,999
[SPEAKER_01]: an enter only signal.

221
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:01,223
[SPEAKER_01]: They had pointed out as well that the crosswalks while being beneficial, there is a signal there which adds a certain degree of complexity to things.

222
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:05,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were also going to signalize the crossing of the driveway itself.

223
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:11,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll zoom into that in a second and show kind of how that works and what the benefits would be.

224
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:17,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, with the drive through use and raising canes in general,

225
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:34,220
[SPEAKER_01]: It is more automobile oriented, but through some of the site features we had shown, particularly the new connection going out to the sidewalk and Riverside Avenue and some of the internal amenities, we wanted to make sure this worked for pedestrians as well, because there's a lot of foot traffic in the area.

226
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:45,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, with some of the bike traffic, I know there's a recent project within the plaza that done some bike lane striping out there that's kind of faded.

227
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were going to clean that up as part of our work.

228
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:59,992
[SPEAKER_01]: One other item wayfinding signage and this ties in directly to the Riverside Avenue driveway where I know historically, there's been a lot of concerns there.

229
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:05,198
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked at that and through help of the city's mobility department.

230
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I think collectively we have a good solution there which I'll show you in a second.

231
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:15,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also trying to take advantage of the fact that there's an existing connection going from right next to raising canes.

232
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:30,402
[SPEAKER_01]: You can continue to the left or west behind Ocean State job lot and come out at the commercial street signal, avoiding the need for the more difficult unsignalized left turn out of that driveway onto Riverside.

233
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty simple, but also pretty effective.

234
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:34,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to promote that route

235
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,853
[SPEAKER_01]: to the extent possible just to minimize the amount of activity that close to the signal on Route 28.

236
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:52,140
[SPEAKER_01]: We also were going to be relocating or actually eliminating an existing crosswalk that's at a very awkward and quite frankly unsafe location on Riverside Avenue.

237
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,402
[SPEAKER_01]: We had talked about shifting that to the left, which is still going to happen.

238
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:00,725
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting part and one of the ongoing bits of work out here,

239
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:09,173
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's already planning on doing a roadway resurfacing project with some other features along Riverside Avenue in this area.

240
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:13,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going out to bid shortly and possibly could start this year.

241
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:17,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would already be picked up as part of that work but

242
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, with or without this project, that change is going to happen, which will be a much safer condition that's out there.

243
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:28,650
[SPEAKER_01]: To zoom in a little bit on some of these, step back a moment.

244
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,432
[SPEAKER_01]: This is heading northbound on route 28, and this is the center signalized.

245
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:36,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think you're changing your slides?

246
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:38,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, I hope so.

247
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:39,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.

248
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,915
[SPEAKER_14]: No, sorry.

249
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:43,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize maybe you didn't realize.

250
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:45,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

251
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:46,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on a second.

252
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:47,718
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try this again.

253
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:51,750
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'll have to be extremely descriptive like I talked about.

254
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize for interrupting so rudely.

255
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,033
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kind of glad you did.

256
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have made for a painful evening.

257
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we getting anything now with route 28?

258
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:00,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

259
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:01,177
[SPEAKER_09]: We see route 28.

260
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:01,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

261
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:02,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

262
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:03,138
[SPEAKER_01]: In all its glory.

263
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, sorry about that.

264
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:12,639
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking northbound on Route 28, this is the center signal to the property where you can turn left in only.

265
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:20,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left side, you can see the sidewalk between the two signals where there is no crosswalk striping there.

266
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:26,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the signalized entrance, that can be a little bit confusing, potentially a little bit unsafe.

267
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,507
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different angle of that.

268
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we now getting this view as well?

269
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I got my act together.

270
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:33,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.

271
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:41,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see there's no crosswalk across the driveway which seems pretty simple but in the absence of it it potentially could be dangerous.

272
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:50,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were going to restripe that, but also put in standard walk don't walk signal heads at this location, pending DCR approval.

273
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:57,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a state roadway so they have the final say but I think it's a pretty clear and efficient

274
00:24:57,806 --> 00:25:00,451
[SPEAKER_01]: pedestrian safety benefit that we were going to undertake.

275
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:05,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Not shown but in the background you can see there's a stop line as you enter the plaza.

276
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,587
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a one way enter driveway.

277
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:32,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And people being how people are sometimes it sometimes there's exiting traffic, which we don't want to see obviously so we're going to reinforce that with some do not enter striping some do not enter signs, just making it clear that this is an enter only location at that point, and you'll have a much better condition for both the cars and certainly the pedestrians crossing this driveway.

278
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one I don't think we need to get into this level of detail but

279
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:45,171
[SPEAKER_01]: At the city's request, we went out, took a look inside the signal controllers to make sure everything we're talking about is feasible, which it is.

280
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:52,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on to Riverside Avenue now, and I'll ask one final time if I'm showing the right plan, Riverside Avenue.

281
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:53,315
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

282
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, progress.

283
00:25:56,176 --> 00:26:03,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as I had mentioned, the city will be doing work out here, and as part of that, that crosswalk I had talked about was going to be relocated.

284
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:19,660
[SPEAKER_01]: The one kind of interesting thing is there's what's called do not block the box striping, diagonal striping on Riverside Avenue to make it clear if you're heading eastbound towards the signal not to stop and block the driveway.

285
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,321
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously uncomfortable if you ever accidentally do it.

286
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just wanted to reinforce that with that striping.

287
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:31,387
[SPEAKER_01]: What the city had pointed out was that clearly needed some sort of amplification.

288
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to do

289
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:42,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a ground level view of it where the striping is there, but it just needs to be reinforced a little, which it will be through the city project.

290
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:47,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also going to be installing what's called cue detectors under the pavement.

291
00:26:48,208 --> 00:27:06,487
[SPEAKER_01]: where when the traffic that backs up from the route 28 signal gets to probably around the area of the bank, that's going to trigger a sign that we're going to install on the other side of the intersection, an illuminated sign, essentially saying do not block the box or if the city wants it could be red signal ahead.

292
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:12,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But really something just to alert people more than a static, basic, boring sign.

293
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it illuminates, it really calls it out a lot more strongly.

294
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:19,872
[SPEAKER_01]: People are aware that something has changed and they need to react accordingly.

295
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That interactive signage could be very helpful here.

296
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:35,858
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we're going to undertake and it's actually something that'll entirely be under city control because this segment of Riverside Avenue is strictly a city roadway.

297
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:48,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we had put together a memorandum, um, I think last week to go over to the traffic department, it spelled out the various details of this beyond kind of the high level stuff.

298
00:27:48,714 --> 00:28:01,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I just walked through going through the exact type of signal, uh, equipment, the exact type of pavement and other treatments, just so we can show that it is something that can be built, uh, and is something that can be efficiently done, which it can be.

299
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:09,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to continue to work with the city to make sure that gets in a timely fashion in conjunction with the project.

300
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:26,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I will note that the route 28 work being under DC our jurisdiction is a little bit out of our control but I'm pretty optimistic that they'll see the benefits of that, and certainly allow that to go forward but we are going to be engaging them further along as we do that.

301
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:38,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that I think that kind of covers the new stuff since the prior meeting, but I'd be happy to attempt to show more slides and go back if you need more detail or more discussion.

302
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you for your time.

303
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:52,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks Mr. Dunford I just to clarify, and then I'll give the mic back to attorney Desmond but the things that you're summarizing and you covered with us with your slide presentation this evening.

304
00:28:55,073 --> 00:29:03,575
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that compare to the memo the memo may 12, you have a couple of sets of bullet points of particular things that are going to be done.

305
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:13,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you've done to sort of that would lend itself to a set of conditions that this board should consider as the ones that

306
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:18,448
[SPEAKER_09]: you're prepared to implement, if you will.

307
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:21,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's our expectation.

308
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we had talked with engineering and mobility.

309
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:36,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That I think was their expectation as well so our projects, more than happy to do these pending DCR approval and pending city staff approval, but, yes, that was our anticipation.

310
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:38,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just wanted to clarify that for everybody.

311
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:39,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

312
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Desmond do you have more for us this evening in terms of presentation or I don't in terms of presentation.

313
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the outstanding issues at the time.

314
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And we submitted a written comments which would indicate that all the other department had comments are agreed to.

315
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that kind of closes out what was open at the last meeting.

316
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And just sort of for the benefit of the board members of the public.

317
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:26,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you or someone on the team just, just briefly because it's now I think a sort of a new item, compared to our last meeting, just touch on the on the hours, and that special so we can feel comfortable making a recommendation to the city council on that matter as well.

318
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:27,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly.

319
00:30:28,706 --> 00:30:44,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So as I indicated, I believe at the last meeting, the procedure at city council had always been that you had to move first for the use of the special permit and the convictual license, and then come back at another time for the extended hours of operation.

320
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,359
[SPEAKER_08]: The normal hours in the city by ordinance are 7 a.m.

321
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:49,880
[SPEAKER_08]: to 11 p.m.

322
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And the applicant would be looking for an extension

323
00:30:55,717 --> 00:31:06,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunday through Thursday of one hour till 12pm and as we had discussed at the last meeting deliveries will occur within that time period after the restaurants closed.

324
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:15,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So that portion the Sunday through Thursday was only related to our request for a waiver of the requirement of a specific loading space.

325
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Friday and Saturday, the extended hours petition.

326
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:47,180
[SPEAKER_08]: seeks to add another hour of operation time so from from 9 a.m to midnight with the midnight to 1 1 a.m being again for loading purposes so that the restaurant would close at midnight and then you would have that hour after that the fact to accept deliveries i think when we spoke at the last meeting adam indicated that you know it's it's it would be very unusual to have delivery seven days a week that is probably more

327
00:31:47,621 --> 00:32:04,388
[SPEAKER_08]: two to three times per week but that would be an available time for them to obtain delivery service so that that's what the motion is and we were invited by the clerk to submit it with our petition and certainly it makes it more economical for the client to do so.

328
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:07,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

329
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:16,513
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's turn that over to city staff any comments from city staff before we open to the public.

330
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:21,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

331
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:26,423
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, let's move to members of the public then.

332
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:37,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Same as our last matter, if you wish to participate, you can provide comments, you can use the raise hand feature, message Amanda in the comments there.

333
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:41,215
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also send an email to ocd.medford-ma.gov.

334
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:47,179
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're here, want to raise your hand, we'd be happy to recognize you to speak.

335
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:52,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just giving people a moment.

336
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,397
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like we've received any emails.

337
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:00,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And nothing in advance of the meeting, Amanda?

338
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in advance of the meeting.

339
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:05,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not seeing any raised hands or comments in the chat.

340
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:11,791
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

341
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:25,809
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well we'll close that and we'll move to board deliberation any members of the board with questions, comments, things to share on the presentation tonight.

342
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we feel about the pedestrian measures traffic mitigation that sort of stuff.

343
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey David.

344
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:49,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just jump in and say that I think this team's done a really nice job addressing all our concerns from last time.

345
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:59,339
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like everything was addressed and I'm excited to make that corner of Medford a little nicer.

346
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,240
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

347
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:02,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

348
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:02,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Klaus.

349
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:20,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump in and just, yes, I'd like to, I'd like to say I appreciate working the around the state project and the city project in that corner and the improvements as someone who walks and bikes through there.

350
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to having having that corner a little less chaotic.

351
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:26,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate the work the team has put in on that front.

352
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:29,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

353
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:30,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

354
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:37,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll jump in.

355
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this looks really nice.

356
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:41,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for taking everything into account.

357
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:49,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just flag for kind of later when we get to site review that kind of still interested in more native and low water plants.

358
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:55,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So just so it's not a surprise, but this looks really great.

359
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:56,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work.

360
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:17,012
[SPEAKER_09]: A question with re raising that point is that is that something that is captured within any of the department comments or maybe that's something that we could have it would have to have as a condition of the board's approval.

361
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a question to me.

362
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:38,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess I was asking Amanda to, or if attorney doesn't want to answer that that's fine too I just was looking for the plan to include items as to native plants that would be included in that.

363
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Eric can point us to the exact page but I was pretty sure that we updated to that extent.

364
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:59,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've just confirmed that the plants are native, so I don't think we made any revisions to that effect, but if there are any very specific comments about specific plant materials, I'm happy to work on that.

365
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:17,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can easily capture this in a, in a condition, basically saying you know applicant to prioritize native plantings in the landscape plan, just to make it tidy.

366
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:19,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

367
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,092
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're suggesting though that it's already in the plan.

368
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean if you're already saying you have a landscape plan and all those are natives that we don't even have to worry about a condition I suppose but we can do a condition if we need to.

369
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was a notation, but I might be mistaken.

370
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I defer to Eric on that.

371
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:49,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe the easiest thing is to do the condition, and then that way you can take a look at it afterwards and figure it out.

372
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:54,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're fine with that.

373
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:55,460
[SPEAKER_10]: The plantings are native.

374
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that we necessarily have that as a note on the plan itself, but I don't think it hurts to have that condition.

375
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:02,505
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

376
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:02,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

377
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, other board members or we begin to consider what conditions might make sense here.

378
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a number of things that we have to vote on.

379
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have a total of four.

380
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:38,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I can try to knock a couple of those out by suggesting that one that we can look at is first would be approval or a recommendation for approval of the special permit as to the extended hours.

381
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:46,099
[SPEAKER_09]: We could take that vote separately if the board is ready to move in that direction.

382
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I would mention that.

383
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:55,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, do we have a second.

384
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:58,505
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll second.

385
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:00,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you class.

386
00:38:02,587 --> 00:38:12,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we'll go to a roll call vote and again this is the board recommending to city council to grant the special permit for the extended hours at the location.

387
00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:16,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, before you do the roll call this is vice chair McPherson.

388
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:27,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I have a clarifying question in order to do that I thought that originally, Attorney Desmond had said that the project had to be complete first are we able to give that condition now.

389
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:37,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was her explanation that that, and Attorney Desmond you give a thumbs up or thumbs down but I'm going to try to restate it make sure I understand it is that.

390
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:49,793
[SPEAKER_09]: going into this and what we talked about at the prior meeting was sort of a separation that the city council wanted to sort of see it as a two step process but you got the clearance from the city clerk that this could be combined into one.

391
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:54,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we can do more efficiently, sort of the way I'm proposing to do it today.

392
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:59,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't adding extra layers for the proponent to go forward.

393
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:00,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I understand.

394
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, absolutely.

395
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn Desmond Am I good.

396
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:04,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you comfortable with that.

397
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks.

398
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:07,800
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

399
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll start, then, on the roll call vote with Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

400
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:14,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

401
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:15,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Clyson dress.

402
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:17,243
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

403
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:18,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy down.

404
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:21,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear call us.

405
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I already government fishermen.

406
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:26,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

407
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that's, and I'm a yes as well.

408
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:32,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of our recommendations down.

409
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:46,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I think another one that we can look at that sort of stands on its own is to recommend approval of a waiver of the off street loading requirements.

410
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:52,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is,

411
00:39:53,725 --> 00:40:02,669
[SPEAKER_09]: requirement is in 6.1 point seven of the ordinance, and the city council could waive that requirement or 6.1 point 10.

412
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:10,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the board is so inclined to vote in that direction.

413
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,414
[SPEAKER_09]: We could consider a motion.

414
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:21,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to recommend waiver of the off street loading requirements.

415
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:24,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I so move.

416
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ari, and a second.

417
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:31,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second that.

418
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:32,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks class.

419
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, roll call vice chair jack for McPherson.

420
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:36,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

421
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:38,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Class Andreessen.

422
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:41,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Christy down.

423
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear Calvis.

424
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I already got my fishermen.

425
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I, and I'm and I as well.

426
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:51,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's, that's two down.

427
00:40:53,878 --> 00:41:02,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I think we have the recommendation to the city council to approve special permit, and also approve the site plan.

428
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think this is where our conditions would would come in.

429
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:22,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we have four conditions we have the traffic mitigation completion of the traffic mitigation measures that are summarized in

430
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:30,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Dunford's May 12th memo to Director Blake.

431
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:43,999
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a condition to use within the landscaping plan native plants.

432
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:51,643
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a condition that the applicant needs to

433
00:41:54,296 --> 00:42:11,978
[SPEAKER_09]: secure approval of the plans from engineering prior to city councils to look deliberation on the matter.

434
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:30,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And we probably have a condition that the applicant will also satisfy the conditions of the other general memos fire department diversity inclusion board of health.

435
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:40,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've covered them all because traffic is covered by the memo engineering has a bit of an asterisk next to it.

436
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:50,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the conditions that I can think of board members or Amanda, am I overlooking something.

437
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:59,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I think those are the ones that we had noted.

438
00:42:59,134 --> 00:42:59,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

439
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:01,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

440
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:05,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Desmond has her hand up.

441
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:18,568
[SPEAKER_08]: With regard to the engineering comments just in terms of language, something that's mutual mutually satisfaction resolution of the outstanding engineering issues.

442
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:27,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so it's clear that we kind of need to come to some kind of resolution we're not even sure what it is it could be very simple.

443
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:28,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

444
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:42,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I think just really for members of the public to understand, I would seem unfair to hold the applicant up because we don't have the full and final feedback from the department.

445
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So, especially where there's another step in the process so if there is an issue that's identified it could be resolved, even discussed if need be at the city council deliberation.

446
00:43:55,395 --> 00:44:18,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so with that amendment to the condition, so that the condition as to the Department of Engineering would be that the applicant and the Department of Engineering reach mutually satisfactory satisfactory resolutions on any issues identified by the Department of Engineering in advance of the deliberation with City Council.

447
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:37,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I don't, I don't know 100% what the right answer is here but I think it's probably in everybody's best interest that the site plan recommendation, and the special permit recommendation both have those conditions.

448
00:44:38,435 --> 00:44:45,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose you could try to draw a finer line but it's probably simpler to attach it to, to both we're recommending the approval of both.

449
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:48,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're making the approval both with these conditions.

450
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:53,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, director.

451
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:55,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sort of a process suggestion.

452
00:44:55,775 --> 00:44:57,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was talking with Amanda that.

453
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:24,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the Zoning Ordinance now requests that we send comments to City Council, but City Council's not used to that, that we include a cover letter that's in clear, simple language that any lay person could understand, and then maybe attach to that anything that's more technical and detailed to sort of keep it so that

454
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:41,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Any, any member of the city council could read the basic recommendation understand the basic recommendation, and then anybody who felt the need to be more to go more in depth in it could then choose to read the attachment to it.

455
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:42,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that, does that make sense.

456
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:55,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I mean it seems like is as a matter of sort of internal municipal matter it would make sense for for teed up that way for the council to understand and, you know,

457
00:45:56,497 --> 00:46:03,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Our experience is that when we use too many words, not everybody processes all of it.

458
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:07,987
[SPEAKER_14]: So we wanted to have something that's simple and clear.

459
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:22,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And so to that end, maybe they're putting that on top of the decision, or if the decision is simple, and then attach the conditions in an attachment so that they all have all of them for the record.

460
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:32,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I just try to make things simple because they're not used to seeing all these technical letters and all these technical legal things.

461
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:43,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally when they get recommendations from department heads on their special permits, their process had resulted in recommendations that were on the order of two to three handwritten sentences each.

462
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,562
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what they're used to.

463
00:46:49,359 --> 00:47:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I guess I just don't, I don't want to suggest that we need to have a board meeting to approve, you know, an internal transmittal that I think would come from your office and if you want me or other members of the board to weigh in on it kind of on the side that's fine.

464
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:13,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it sounds like a good, a good practice and a helpful thing to do, no doubt but the decision of course would be what's attached to it.

465
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:14,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

466
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:19,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And are we on the same page?

467
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:29,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Originally, I had been thinking that we try to make the decision as simple as possible with an attachment of conditions.

468
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:37,255
[SPEAKER_14]: But I realize that you might have concerns from the legal perspective.

469
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:44,699
[SPEAKER_14]: We can discuss it offline.

470
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,120
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

471
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:49,267
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

472
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

473
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:57,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, have you been scratching down the conditions?

474
00:47:57,952 --> 00:48:02,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but I've lost track of all of those.

475
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:10,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we could summarize those for everyone and then we'd be able to consider a board vote.

476
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:11,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure thing.

477
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:13,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me list them out.

478
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:23,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can adjust these, but applicant to complete the traffic mitigation efforts summarized in Pat Dunford's May 12 memo.

479
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:40,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Applicant to work with engineering division to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution for any outstanding issues identified by the engineering division ahead of city council public hearing.

480
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:56,437
[SPEAKER_00]: applicant to prioritize native plantings and planting plan and applicant to satisfy the conditions of the other memos, Board of Health, diversity, inclusion and fire.

481
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:57,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

482
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have, I guess let's do this in two I think technically there are two steps so we have this recommendation for site plan approval with conditions.

483
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on that to recommend make that motion.

484
00:49:20,184 --> 00:49:21,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, second.

485
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second.

486
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:23,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

487
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, excellent.

488
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:25,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

489
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:32,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll do a roll call on that this is the site plan with conditions vice chair Jackie McPherson.

490
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:34,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Clyson Jason.

491
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:36,067
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

492
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:37,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrissy dad.

493
00:49:38,388 --> 00:49:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Peter colors are a government fish.

494
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I, and I'm an eye as well.

495
00:49:46,152 --> 00:50:03,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would like to consider if someone would make a motion to recommend approval of the special permit with conditions, recommending to the city council for approval of the special permit with conditions or emotion for that.

496
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:15,479
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Christie I'll make a motion for what you said.

497
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

498
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a second.

499
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:19,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, excellent.

500
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:21,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And roll call vote.

501
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:22,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

502
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:23,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

503
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:24,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice and Jason.

504
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:27,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Christina.

505
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, your colors.

506
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I already got my fishman.

507
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:34,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I, and I'm an eye as well.

508
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Attorney Desmond.

509
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:38,515
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we do.

510
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks very much, appreciate it.

511
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent, thank you to you and to your team and thank you for being so responsive in the presentation tonight.

512
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, have a good night folks.

513
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:51,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

514
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:58,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, returning now to Boston Ave.

515
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:05,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read the notice on this matter.

516
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:21,338
[SPEAKER_09]: This is relative to an application for site plan review and special permits submitted by Simmons properties LLC to construct a 40,000 square foot addition over an existing parking structure at 200 Boston half.

517
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:26,480
[SPEAKER_09]: The applicant has applied for a special permit, seeking relief for the following.

518
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:44,257
[SPEAKER_09]: project does not comply with dimensional requirements for rear setback, which is required in office to zoning districts, and as to landscape, open space, as proposed, is evidently is deficient, less than the lot area required.

519
00:51:46,327 --> 00:52:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what's before us the Community Development Board is acting as site plan review authority, and also the special permit granting authority for dimensional relief which is a new wrinkle in the ordinance that we have not seen before but we now have the ability to

520
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:08,666
[SPEAKER_09]: issue a special permit for certain dimensional deficiencies, if you will.

521
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:21,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, as you know, used to work at Cummings, and although I have not in quite some time, I did recuse myself from the first round on this project.

522
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:29,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the project is essentially coming back in much the same form here tonight, I'm going to recuse myself from this one.

523
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to turn the baton over to our vice chair.

524
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:38,729
[SPEAKER_09]: who is ready to run this discussion, and I will return afterwards.

525
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,091
[SPEAKER_09]: So with no further ado, Vice Chair McPherson.

526
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:43,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, David.

527
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:44,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

528
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:45,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, everyone.

529
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:47,694
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Jackie Patato, Vice Chair.

530
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:57,738
[SPEAKER_16]: And at this point, since David has already prepared us for what to be going before us, I will ask the proponent, Mr. Mavini, if you can, if you wanted to

531
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:06,833
[SPEAKER_16]: take over and Amanda, if you can please give him the control so that he can share his screen with us and he can do his presentation.

532
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:12,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

533
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:18,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to the Community Development Board and any members of the public who might be here this evening.

534
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:20,636
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Michael Albany.

535
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an architect with Cummings Properties.

536
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:28,537
[SPEAKER_11]: We are representing Simmons Properties LLC on behalf of Cummings Foundation.

537
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:37,640
[SPEAKER_11]: As the chair said, we are here this evening seeking a special permit and site plan review for our proposed expansion at 200 Boston Ave.

538
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:48,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty excited that we get to be the first test case here for, for this group for that tweak in the office to zoning.

539
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:58,216
[SPEAKER_11]: zoning bylaw that allows us zoning ordinance that allows the board to address dimensional deficiencies.

540
00:53:58,396 --> 00:53:58,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Very exciting.

541
00:53:58,976 --> 00:54:01,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give a brief history of the project.

542
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:07,281
[SPEAKER_11]: As some of you may recall, this project was before the board in 2021.

543
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:17,486
[SPEAKER_11]: At the time, the Zoning Board of Appeals was the special permit granting authority for those two deficiencies that we'll get into a little further.

544
00:54:19,062 --> 00:54:29,148
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time, the Community Development Board provided to the ZBA a site plan review recommendation letter recommending the approval of the project.

545
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:32,851
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that letter was dated September 30th, 2021.

546
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:40,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Shortly thereafter, we went to the Zoning Board of Appeals and they denied the application for the special permit.

547
00:54:41,315 --> 00:54:45,158
[SPEAKER_11]: At that point in time, we put the project on the back burner and

548
00:54:47,672 --> 00:54:51,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we are now, we'd like to kind of rekindle this fire if we can.

549
00:54:55,426 --> 00:55:21,365
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that made us want to come back here was after the ZBA denied the special permit application, the city has gone through a zoning recodification that allowed this board to look at those two aspects of the two deficiencies, the provision

550
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:32,480
[SPEAKER_11]: in section 4.2.8.5 allows the Community Development Board to be the special permit granting authority in this case.

551
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:45,212
[SPEAKER_11]: In July of 2022, the Community Development Board voted to recommend to the City Council

552
00:55:48,732 --> 00:56:01,670
[SPEAKER_11]: We came, we came to the Community Development Board so that we can move this property from the industrial district to the zoning district and this board provided a recommendation as such, we went to the city council and they moved it to the zoning district.

553
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So then hey, we're back here with the project right.

554
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:18,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So the challenges that this project faces the two dimensional issues of the rear yard setback, the rear yard setback is required to be 15 feet.

555
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:25,461
[SPEAKER_11]: We currently have 0.3 feet, and this building was built in the

556
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:38,130
[SPEAKER_11]: 1920s as a factory building and there was a railroad spur in the back and there was a railroad side and the train would come right up to the back of the building and open up the sides and everything would be brought in.

557
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So setback is what the setback is, I guess.

558
00:56:42,934 --> 00:56:46,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the landscaped open space requirement is 15%.

559
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,920
[SPEAKER_11]: We are proposing 7%.

560
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,864
[SPEAKER_11]: We are adding landscaping to this property as proposed.

561
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:56,405
[SPEAKER_11]: The current condition is 6.8%.

562
00:56:58,146 --> 00:57:03,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Interestingly enough, the industrial zoning district that we opted out of had zero.

563
00:57:03,209 --> 00:57:04,670
[SPEAKER_11]: The property was developed that way.

564
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,811
[SPEAKER_11]: We were lucky to have some there.

565
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:09,692
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to make that a little better.

566
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:14,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, the site has historically been paved, but for the small amount of open space that's there.

567
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:18,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that, I would like to share my screen if that's okay.

568
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:21,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

569
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:23,840
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, share.

570
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Can everybody see what I get going on here.

571
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:34,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent and you can see my cursor as well, as I move stuff around.

572
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:39,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I talk with my hands a lot and here I'm going to talk with my cursor even more I think so.

573
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:40,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

574
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:47,478
[SPEAKER_11]: So the project before the board this evening is a redevelopment of an existing civil single level parking structure into.

575
00:57:49,468 --> 00:57:55,254
[SPEAKER_11]: multi story approximately 41,000 gross square foot mixed use research and testing space.

576
00:57:56,795 --> 00:58:01,079
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to add roughly 40 structured parking spaces to the property.

577
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:10,988
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes up to about 2000 square feet on the ground level that is intended to be kind of a amenity space neighborhood amenity space.

578
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:17,916
[SPEAKER_11]: similar to the project we saw two ago in front of the board over at the Ball Square area.

579
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:26,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I think before I go too far, I do want to say this project has not changed one iota since 2021.

580
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:29,701
[SPEAKER_11]: This presentation you're going to see is the same.

581
00:58:30,242 --> 00:58:32,263
[SPEAKER_11]: The plans are the same.

582
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:33,543
[SPEAKER_11]: The submission was the same.

583
00:58:33,563 --> 00:58:36,724
[SPEAKER_11]: We were then and we are now.

584
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:48,074
[SPEAKER_11]: very comfortable with all the conditions that the municipal departments made on this approval back in 2021 and are more than happy to accept those.

585
00:58:48,094 --> 00:58:50,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we provided documentation to that as well.

586
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:57,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I think most of the comments that came in were also almost exactly the same or very similar.

587
00:58:57,217 --> 00:59:01,999
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that's helpful, everybody knows that this is very similar to what we talked about in the past.

588
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:11,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So the slide you're looking at is kind of our vision of the property looking south down Boston Ave.

589
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:21,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, the two stories of leaseable space in the foreground, there's a level of parking here, and then there's the ground level of parking that's going to remain.

590
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:27,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So the ground level remains, the parking deck remains, and there are two levels that are going to be built above it.

591
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:31,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the next one.

592
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:40,202
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an illustration of our vision of the property looking north up Boston Ave.

593
00:59:40,602 --> 00:59:45,646
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're seeing in the foreground is the parking structure that we're going to expand.

594
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:52,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the parking deck you drive in here now and you drive around and you come up to about this point right here that you can see here.

595
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping everybody can see my cursor.

596
00:59:54,692 --> 01:00:02,277
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to extend that and just put another level on the piece that's in front to account for some extra covered parking spaces.

597
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:10,138
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a vision of our building again the north elevation inside the site.

598
01:00:10,158 --> 01:00:18,884
[SPEAKER_11]: The, the, the building will be connected to the existing building there a two story elevated pedestrian walkway.

599
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:24,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course our goal is to make that an accessible connection.

600
01:00:25,342 --> 01:00:31,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we we had in the past worked with the fire department on the clearances here and we were pretty good.

601
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:34,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, um, nothing's changed since then.

602
01:00:34,111 --> 01:00:40,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully we'll, uh, also be, um, in good, good condition with the fire department and their access.

603
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so this has kind of different, um,

604
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,718
[SPEAKER_11]: different views of the site.

605
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:52,739
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how the site looks now, if you're looking south down 200 Boston Ave.

606
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,361
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, if you were standing in the middle of Boston Ave, it's kind of looking east.

607
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:58,742
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you see right now.

608
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:00,003
[SPEAKER_11]: The parking deck is in here.

609
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:03,724
[SPEAKER_11]: These are precast concrete panels and there's a steel frame parking deck there.

610
01:01:05,005 --> 01:01:10,147
[SPEAKER_11]: This view right here, view C, I guess, is looking north.

611
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:15,650
[SPEAKER_11]: You drive into the site and here's the, you kind of drive up the ramp and then the ramp goes all the way to here.

612
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,493
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to again from this point here extend the ramp up, add a deck up there.

613
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:26,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if I can zoom in a little more just to make this I don't know I'm having a tough time seeing it.

614
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:29,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you folks are seeing so bear with me.

615
01:01:32,363 --> 01:01:37,567
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an overhead view of kind of a locus plan, Boston Ave, Mystic Valley Parkway, the river.

616
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:43,152
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where the addition will be the building will be built.

617
01:01:44,632 --> 01:01:56,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Similarly, a little more site context, the existing parking structures here, the footprint of the provostry developments in red, the existing buildings here, the bridge will be, elevated pedestrian walkway will be right here.

618
01:01:56,634 --> 01:02:05,636
[SPEAKER_11]: To locate everybody, U-Haul's here, 196 Boston Ave, the Elizabeth Grady property is right here.

619
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:10,257
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of an overhead view.

620
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually like this view a lot.

621
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of an overhead view to see what's going on there now.

622
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:22,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, if anybody has any questions as I go along, please feel free to interrupt me.

623
01:02:22,987 --> 01:02:23,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I could talk all day.

624
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:34,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm going to share with you now is the package that was submitted for the building permit application into the Community Development Board for this particular meeting.

625
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:37,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this just introduces the project team.

626
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:43,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself as the architect Simmons properties, our civil engineer Max Lager our traffic engineer tie and bond.

627
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, existing conditions of the property now, nothing to nothing too crazy commercial building.

628
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:59,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just hold on I'm not quite sure you can see the whole thing, land use table, the existing commercial building the existing parking garage.

629
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, this is the kind of in the green.

630
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:07,582
[SPEAKER_11]: What you'll see here is kind of the footprint of what the new building is going to be.

631
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,582
[SPEAKER_11]: It's and we're not expanding the footprint at all.

632
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:11,803
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll all sit inside that same footprint.

633
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:25,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I've highlighted here the, the, the two, um, deficiencies on the side, if you will, uh, and yellow highlighted is the rear set very odd set back.

634
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:26,947
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just, just one little corner right here.

635
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:27,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

636
01:03:29,332 --> 01:03:31,013
[SPEAKER_11]: that is the challenge.

637
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,393
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets wider as it goes out.

638
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:34,734
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have some parking back here.

639
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:45,659
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had an access agreement in the past with the MBTA to use the area back there, and it also allows the fire department to get the circulation.

640
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, the landscaped open space, as you can see here, we have

641
01:03:53,413 --> 01:04:01,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not giving anybody any vertical or anything but we're required to be 15% of the lot we are now 6.8% or adding a few hundred square feet.

642
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:04,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll show you where that is as we go forward.

643
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:12,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It was part of one of the conditions that we talked about actually it's here we're going to add some space here one of the comments and some of the comment letters in the past for that.

644
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:27,146
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to get the parking a little further back from the street, so we'll add landscaping there to make up, serves two purposes, gives us a little more landscaping and also opens up the safety here for pedestrians and traffic.

645
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And just another interesting slide.

646
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:36,240
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have 1, 2, 3, 4 electrical vehicle charging stations.

647
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,482
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're not there now, they will potentially be there by the end of the month.

648
01:04:40,302 --> 01:04:46,485
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been installing them throughout our portfolio, so there will be some electric charging stations there.

649
01:04:47,525 --> 01:04:57,129
[SPEAKER_11]: If in time they get used and there's a demand for it, we're very much amenable to adding more, but we're going to start with that for now.

650
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:06,340
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a significant amount of bicycle racks throughout the, there's a good amount of bicycle racks in here.

651
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,400
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one, two.

652
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:10,942
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's one, two locations that are outside right now.

653
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:13,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this is under the existing building.

654
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:16,064
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have two covered locations currently.

655
01:05:16,505 --> 01:05:18,566
[SPEAKER_11]: We will continue to have two current locations.

656
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:22,087
[SPEAKER_11]: We will dedicate space in the parking garage for bicycle parking.

657
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:24,889
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is one open rack here at the 196 building.

658
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:29,687
[SPEAKER_11]: just catch up to my notes.

659
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I miss one?

660
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me a second.

661
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,451
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I did not.

662
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:38,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

663
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,232
[SPEAKER_11]: This is some of the utilities.

664
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, none of this has changed.

665
01:05:43,252 --> 01:05:48,554
[SPEAKER_11]: We have anticipated utility consumption, water and sewer.

666
01:05:49,094 --> 01:05:55,997
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the comments that was made, and it was a fair comment, I think by the DPW that we

667
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:04,711
[SPEAKER_11]: This, the building sewer will not tie into the water stand separator I'm going to bring it back out to this manhole.

668
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:14,696
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a mistake on my part in the past and we'll certainly address that and all the other comments but it's a fair one but that's probably the only thing that's different.

669
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:24,675
[SPEAKER_11]: meet with the water department and on site back in 2001.

670
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:33,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this eight inch waterline serves this adjacent building to 222 Boston Ave.

671
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:33,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And

672
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:49,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So the water shoot it serves as the fire water but the domestic water comes off of North North Street or North album not sure which one it's actually called, but we decided that that was in that was there.

673
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,773
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have permission to loop that obviously because it's another property.

674
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:55,195
[SPEAKER_11]: But when talking with the water department.

675
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:56,376
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a.

676
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:09,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that if when this property got redeveloped as they may very well get redeveloped, that was the time that we could potentially loop all that and that could be part of the program.

677
01:07:13,382 --> 01:07:14,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, nothing super exciting.

678
01:07:15,143 --> 01:07:17,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go back sometimes a little quick here.

679
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:19,405
[SPEAKER_11]: here.

680
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:20,506
[SPEAKER_11]: We get just electric.

681
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:23,288
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get all the utilities will come from on site.

682
01:07:24,089 --> 01:07:31,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Um we have worked with we had started some communication with the electric company and have subsequently stopped it.

683
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:34,017
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will get back on that as soon as we have the opportunity.

684
01:07:34,678 --> 01:07:46,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Um um, to do so if this project goes forward to pick up all the electric from from on site, so in general, we don't expect that we're gonna have to go into the street for any of these utilities, and that's a.

685
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:51,630
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be super, super helpful here to us anyway.

686
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,202
[SPEAKER_11]: This plan is the grading and drainage plan.

687
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:09,009
[SPEAKER_11]: So many years ago when we built, there was an addition here, this building kind of stopped here, there was a single story addition in 2011, we knocked it down, and we constructed a four story addition to this building.

688
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,412
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time we looked to see if there was an opportunity to do some recharging, there wasn't.

689
01:08:14,913 --> 01:08:16,454
[SPEAKER_11]: We had dug a big test pit here.

690
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:18,835
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some challenges.

691
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:22,337
[SPEAKER_11]: The water table is a little higher than we would have liked it to have been.

692
01:08:22,377 --> 01:08:27,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just wouldn't have had the system, wouldn't have had the coverage or the opportunity to recharge.

693
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:41,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So the position that we took and since then, and when we're in 2001, 21, two years ago, and we talked about this as it's a redevelopment project, we're going to increase the

694
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:45,602
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, pervious area.

695
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:58,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So it becomes a redevelopment project for the mass T. P. One of the benefits here is when we put a roof on this, um, on this structure, um, at least the water, it won't right now that the parking garage goes to the old water sand separator.

696
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:07,092
[SPEAKER_11]: The water will be theoretically a little, um, I can't call it clean water, but it's definitely cleaner because it doesn't have the sand and the oils in it.

697
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:09,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is some environmental benefits to that as well.

698
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Landscape plan.

699
01:09:13,673 --> 01:09:15,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, let me go back here and landscape plan.

700
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:20,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Not again not much has changed on this, we will.

701
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:23,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We added some more green space over here.

702
01:09:23,267 --> 01:09:26,872
[SPEAKER_11]: We typically do stuff off of our.

703
01:09:28,222 --> 01:09:29,502
[SPEAKER_11]: a typical planting list.

704
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:40,125
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd be happy to consider native plants and low water plants as we redevelop the landscape plant.

705
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:42,946
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna try to save as much of it, but it's a very tight site.

706
01:09:43,006 --> 01:09:48,088
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're probably gonna be looking at thinking about how we replant some of the things there.

707
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:55,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I only included this slide again because it was part of the submission package.

708
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:01,393
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple other things I wanted to highlight.

709
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:04,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's the, it was kind of the grade level plan.

710
01:10:04,214 --> 01:10:05,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to highlight in green.

711
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,575
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all the accessible parking spaces.

712
01:10:08,815 --> 01:10:10,796
[SPEAKER_11]: There are, bear with me.

713
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:12,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just find that.

714
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:19,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there are more spaces than required there.

715
01:10:19,738 --> 01:10:25,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there was supposed to be nine, one, two, three, four, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

716
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:30,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I think based on the number of spaces, it was supposed to be nine.

717
01:10:30,169 --> 01:10:31,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's 13 here.

718
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's 13 here.

719
01:10:32,971 --> 01:10:38,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the comments was that is make as many as possible in the places that were accessible.

720
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:41,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, there's an accessible ramp entrance here.

721
01:10:41,297 --> 01:10:42,999
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an accessible ramp entrance here.

722
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And the covered spaces are all in the core.

723
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:54,768
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's an elevator core here that allows us to have these spaces are as close to this core as possible.

724
01:10:58,356 --> 01:11:09,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, typical upper level plan here, the parking garage, again, as it exists now, will come around to this tan part is what's going to be added between here and here, and then it'll come up to this upper level.

725
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:12,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Another accessible space here.

726
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:19,521
[SPEAKER_11]: There is opportunities to add another accessible space here if the need becomes as such, we will be happy to do that.

727
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:21,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We designed that accordingly.

728
01:11:23,763 --> 01:11:24,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Roof plan.

729
01:11:27,023 --> 01:11:27,983
[SPEAKER_11]: actually, we'll go back down here.

730
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:29,203
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the upper level.

731
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:33,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The garage doesn't go that high, so elevated core here, stairs.

732
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:37,325
[SPEAKER_11]: This will also share the stairs with these set of stairs here, these egress stairs.

733
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:41,146
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be solar panels on here.

734
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:47,947
[SPEAKER_11]: We will do our best to, or better, to comply with the Medford solar ordinance.

735
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:53,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, the intent of this building is for it to be

736
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,383
[SPEAKER_11]: a research and testing facility.

737
01:11:58,044 --> 01:12:05,221
[SPEAKER_11]: As such, we need to, we can certainly, the roof will be prepared and the roof will be able to, it will be solar ready.

738
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:10,016
[SPEAKER_11]: We do anticipate some roof equipment here based on the use.

739
01:12:10,836 --> 01:12:17,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So we kind of looked at the solar on the garage part more and more focused at their 160 panels.

740
01:12:18,322 --> 01:12:26,229
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about annually, it's about 74,000 kilowatt hours annually saved.

741
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:34,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Comes out to about 59 tons per year of CO2 that this saves in electricity.

742
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:46,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, some building sections, I don't know, I don't want to kind of bore you with that, but basically, you know, the existing levels here and then in green and blue are the new levels.

743
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:51,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is kind of a longitudinal section and some shorter sections.

744
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:58,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevations again very similar to what you saw last time.

745
01:12:58,152 --> 01:13:05,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the comments the board made last time was that there were two comments that will remain.

746
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:14,379
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to continue to create some streetscape entrance from Boston Ave so that you know where to enter the building here and we will

747
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:22,264
[SPEAKER_11]: install some kind of screening on the garage so it doesn't look like as much of a parking garage.

748
01:13:22,644 --> 01:13:33,971
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be, whether it's a fabric screening or a metal screening, the goal would be to be able to retain the open parking structure designation.

749
01:13:34,992 --> 01:13:40,776
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are the two things that we talked about a couple of years ago that were a focus of this board and they still remain.

750
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:44,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, a kind of a

751
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:51,837
[SPEAKER_11]: three-dimensional view of what we're looking at in the site.

752
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:53,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, these were just included in the plan.

753
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:55,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that elevation.

754
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:59,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking south, looking north.

755
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:13,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the shadow studies, if anybody has any questions on that, it looks like they're going to be more intrusive into the back of the site than on the houses across the street.

756
01:14:15,837 --> 01:14:23,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to answer any questions, if anybody has any take a break.

757
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:32,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, Mr. I appreciate you going over those very extensively with the full details.

758
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:40,527
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point, what I'll stop in and I'll open it up to the city staff to provide any kind of input that they may have at this at this time.

759
01:14:50,377 --> 01:14:50,858
[SPEAKER_17]: You're on mute.

760
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

761
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Director, thank you very much.

762
01:14:56,746 --> 01:15:02,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Director Hunt or Amanda, if you have anything that you want to add to this before we open it up to our board and to the public.

763
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:14,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I will just add it kind of a high level so the our office reviewed this extensively when it came in originally we thought it was a good project.

764
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:23,394
[SPEAKER_14]: We were happy with the changes that the planning board brought to it at that time, which, to my memory are still incorporated here.

765
01:15:24,075 --> 01:15:31,177
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very frustrating when our ZBA decided that it took issue with the zoning decisions of the

766
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:32,606
[SPEAKER_14]: building commissioner.

767
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:36,612
[SPEAKER_14]: We think this would be excellent for economic development in the area.

768
01:15:37,613 --> 01:15:46,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Cummings is a great organization to have in the city and to be working with us and for them to have more space that they are filling with their mission.

769
01:15:46,526 --> 01:15:47,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I think

770
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:49,255
[SPEAKER_14]: is good for the city.

771
01:15:50,955 --> 01:15:55,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's just very kind of high level I feel like we really did go through a lot of stuff.

772
01:15:56,496 --> 01:16:03,718
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm back then and I'm hopeful that all of those things are still an account here.

773
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:14,800
[SPEAKER_14]: They, I mean to my memory they appear to be I didn't I personally did not go back and cross reference them to the filing two years ago so Amanda's telling me in the background they are that she did that work.

774
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:16,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

775
01:16:17,511 --> 01:16:17,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

776
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,172
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Amanda.

777
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:21,193
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Director Hunt.

778
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,033
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate it.

779
01:16:22,193 --> 01:16:29,157
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I was, I've actually, I quickly cross-referenced myself as Mr. Vinnie was going through everything.

780
01:16:29,177 --> 01:16:45,765
[SPEAKER_16]: And it seems we do have obviously a couple of new comments that came in from the city, but it seems as though the city staff, the department heads don't have much more to add either, but we'll get to that part after I open it up to the rest of the board to see if they have any questions.

781
01:16:48,498 --> 01:16:52,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Does any board members want to speak or provide input.

782
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just have a question quickly.

783
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:04,922
[SPEAKER_13]: We had talked about retail.

784
01:17:06,282 --> 01:17:08,863
[SPEAKER_13]: We previously reviewed this, this project.

785
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,403
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the status of that.

786
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:13,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to talk.

787
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:18,106
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still the amenity space right here still remains about 2000 square feet.

788
01:17:18,526 --> 01:17:25,889
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will tell you, I didn't update these plans I submitted the same package from two years ago so this is really the same package.

789
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:30,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously we haven't marketed this yet, because we don't have any.

790
01:17:32,612 --> 01:17:35,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we're not at the approval, we don't have an approval yet.

791
01:17:36,595 --> 01:17:38,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're committed to it, though.

792
01:17:38,276 --> 01:17:43,438
[SPEAKER_11]: It's there, it's gonna be part of the approved package, hopefully, and we're gonna move forward with it.

793
01:17:46,540 --> 01:18:04,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is just me trying to mine my thoughts from the last time we looked at this, but I feel like there was a request that you looked at, and again, we could have moved away from this, but it's just something that I'm seeing this image and I'm thinking of.

794
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:11,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it seems odd to me that the entrance to a public space wouldn't be on that corner.

795
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:18,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, versus where it is, uh, sort of around the corner.

796
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:28,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and I think we had also talked about, like, potential for outdoor areas, I guess, with those umbrellas or sort of what you're suggesting there.

797
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't know.

798
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:32,992
[SPEAKER_13]: It just seems odd to me that you wouldn't try to activate that

799
01:18:34,808 --> 01:18:42,370
[SPEAKER_13]: that pretty civic gesture that you have with either an entry to the building or an entry to the amenity retail space.

800
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:44,430
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a good point.

801
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,471
[SPEAKER_11]: We did talk about that extensively.

802
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:53,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So the challenge we have is that there's definitely a grade difference here that we're gonna have to deal with.

803
01:18:54,533 --> 01:19:00,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It is possible that we could, and there's some utilities here that we'd have to consider.

804
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:03,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's some, go back here a little bit.

805
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:10,662
[SPEAKER_11]: if you don't mind, I think, if I had a safe plan, I know for a fact.

806
01:19:12,984 --> 01:19:20,451
[SPEAKER_11]: There is some, in this area here, there is some telephone equipment and some electrical stuff.

807
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:26,135
[SPEAKER_11]: We could, at one point in time, we had considered kind of digging this out and put a retaining wall.

808
01:19:26,536 --> 01:19:28,838
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be, I don't know,

809
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:36,174
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we could probably get half of that landscape back and kind of cut that in here if we had to if that made more sense.

810
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:43,280
[SPEAKER_11]: We just felt like this was going to be the kind of the main access a little bit off the street, there could certainly still be signage here.

811
01:19:44,722 --> 01:19:45,803
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something to consider.

812
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:54,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think, I think if you were clever about it, and I think that dashed line is suggesting the limits of the retail space.

813
01:19:56,785 --> 01:20:06,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, if you really sort of activated that window and then I had the entry in a, in a sort of clever way, sort of in here where you want it.

814
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:17,774
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was suggesting leaving it the way you have it, but like the way, the way it's reading right now is that you have this big window that doesn't really, doesn't seem accessible.

815
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:25,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the door sort of down the alley a little bit, but if there was a way to sort of visually connect them or.

816
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:38,120
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of create a transparency or something in that element that's sort of really read as retail and that maybe the entrance became not as important.

817
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:53,128
[SPEAKER_13]: There's that bottom brow, which seems to like sort of disconnect the glass corner from access, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

818
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:53,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I get it.

819
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:00,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we could also kind of yeah, we could bring it up.

820
01:21:00,543 --> 01:21:02,744
[SPEAKER_11]: We can move it up to and kind of revisit that.

821
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:03,365
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fair.

822
01:21:04,145 --> 01:21:05,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'd be worth studying for sure.

823
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:06,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, I agree.

824
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:18,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any other questions or comments from board before we open it up for the public?

825
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:32,335
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, hearing none, I am actually going to go ahead and open up to the public.

826
01:21:33,015 --> 01:21:38,498
[SPEAKER_16]: And so those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

827
01:21:38,858 --> 01:21:43,401
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

828
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:47,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

829
01:21:47,623 --> 01:21:51,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Remind all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function.

830
01:21:51,665 --> 01:21:54,507
[SPEAKER_16]: to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

831
01:21:54,927 --> 01:21:59,751
[SPEAKER_16]: If a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat.

832
01:22:00,431 --> 01:22:02,532
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to share and all the staff.

833
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:06,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, I can't see the entire screen.

834
01:22:06,315 --> 01:22:13,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can help me see if there's... Yeah, and actually, Mike, would you mind stopping the share screen for a moment?

835
01:22:17,509 --> 01:22:17,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

836
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:25,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just checked our email, and I'm not seeing any new comments come in, and we did not receive any ahead of the meeting.

837
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:35,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm taking a look here at the participants list, and I don't see any raised hands or comments in the chat at this time.

838
01:22:38,692 --> 01:22:39,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

839
01:22:40,813 --> 01:22:49,319
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time, Amanda, I'm gonna, so I will close the public comments since you don't have, since we don't have any that are coming in right now.

840
01:22:49,819 --> 01:23:00,747
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the things I wanted to just make sure is that before I proceed to the board to get us to deliberate, I want to make sure that we are in compliance with making sure that we're considering the special permit as the grant and authority.

841
01:23:01,988 --> 01:23:17,581
[SPEAKER_16]: We've already looked at if there's a special, if you can guide me on if there's a special consideration besides what the department has already entered into, or have already provided to the proponent to be considered, whether it's for traffic or anything like that.

842
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:25,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, then the board would deliberate without, the board would deliberate outside of whatever you suggest.

843
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:32,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if I may, Jackie.

844
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

845
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:38,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe what I'll do is I'll post in the chat just for board members to refer to.

846
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:48,332
[SPEAKER_00]: There is special permit criteria that I think might be important for board members to touch on as everyone deliberates.

847
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:55,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me paste that in the chat, and folks, let me know if you can't see it.

848
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone, let's put it right here.

849
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:22,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the Special Permit Granting Authority, which in this case is the board, must provide kind of a determination on whether there are adverse effects that this project has, or rather that they will not outweigh its beneficial impacts to the city.

850
01:24:23,218 --> 01:24:28,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And the criteria are the ones, the six ones listed in the chat there.

851
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:35,538
[SPEAKER_16]: And for public purposes, do you want me to read those out?

852
01:24:38,062 --> 01:24:38,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

853
01:24:38,422 --> 01:24:40,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, actually, it could be good just to... Okay.

854
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:51,045
[SPEAKER_16]: As per 94-11.62 for a special permit criteria, what we are now determining is the consideration of the following.

855
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:55,868
[SPEAKER_16]: One, that social, economic, or community needs which are served by the proposal.

856
01:24:56,028 --> 01:24:59,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading.

857
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Three, adequacy of utilities and other public services.

858
01:25:03,152 --> 01:25:08,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Four, compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.

859
01:25:08,778 --> 01:25:10,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Five, impacts on the natural environment.

860
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:21,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And six, the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan, which we have heard from the city's director, Hunt, that it goes well with the community's needs there.

861
01:25:41,985 --> 01:25:57,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Based on an update from the traffic information from Todd Blake, his overall sentiment in regards to traffic, there's this one tiny mitigation that the proponent can consider and that's just additional blue bikes.

862
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:06,175
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to bring attention to the fact that two of our conditions previously from the previous board ruling, number one and two may be outdated.

863
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:09,716
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's something to look at going forward.

864
01:26:25,073 --> 01:26:31,595
[SPEAKER_16]: And overall, his assessment of the project hasn't changed, then his recommendations have not changed.

865
01:26:33,515 --> 01:26:35,516
[SPEAKER_16]: That's in regards to traffic.

866
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:40,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I make one comment on the traffic?

867
01:26:40,878 --> 01:26:41,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, of course.

868
01:26:42,358 --> 01:26:51,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the traffic mitigation, the traffic mitigation that was proposed, we actually already did.

869
01:26:52,674 --> 01:27:00,258
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked with the DCR to change some of the signal timing at the intersection of Boston Avenue, Mystic Valley Parkway.

870
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:08,223
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was able to confirm that with Mark Parente of the DCR as recently as February, that that work had been done.

871
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:15,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So we provided our traffic engineer and they worked with the DCR to make some signal timing changes.

872
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:18,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And regarding the blue bikes, I think,

873
01:27:21,456 --> 01:27:33,683
[SPEAKER_11]: the city traffic engineer suggested that that could be an alternative to the physical modifications that were proposed to happen in Boston Ave and we'll continue to look at that.

874
01:27:33,703 --> 01:27:36,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually reached out to Blue Bikes and haven't heard back from them.

875
01:27:36,665 --> 01:27:40,488
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a pretty interesting little process, but we'd be

876
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:49,037
[SPEAKER_11]: We will certainly consider that, but we're very comfortable with the mitigation measures that were proposed the first time.

877
01:27:49,537 --> 01:27:59,682
[SPEAKER_11]: The physical improvements, the bike showers and the bike lane, and some of the signage, I think they could be very beneficial.

878
01:28:00,953 --> 01:28:08,715
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in addition, one of the newest is from the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion that was not included previously.

879
01:28:09,135 --> 01:28:14,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you looked at those requirements, those recommendations for ADA compliance?

880
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:26,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, so the building will be accessible and that's where I think they had asked for a few extra or the opportunity to have some extra accessibility spaces if they were necessary.

881
01:28:26,418 --> 01:28:28,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, totally fine with that as well.

882
01:28:28,799 --> 01:28:29,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you can't,

883
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:37,004
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't build the building otherwise, really, so I think we're very amenable to that.

884
01:28:40,627 --> 01:29:01,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Without my influence, I want to say that based on what I've seen and what has been prepared here in the length of our conditions previously, if we looked at our conditions, I think it pretty much covers one through six, but I would need, I don't stand alone, and I would need the board to pretty much weigh in on what you think.

885
01:29:07,829 --> 01:29:09,290
[SPEAKER_16]: This is our first one, so.

886
01:29:14,165 --> 01:29:15,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad I could be here for it.

887
01:29:20,927 --> 01:29:34,431
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess before we actually vote on it, Amanda, are we, the onus is on us to make sure that we have all these conditions again, because we can't just rely on the previous conditions because a couple of them are outdated, right?

888
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:37,832
[SPEAKER_16]: So would we need to relist those 16 conditions?

889
01:29:38,432 --> 01:29:39,973
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it was 16 conditions.

890
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:43,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe an easier way could be

891
01:29:44,815 --> 01:29:58,083
[SPEAKER_00]: If the board was happy with the majority of the conditions, we could refer to compliance with the recommendations from XYZ date, omitting whichever ones may feel outdated.

892
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:04,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it be condition number one or something like that.

893
01:30:04,827 --> 01:30:13,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a subsequent condition, if there were other things that you all discussed that you're interested in seeing, then we can add that as well.

894
01:30:19,129 --> 01:30:23,830
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess this is more of a two-part kind of thing, because we're also doing site plan review.

895
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:29,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So should we do that separately, or should we review the actual standards for approval for that going forward?

896
01:30:32,613 --> 01:30:43,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle, do you have an opinion on whether discussion should be explicitly talking about the special permit, vote on that, and then explicitly talking about site plan review, vote on that?

897
01:30:43,496 --> 01:30:47,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it makes sense to deliberate on both first?

898
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:52,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, some of them go hand in hand, but I mean, it should be two separate votes.

899
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:53,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

900
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the same same decision.

901
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that you need to.

902
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:59,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this is a new filing.

903
01:31:00,253 --> 01:31:07,078
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have to make sure you can't necessarily rely on the old approval that didn't go anywhere.

904
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:15,324
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, you should just you should go through the the different criteria.

905
01:31:16,522 --> 01:31:17,904
[SPEAKER_15]: in order and then make a vote.

906
01:31:18,664 --> 01:31:37,281
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of them well there's some overlap so you could, you know, reference like, you know, as we discussed for, you know, Criterion two of site plan, or have special permit, you know, we make the same findings for, you know, x criterion in site plan review or something like that, just

907
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:46,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, determining that we're hitting on every, um, one of the, uh, the listed points.

908
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:51,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you need to, you do mean you make all the findings.

909
01:31:54,825 --> 01:32:03,250
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically what I'm asking the board is, do we find that one social economic community needs, which are served by the proposal and the

910
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, do we find that the traffic flow and safety include in parking and loading?

911
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:13,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Three, do we find adequacy of utilities and other public services?

912
01:32:13,882 --> 01:32:18,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Four, compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood?

913
01:32:19,405 --> 01:32:21,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Five, do we find impacts on the natural environment?

914
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:30,509
[SPEAKER_16]: And six, do we find the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan before we make recommendations?

915
01:32:31,909 --> 01:32:33,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Is what I am asking the board.

916
01:32:43,185 --> 01:33:02,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure from a process perspective, obviously being fairly new at this, but I think, I mean, in my view, these are definitely hit, especially in my opinion, in comparison to the previous uses of it as just a parking garage.

917
01:33:02,678 --> 01:33:07,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we've got it.

918
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:09,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Peter.

919
01:33:09,945 --> 01:33:19,228
[SPEAKER_16]: To me, the social economic community needs definitely served, obviously, because as Peter has pointed out, before it was just the parking garage that was serving cars.

920
01:33:19,368 --> 01:33:24,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's going to be serving people, communities, economic benefit for the community.

921
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:27,510
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I cannot stand alone on that.

922
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:34,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading, has been determined by Todd Blake.

923
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:36,452
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm going on the expert of the department head.

924
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:40,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Three, adequacy of utilities and public utilities.

925
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:45,416
[SPEAKER_16]: I am going by, again, the determination of the department heads.

926
01:33:46,297 --> 01:33:50,159
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.

927
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,281
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as scale, that's something that we can further discuss if we

928
01:33:56,842 --> 01:34:02,726
[SPEAKER_16]: We had board member Clay's agency has already Asked a few questions.

929
01:34:02,806 --> 01:34:04,106
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't have any myself.

930
01:34:04,126 --> 01:34:17,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know if any of the other board members wanted to do a great on that particular point As far as impacts on a natural environment Direct director hunt.

931
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:24,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you have a specific thing for climate or resiliency there for us to do a rate on that point.

932
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:24,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I

933
01:34:30,054 --> 01:34:33,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't really have anything particular to add.

934
01:34:33,736 --> 01:34:35,176
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a lot of green space.

935
01:34:35,216 --> 01:34:37,437
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a lot of space to put green space.

936
01:34:37,477 --> 01:34:42,160
[SPEAKER_14]: They do do their best to incorporate native plantings and trees into this.

937
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:54,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'd be hard, particularly given that this is an existing footprint, we're particularly hard pressed to find any additional way to add additional things here.

938
01:34:55,686 --> 01:34:55,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

939
01:34:56,942 --> 01:35:00,667
[SPEAKER_14]: It certainly is not worse on the environment than the existing.

940
01:35:01,408 --> 01:35:09,961
[SPEAKER_14]: And these don't actually say the renewable energy, we appreciate the real effort to get the solar panels on there.

941
01:35:19,325 --> 01:35:21,887
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can probably clean up the conditions.

942
01:35:21,987 --> 01:35:30,712
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, how does the board feel about the existing conditions with eliminate and one and two, um, as being obsolete, um, as per Todd Blake.

943
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:45,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And then if we wanted to add any Peter, um, I know I'm, I'm.

944
01:35:45,855 --> 01:35:46,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good at that.

945
01:35:46,695 --> 01:35:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're asking for a motion or just the general sense of the board, but I think that makes sense.

946
01:35:52,297 --> 01:35:53,937
[SPEAKER_16]: General sense before we do a motion.

947
01:35:53,977 --> 01:35:56,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to get the conditions under control.

948
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:58,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so that's Amanda.

949
01:36:00,019 --> 01:36:00,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

950
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:07,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so Amanda, that would be striking one and two from the, uh, previous conditions.

951
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:09,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

952
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:11,042
[SPEAKER_16]: And then adding, um,

953
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:16,816
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we feel about adding the blue bike reference from public?

954
01:36:22,063 --> 01:36:25,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And the one thing is in number 15, I guess we would just update.

955
01:36:27,822 --> 01:36:40,409
[SPEAKER_16]: to perform a compliance with recommendations and we would update all of the letters at this point because there are up to include updated letters as well as the brand new office of diversity.

956
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:42,691
[SPEAKER_16]: That was originally included.

957
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:47,893
[SPEAKER_16]: So based on those conditions, if we can have a motion to

958
01:36:48,854 --> 01:36:52,478
[SPEAKER_16]: grants a special permit to, uh, for the approval.

959
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:57,885
[SPEAKER_16]: What conditions as do we have, would we have to state them again, Amanda?

960
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:00,291
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.

961
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:01,452
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did have a question.

962
01:37:01,472 --> 01:37:02,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

963
01:37:02,793 --> 01:37:11,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Les had brought up this idea of kind of exploring sort of activation of that glass corner for the retail space.

964
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:20,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe, would the board be interested in, you know, a potential condition to that the applicant revisit?

965
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:25,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like ways to activate that corner.

966
01:37:27,042 --> 01:37:34,305
[SPEAKER_00]: with specifically with regard to how the wind I guess the windows, the glasses used and the entrance to the amenity.

967
01:37:35,086 --> 01:37:35,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

968
01:37:39,128 --> 01:37:44,290
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize I mentioned that and we would do the list but neglected to add it as a condition.

969
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:45,791
[SPEAKER_16]: All good.

970
01:38:03,695 --> 01:38:05,336
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that, we'll be updated.

971
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:17,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing no other conditions from the board or no other input, do we have a motion to grant a special permit to 200 Boston Ave for approval with conditions as stated?

972
01:38:18,687 --> 01:38:19,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

973
01:38:19,087 --> 01:38:21,469
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Christy, I second.

974
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,651
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, I'm going to do a roll call.

975
01:38:24,891 --> 01:38:26,513
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start with Claes.

976
01:38:30,015 --> 01:38:30,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

977
01:38:31,316 --> 01:38:31,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Christy?

978
01:38:32,517 --> 01:38:32,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

979
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:34,380
[SPEAKER_16]: And I apologize.

980
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,140
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying the names.

981
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:35,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Clay's agency.

982
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:42,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and Christie Dowd, Peter cows, Ari Gold, Goldman Fishman.

983
01:38:46,007 --> 01:38:46,467
[SPEAKER_16]: You're on.

984
01:38:46,647 --> 01:38:48,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw you say, I saw you mouthing it.

985
01:38:49,449 --> 01:38:49,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

986
01:38:49,969 --> 01:38:50,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

987
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:54,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I, and myself, I am a yes as well.

988
01:39:01,343 --> 01:39:06,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Amanda, I don't know if you want to put the SPR standards for approval.

989
01:39:06,648 --> 01:39:10,792
[SPEAKER_16]: I can read them out for the public purpose and the board can go through them.

990
01:39:13,577 --> 01:39:33,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So for one, the provisions of vehicular loading and unloading, what we are looking at now for the actual site plan review, as we all know, we're looking at the provisions for vehicular loading and unloading and parking and for vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the site and into adjacent public streets and ways.

991
01:39:34,286 --> 01:39:39,188
[SPEAKER_16]: It will not create hazards to safety or impose a significant burden upon public facilities.

992
01:39:40,335 --> 01:39:57,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, the bulk location or height of proposed buildings and structures and paved areas and the proposed uses thereof will not be detrimental to other private development in the neighborhood and will not impose undue burdens on the sewers, sanitary and storm drains, water distribution system or similar public facilities.

993
01:39:58,499 --> 01:40:00,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm going to pause for really quickly.

994
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:03,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, we've done site plan review and I think we all know this.

995
01:40:04,003 --> 01:40:07,246
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just rereading this because of our previous activity.

996
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:12,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I continue to read this or since the board is well aware of this process?

997
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:15,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, yeah, and some of these are so lengthy.

998
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:19,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's hard to absorb them when they're read out anyway.

999
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:27,539
[SPEAKER_00]: You all are fairly so familiar with site plan review, and we have it in the chat, the actual language from the ordinance.

1000
01:40:28,499 --> 01:40:38,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone wants, I'm happy to put it on the screen as we're talking through if people find that helpful, or if you'd rather see each other's faces, that's fine too.

1001
01:40:39,945 --> 01:40:40,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1002
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:59,838
[SPEAKER_16]: The one difference that I see with this is a question I was in, I'm not sure if it was covered earlier and how you were going to handle the trash removal.

1003
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:03,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's to Mr. Avini.

1004
01:41:04,941 --> 01:41:16,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so we will have provisions, there are provisions on site now for trash removal there as dumpsters and compactors, and there will be another one added on the first floor.

1005
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:21,313
[SPEAKER_11]: of in the garage or right outside the garage, probably in the garage.

1006
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:25,594
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna have to figure out a way to get it out, but that will happen within the building as well.

1007
01:41:26,334 --> 01:41:28,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Screened from everybody else, no one will see any of it.

1008
01:41:28,554 --> 01:41:29,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1009
01:41:31,515 --> 01:41:40,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And we discussed exterior lighting earlier with one of the provisions that Police Anderson has already laid out.

1010
01:41:40,997 --> 01:41:44,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Does any board members have anything else that they want to add as far as

1011
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:47,701
[SPEAKER_16]: the site plan overall.

1012
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:12,642
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost like a repeat of everything that we've already gone over, and especially with all of the conditions that we've already had before.

1013
01:42:12,682 --> 01:42:17,545
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend the site plan for approval for 200 Boston now.

1014
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:25,831
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so move.

1015
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:29,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1016
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:31,814
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll do a roll call.

1017
01:42:37,297 --> 01:42:37,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1018
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:38,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1019
01:42:38,917 --> 01:42:39,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1020
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:39,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1021
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:40,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1022
01:42:40,378 --> 01:42:42,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1023
01:42:42,358 --> 01:42:42,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1024
01:42:42,558 --> 01:42:42,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1025
01:42:43,939 --> 01:42:44,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1026
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:45,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1027
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:45,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1028
01:42:58,355 --> 01:42:58,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1029
01:42:58,895 --> 01:43:00,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much to everybody.

1030
01:43:00,336 --> 01:43:07,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask one more question that I didn't want to be presumptuous and bring up before but I'd like to discuss it a little bit now.

1031
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:16,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass General Law chapter 48 section nine is about regard special permits, and it allows the special permits to be valid for three years.

1032
01:43:18,869 --> 01:43:22,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And it leaves it to the cities and towns to make those determinations.

1033
01:43:23,053 --> 01:43:30,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I only asked this because I don't know how long, some, some of them are two years every every everybody kind of looks at it a little differently.

1034
01:43:32,612 --> 01:43:34,253
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't a this year project for us.

1035
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:38,075
[SPEAKER_11]: We're really looking at thinking about this next year at this point in time.

1036
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:46,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We would like to be able to have this permit be for three years, if that's something that this board is amenable to.

1037
01:43:46,459 --> 01:43:51,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's chapter 40A, section nine is a very specific section about it.

1038
01:43:52,042 --> 01:43:54,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And it puts the power in the city's and town's hands.

1039
01:43:54,923 --> 01:43:59,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So two years might be tight, three years we should be good.

1040
01:44:01,529 --> 01:44:09,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, Director Hunt, do you have any input on, is there something in the ordinance that says how long a special permit is valid for?

1041
01:44:13,196 --> 01:44:20,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm taking a quick look at the, honestly, it's the first time I've been asked this one, to see whether this is something we have to adopt.

1042
01:44:27,902 --> 01:44:44,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I wrong in remembering this really someone having come like an applicant having come back to the board for an extension of a bad that's actually I thought are the site plan reviews were good for one year and then they had to come back and get it renewed and that was because

1043
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:48,108
[SPEAKER_14]: that what comes to mind is the BJ's case.

1044
01:44:48,188 --> 01:44:51,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And they basically said, we went to litigation, we need an extra year.

1045
01:44:51,508 --> 01:44:58,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we actually extended it for one year from the point that the litigation ended.

1046
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:08,292
[SPEAKER_14]: I will tell you, I'm sorry, this is like three pages long.

1047
01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I can digest this on the fly.

1048
01:45:12,553 --> 01:45:14,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I was hoping it was one of those two paragraph ones.

1049
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:21,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I don't know if Danielle has experience from her other communities on this.

1050
01:45:22,587 --> 01:45:30,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this a new provision to grant a special permit for three years.

1051
01:45:32,746 --> 01:45:35,348
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been over a year since I sat on a landing.

1052
01:45:35,628 --> 01:45:52,761
[SPEAKER_14]: There are several notations in this MGL that says fourth paragraph effective until July 2021 and this one is amended in 2021 and so it sounds like this is one of the things that there was actually a lot of things played with during the pandemic.

1053
01:45:55,843 --> 01:45:57,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I can read it to you if you want.

1054
01:45:57,564 --> 01:46:00,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, it's pretty close to the end it's probably.

1055
01:46:03,063 --> 01:46:04,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll read, I'll read you where I got this anyway.

1056
01:46:05,544 --> 01:46:24,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, any ordinance or bylaws shall be provided that such a special permit granted under the section shall lapse within a specified period of time not more than two years, which will not include such time required to pursue or await the determination of an appeal referred to in section 17 from the grant thereof.

1057
01:46:25,105 --> 01:46:35,991
[SPEAKER_11]: If a substantial use thereof has not sooner commenced except for good cause, or in the case of a permit for construction, the construction has not begun by such a date except for good cause.

1058
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:44,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I actually asked this I started asking this question to the building commissioner, the current building commissioner.

1059
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:49,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Forte, and he wasn't quite sure either.

1060
01:46:49,785 --> 01:46:54,868
[SPEAKER_11]: It's silent in your zoning ordinance, what this is, what the timeframe is.

1061
01:46:55,869 --> 01:46:56,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why I wanted to ask.

1062
01:46:56,930 --> 01:47:11,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm happy to go along with however long it's supposed to last for, but I know this isn't a this year project for me, so we're a year from starting it anyway, just to save the aggravation of coming back here if it was,

1063
01:47:14,407 --> 01:47:15,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that that's a problem for me.

1064
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:18,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want to put it on you folks to have to do.

1065
01:47:19,248 --> 01:47:24,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked it, but I'm not, I just want some clarification, I guess that's all.

1066
01:47:24,509 --> 01:47:34,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And not to put anybody in the hot seat if it's something that wants to be thought about at some other time, or, you know, I could come back in some other time or we could just, you could write it however you want to write it.

1067
01:47:35,211 --> 01:47:36,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to kind of talk about it.

1068
01:47:37,191 --> 01:47:38,732
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's not a decision we could make.

1069
01:47:41,536 --> 01:47:47,093
[SPEAKER_15]: This this board can't make that decision that that's it has to be codified zoning ordinance so that would be.

1070
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:52,270
[SPEAKER_15]: a zoning amendment if our ordinance doesn't say last for three years.

1071
01:47:52,290 --> 01:48:15,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's actually in section 94 11.6 point eight is the title lapse under special permits, and that in our says special permits shall lapse if the substantial use thereof or construction there under has not begun except for good cause within 24 months following the filing of the special permit.

1072
01:48:18,663 --> 01:48:23,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is, this does, our ordinance does say 24 months.

1073
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:36,266
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess what I would tell you is that, that if you felt that you could come back and justify it with good cause, you know, we could, we could,

1074
01:48:39,564 --> 01:48:42,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's fair.

1075
01:48:42,406 --> 01:48:51,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So does that the site planner, did they go hand in hand with the site plan review as well then so this is talking about specifically about special permit is a site plan review kind of attached to that as well.

1076
01:48:52,974 --> 01:49:03,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, in our experience so it's it's unusual because of the way, so we actually have a section in special insight plan review for laps as well, which is the same 24 months.

1077
01:49:05,765 --> 01:49:18,535
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I was actually going to say without even finding that that the usually the special permit, the site plan review is in findings are incorporated by the special permit granting authority.

1078
01:49:19,015 --> 01:49:21,778
[SPEAKER_14]: It just happens that this is the same board this time.

1079
01:49:23,019 --> 01:49:27,542
[SPEAKER_14]: But actually that is also there's a statement, so that's a 11 714 11 714 Okay, the other one was 9468.

1080
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:34,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

1081
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:35,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I had it up.

1082
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,581
[SPEAKER_14]: 94-1168.

1083
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:37,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1084
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:38,321
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1085
01:49:40,701 --> 01:49:41,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1086
01:49:41,282 --> 01:49:43,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't take anybody's more time.

1087
01:49:43,342 --> 01:49:46,743
[SPEAKER_11]: 24 months works for me if I have to come back and have another conversation.

1088
01:49:46,763 --> 01:49:47,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic.

1089
01:49:47,523 --> 01:49:48,783
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been 24 months anyway.

1090
01:49:48,823 --> 01:49:49,943
[SPEAKER_11]: We did this 24 months ago.

1091
01:49:51,023 --> 01:49:51,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to come back again.

1092
01:49:52,664 --> 01:49:55,444
[SPEAKER_14]: We would love it if you were under construction in 24 months.

1093
01:49:55,524 --> 01:49:57,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to see this.

1094
01:49:57,405 --> 01:49:59,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a fair timeframe.

1095
01:50:01,246 --> 01:50:02,746
[SPEAKER_11]: It just definitely is not this year.

1096
01:50:03,961 --> 01:50:11,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have the architecture staff to even get this going right now so we're, we're starting fresh here so we're gonna, we'll make it happen.

1097
01:50:11,626 --> 01:50:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate everybody's time.

1098
01:50:13,227 --> 01:50:14,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much to the board.

1099
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:25,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and to the community development, the planning staff we appreciate everybody's help through our impatience and understanding throughout this process and thank you so much.

1100
01:50:25,836 --> 01:50:26,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great night.

1101
01:50:27,017 --> 01:50:27,437
[SPEAKER_16]: You too.

1102
01:50:27,497 --> 01:50:27,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1103
01:50:27,877 --> 01:50:28,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1104
01:50:33,175 --> 01:50:33,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, excellent.

1105
01:50:33,775 --> 01:50:39,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you to our able vice chair, filling in there and getting us through that matter.

1106
01:50:39,438 --> 01:50:40,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that.

1107
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:46,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just but I feel that saying places last name, and properly, I'm sorry.

1108
01:50:47,222 --> 01:50:52,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Andreessen Andreessen I know how to say your last name.

1109
01:50:52,924 --> 01:50:59,928
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I have a long blooper real myself so you're not the first, and you won't be the last.

1110
01:51:01,889 --> 01:51:02,469
[SPEAKER_13]: My whole life.

1111
01:51:05,832 --> 01:51:21,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, next item on the agenda, I think really is to, to just hear a motion and vote on to not consider the April 26 meeting minutes as they're not yet prepared so we have a motion we can move that whole item along.

1112
01:51:24,357 --> 01:51:25,898
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give a motion to move it along.

1113
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:29,247
[SPEAKER_16]: I second.

1114
01:51:31,489 --> 01:51:32,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent, thank you.

1115
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:41,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that's to, to move that item to our next meeting agenda and roll call vote starting with Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

1116
01:51:41,799 --> 01:51:43,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's okay.

1117
01:51:52,698 --> 01:51:53,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie your vote.

1118
01:51:53,699 --> 01:51:53,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1119
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:58,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm sorry.

1120
01:51:59,281 --> 01:51:59,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1121
01:52:00,122 --> 01:52:00,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1122
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:01,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1123
01:52:02,403 --> 01:52:03,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1124
01:52:03,863 --> 01:52:04,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1125
01:52:05,124 --> 01:52:07,365
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm yes as well on the minutes.

1126
01:52:08,826 --> 01:52:13,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, do we have some miscellaneous updates that's where we are on the agenda.

1127
01:52:13,828 --> 01:52:14,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1128
01:52:17,289 --> 01:52:23,815
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you may know, there are a couple of members that have their terms coming up.

1129
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:25,337
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we're kicking them out.

1130
01:52:25,357 --> 01:52:33,144
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, you all have been wonderful, but there are, you know, as part of the regulations and the ordinance, there are limits.

1131
01:52:33,284 --> 01:52:40,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll be seeing, saying goodbye to Christy, David and Kless at the end of June.

1132
01:52:42,192 --> 01:52:52,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're reaching out now to some candidates to potentially fill those spots, as well as we have two open associate member positions.

1133
01:52:52,898 --> 01:53:09,507
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just sort of wanted to plant the seed that with the shifting of folks onto different things and taking in some new members, and David will be part of the group that's leaving, we'll need to consider having someone step into the chair role

1134
01:53:10,748 --> 01:53:14,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I just, I wanted people to start thinking about that.

1135
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:28,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, if anyone has questions for myself or other staff on, you know, what chair sort of entails and I'm sure don't want to offer up David's time, but I feel likely to answer questions on that as well.

1136
01:53:28,856 --> 01:53:32,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that experience is like, um, we're happy to discuss.

1137
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:37,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to put that out there and kind of in a related vein, um,

1138
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,200
[SPEAKER_00]: there.

1139
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:51,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is required that the Community Preservation Committee have a CD board representative as part of its membership.

1140
01:53:52,183 --> 01:53:55,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And Christy has been serving that role for us.

1141
01:53:56,403 --> 01:53:57,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Christy.

1142
01:53:57,784 --> 01:54:03,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ari has offered to step in kind of on an interim basis.

1143
01:54:05,545 --> 01:54:12,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want to re-approach it once we have new members come in at the end of June, early July.

1144
01:54:12,648 --> 01:54:18,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of bring that back to everybody to kind of think about.

1145
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:20,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So just planting that here again.

1146
01:54:22,051 --> 01:54:26,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's all I have, unless Alicia and Danielle have other items.

1147
01:54:28,267 --> 01:54:40,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanna clarify that we have every intention of getting new members appointed in that timeframe so that by the end of June, for the beginning of July, there'd be new people.

1148
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:49,498
[SPEAKER_14]: In the event that we're not able to fill all the positions right away, we've had to verify this for other boards in the past.

1149
01:54:50,459 --> 01:54:54,561
[SPEAKER_14]: There's what you call holdover status that you remain in your appointment until

1150
01:54:55,141 --> 01:54:57,182
[SPEAKER_14]: we appoint somebody else to take your place.

1151
01:54:58,103 --> 01:55:07,489
[SPEAKER_14]: So just because there is a term limit, if we're actively working to fill it, we're hopeful that people won't just say, see ya, if we're having trouble filling them.

1152
01:55:08,389 --> 01:55:10,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we're anticipating that.

1153
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:14,273
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted people to be aware that that can happen.

1154
01:55:15,233 --> 01:55:16,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Christy.

1155
01:55:16,174 --> 01:55:17,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy's like, I'm out.

1156
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:19,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I want to.

1157
01:55:20,737 --> 01:55:21,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably

1158
01:55:23,153 --> 01:55:34,261
[SPEAKER_06]: stay on for like another month, but I won't be able to go past July because I have another commitment on another board that I'm going to have to shift to.

1159
01:55:34,281 --> 01:55:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1160
01:55:36,062 --> 01:55:39,344
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's very helpful to understand because we are trying to fill them.

1161
01:55:39,864 --> 01:55:51,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Historically, we've had a lot of trouble getting the positions filled in a timely manner, but that's just had a lot to do with capacity and the time to get this all figured out and then get the mayor's attention on it.

1162
01:55:52,033 --> 01:56:00,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that she understands that it's a priority and that the getting the appointment letters out are a priority for her staff.

1163
01:56:01,276 --> 01:56:14,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think there's not always an understanding that like their terms and and we need to move this this this through because they don't attend these meetings regularly.

1164
01:56:14,619 --> 01:56:16,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah.

1165
01:56:18,476 --> 01:56:21,217
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do have a list of people that we're looking through.

1166
01:56:21,237 --> 01:56:25,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda's been working on this, reaching out to some people.

1167
01:56:25,899 --> 01:56:39,484
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's anybody that you feel would be a really good fit for this, especially if you think they haven't applied, please push, tell them too, because we do really want, it's wonderful to get people who are enthusiastic.

1168
01:56:39,924 --> 01:56:47,067
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also super helpful to have architects and lawyers and people who work for development companies

1169
01:56:47,447 --> 01:56:54,390
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to have these landscape architects, to have these experiences on the board is super important for us.

1170
01:56:54,811 --> 01:57:05,096
[SPEAKER_14]: If we had a board that was just interested residents without some of these expertises, you know, this would just not be as functional a board as it is.

1171
01:57:05,416 --> 01:57:09,538
[SPEAKER_14]: So please think about your colleagues who live in Medford and Bush.

1172
01:57:10,098 --> 01:57:10,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1173
01:57:13,591 --> 01:57:21,825
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll push to if you don't want to do it, you can drop me a dime and just say, Alicia, here's who you should reach out to and talk to them.

1174
01:57:21,845 --> 01:57:25,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't have to tell them that you told me.

1175
01:57:33,074 --> 01:57:40,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a different note, I just thought I would flag for folks in our upcoming June meeting.

1176
01:57:41,841 --> 01:57:48,827
[SPEAKER_00]: We are expecting to see some new PDD applications.

1177
01:57:49,327 --> 01:57:52,369
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the first or second meeting of June that we see those.

1178
01:57:54,351 --> 01:57:59,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, get excited, I guess is my advice.

1179
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And Amanda we're still tracking I assume.

1180
01:58:03,123 --> 01:58:17,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing it the June, I think it's the seventh and the 21st would be the correct the seventh and the 21st and I can confirm for you guys that there will be meetings those dates so if I haven't already I'll send out calendar invites that get that around.

1181
01:58:19,373 --> 01:58:29,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things I don't know Amanda if you figured out the dates yet, but there is a zoning change request coming into going to be on the city council agenda on Tuesday so they will be referring it to you.

1182
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:35,204
[SPEAKER_14]: It's over by the Wellington T stop a request to extend the muz area.

1183
01:58:36,445 --> 01:58:41,649
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is particularly for a, there's a parcel there that would like to be housing.

1184
01:58:43,467 --> 01:58:46,532
[SPEAKER_14]: So that'll be coming to you all soon.

1185
01:58:47,413 --> 01:58:48,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are looking at...

1186
01:58:50,815 --> 01:59:05,544
[SPEAKER_14]: how strong our recommendation is that the zone should be contiguous and we should include the MBTA parcel in that as well, because the MBTA themselves are not held to local zoning.

1187
01:59:06,044 --> 01:59:12,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So it actually doesn't impact their rights in any way, but it would make a nicer zone if it was contiguous.

1188
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:19,613
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were just contemplating that in the office and whether we should ask to submit that on behalf of the mayor.

1189
01:59:20,837 --> 01:59:24,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if we can actually get that on the council agenda for Tuesday.

1190
01:59:24,763 --> 01:59:34,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but anyhow, I'm also happy to hear opinions offline if people want to think about that because that's not actually on the agenda I'm just giving you a preview of something that's coming.

1191
01:59:40,187 --> 02:00:04,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, thank you, and I'm definitely open, Jackie, Peter, Ari, if any of you wanna talk more about the possibility of the chair or what it entails or have any other questions, that doesn't bother me, you wanna send me an email, give me a call, I'll meet you someplace in Medford or I'll have you over at the house, beverages included.

1192
02:00:04,852 --> 02:00:08,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a problem at all, happy to do it, okay.

1193
02:00:09,608 --> 02:00:13,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Without any other miscellaneous items I think we're ready to entertain a motion for adjournment.

1194
02:00:16,091 --> 02:00:19,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I sort of question but let's do it after adjournment after adjournment.

1195
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:20,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that sounds good.

1196
02:00:21,354 --> 02:00:21,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1197
02:00:22,595 --> 02:00:24,316
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, motion for adjournment out there.

1198
02:00:25,036 --> 02:00:25,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'll do that.

1199
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:26,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1200
02:00:26,977 --> 02:00:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: In a second.

1201
02:00:28,698 --> 02:00:29,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll second.

1202
02:00:29,839 --> 02:00:30,459
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a second.

1203
02:00:30,579 --> 02:00:31,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, roll call.

1204
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:34,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair, Jackie McPherson.

1205
02:00:35,082 --> 02:00:35,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1206
02:00:38,489 --> 02:00:39,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I Christina.

1207
02:00:39,652 --> 02:00:39,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1208
02:00:40,073 --> 02:00:40,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1209
02:00:40,955 --> 02:00:41,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
