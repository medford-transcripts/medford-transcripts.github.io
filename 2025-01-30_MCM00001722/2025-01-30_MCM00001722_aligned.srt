1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:12,796
So on March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31st, 2025.

2
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:21,239
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present

3
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:26,966
at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

4
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:37,279
The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

5
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,870
Hey, thank you.

6
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:55,254
So the January 29th, 2025 Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting is being called to order.

7
00:00:55,994 --> 00:01:03,896
Secretary, will you please call the roll and send you the full list in the chat?

8
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:05,696
Sorry.

9
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:08,797
Come on.

10
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,778
Oh, jeez, I don't know what's wrong with me.

11
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,920
Okay, here we go.

12
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,561
Jareb Powell, not present.

13
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,263
Bruce Kulik, present.

14
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:28,644
Emilio O'Brien, not present.

15
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,986
Ernie Munier, not present.

16
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:33,307
Doug Packer, not present.

17
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:35,249
Daniel Nuzzo-Miller.

18
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,370
Present.

19
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,332
Noam Rivini, not present.

20
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,635
Mary Kate Gufteson-Cleat, not present.

21
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:45,216
Leah Grudstein.

22
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:46,318
Present.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,363
Rebecca Wright, not present.

24
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,933
With no quorum, we are proceeding with an informational meeting at this time.

25
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:54,938
Sounds good.

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:17,077
In terms of announcements, I have a few updates for infrastructure that I will cover later that pertain to some of the improved bike infrastructure that the city has been able to put in, and some updates about the

27
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:22,901
grant that is connected to the bike racks.

28
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,863
I will cover that at a later point.

29
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:31,888
Aside from that, no other announcements on my side.

30
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:48,080
Oh, aside from this will be covered later as well, WAC Medford did send a letter to DCR requesting changes to several of their intersections due to the fact that the crash near the Mystic Lakes,

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:03:11,183
uh has sadly resulted in a fatality um after the fact so that is the only other update i have there so i'm recording there are no announcements as everything will be covered at a later item on the agenda okay that works uh all right so new board members um

32
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:16,905
At this point, we are looking for new board members where we can get them.

33
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:23,207
I am still trying to get access to all of the resumes that have been sent to the city.

34
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:33,590
That is something that I need to follow up on, and I will do so with both Emily and Jared when I have an opportunity.

35
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,312
I believe we are looking for

36
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:50,392
I believe four to five new members, but we'll have to go over that at a later point since we can't make any binding decisions at this point.

37
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:58,939
Would anyone like to suggest, oh, we actually have Mary Kate.

38
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,243
Hey, Mary Kate.

39
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,604
Mary Kate joined the meeting.

40
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,946
At 7, 11 PM.

41
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,434
All right, we were just getting started.

42
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:26,858
And I've got my own list of things here.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,563
Bruce very kindly offered to take on the note taking duty just so you're off the hook.

44
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:40,822
We were just on the first agenda item, new board members.

45
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:49,790
I am in the process of trying to get the resumes for any of the interest that's been expressed through the city's website.

46
00:04:50,911 --> 00:05:00,641
I do not have any of those resumes at this point, but if anyone has a member of the community that they believe would be a good fit for the

47
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:08,362
By commission, I strongly encourage them to send along.

48
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:22,853
They can either send it along through the city or they can probably, if they need to reach out to get more guidance on where to send things, they could always reach out to the bike commission or me as the chair directly.

49
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:28,657
Recruitment drive.

50
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:39,625
I guess anyone want to say anything on that or we can we can skip over to a.

51
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:47,290
2nd, point 2nd, point it is.

52
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,521
All right, so we're also looking for a new secretary.

53
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:57,544
I've been trying to do double duty as the secretary setting up the agenda.

54
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:06,689
In the meantime, it gets a little difficult juggling things and, you know, finding someone to do note taking duty.

55
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,830
I would appreciate if

56
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:19,818
anyone is able to, you know, either volunteer their time or perhaps know someone who might want to be a new board member who would be interested in being the secretary.

57
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:27,943
So that's the only thing I wanted to say for the next point of order there.

58
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,625
Anyone want to volunteer?

59
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,943
I take that as a no.

60
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:35,524
That's okay.

61
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,507
I know we've asked everyone before.

62
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,249
It's okay.

63
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:41,354
I don't mind the notes part.

64
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:42,236
It's like...

65
00:06:43,704 --> 00:07:08,760
Preparation piece that I would just like bumble every time we might have we might have a good combination then Because I am NOT typically very good at taking notes because they talk too much and Then I listen and then I don't have time to record but I'm fairly good at keeping organized with like the formal Items the announcements the agenda etc.

66
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,563
So and that's the secretary who does that correct, correct?

67
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:12,603
I

68
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:22,294
Yeah, so, um, as long as you're willing to take the notes portion of it, I would be willing to take on the administration portion of it.

69
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,457
Is there anything special that has to happen?

70
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:29,101
Like, after we take the notes, do they get submitted somewhere or are they already just like.

71
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:37,695
They get filed and they're formally, we just approve them, but I've never known that we have to submit them to any place.

72
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,897
Do you recall, Daniel?

73
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:44,682
No, there's no submission that I am aware of.

74
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,263
Amanda might know otherwise.

75
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:53,229
But we keep the notes in a specific Google Drive that we keep.

76
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,873
just for auditing purposes so they are available for anyone who needs them.

77
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:12,262
Aside from that, there is nothing really to be done with notes aside from I rename them from draft to not draft when they get approved by the commission.

78
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:23,450
I'll take on the role of Secretary Pro Tem until the next meeting that we have a forum at and officially bless me as being the Secretary.

79
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,316
That works.

80
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,097
Thank you very much, both of you.

81
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,238
OK, one second.

82
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,619
Let me make a note here.

83
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,243
Thank you for volunteering so that I don't have to do it.

84
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:47,668
Well, like I said, I'm not good at note taking, but Mary Kate, if you're wishing to do it, good job.

85
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,730
And remember, it can always be rotated around.

86
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,992
It does not have to be the same person every time.

87
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:01,311
Wonderful.

88
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,312
Well, we actually got some progress on that point.

89
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:08,193
So that brightens my day.

90
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:22,297
So the speed camera bill, I'm not sure if everyone was aware, but I believe that there is currently a motion to reintroduce speed cameras or legalize speed cameras in the state.

91
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:25,358
The last I heard, it was

92
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:40,256
I forget the actual look that up.

93
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:46,340
But I heard something about there being like a school bus pilot.

94
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,603
It's not speed cam.

95
00:09:50,683 --> 00:10:00,009
It's any type of camera automated enforcement and the pilot would be like people sort of illegally passing stopped school buses.

96
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:03,512
Interesting.

97
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:04,873
Okay, I will.

98
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:08,135
Is there actually a bill that's proposed in either the House or the Senate?

99
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,057
There's a streets blog article about it.

100
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:12,978
I can try to find it.

101
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,751
It's a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026.

102
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:37,757
The legislation also includes provisions to legalize the use of automated speed enforcement cameras across the state.

103
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,320
That's all in the state proposal?

104
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,502
I believe so.

105
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,763
Is there an H number or an S number?

106
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:52,987
That's a good question.

107
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,046
Oh, I guess that would be on the proposal itself.

108
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:00,808
We don't need to worry too much about it.

109
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,010
I just wanted to get as much information as I could.

110
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,131
Understandable.

111
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:12,454
That's something I will look up and try to file at some point.

112
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,617
While we can't make any decisions here, it might be...

113
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:31,106
worthwhile considering how the speed camera bill might be applied to Medford, areas where it could possibly be applied.

114
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:40,375
I believe that it says, I believe some wording I saw, it's one per 5,000 residents.

115
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,641
So we would certainly at least be able to introduce a few.

116
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:51,043
I'm not actually sure what our census would be.

117
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,685
It would be 65 divided by 5, which is 13-ish.

118
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:56,945
Yeah, 13.

119
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,228
I did not actually know what our census was.

120
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:05,849
I'm guessing from the past that it's about 65,000.

121
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,651
That's fair.

122
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:19,316
So it might be worthwhile considering where those could be installed if the city ends up moving forwards with that and the bill moves forward.

123
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:31,523
We would also want to know whether the DCR and other police agencies also are able to deploy them independently or if it's only municipalities that can do so.

124
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:41,120
because obviously a lot of our streets are DCR streets and perhaps the ones that most could use speed cameras.

125
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,263
Very true.

126
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:50,192
So I ever grab a pen when I need a pen.

127
00:12:53,135 --> 00:13:03,748
Um, so actually, I have a question on that because I think I found 2 different streets blog articles and not like, politically savvy enough to tell if these are the same bill.

128
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,552
So there's 1 that was written on January 2nd.

129
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:06,972
Which.

130
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:14,719
Is saying an act relative to bustling enforcement.

131
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,640
So I got confused.

132
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,741
It was not school buses.

133
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,902
It was public transit agency buses.

134
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:24,466
Enforcing bus stops and bustling blockage.

135
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,631
And that was.

136
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:35,354
Approved by voice vote in the house.

137
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,557
Previously passed in the Senate.

138
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:46,535
So it would have made it, I don't know, it would have made it to the governor.

139
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,796
I don't remember hearing that the governor has signed it yet.

140
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:49,776
Yeah.

141
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,416
Interesting.

142
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:58,099
And so as the one we're talking about, I also see an article about a governor proposed one.

143
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,339
Hmm.

144
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,661
Is that later or earlier?

145
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,162
Oh, shoot.

146
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:08,103
I deleted it by accident, which, which is not like, it seems to be just about all.

147
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:11,164
Camera automated enforcement.

148
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:19,865
That 1 is from 6 days ago and mentions taking effect on July 1st, 26.

149
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,886
Oh, both of them.

150
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:23,746
I am.

151
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:41,261
I could look at the listing from the state that's in melegislature.gov, I think it's called, and it provides the text of the laws.

152
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:52,145
So I could look that up and provide that to everybody just so we have the information directly from that website for at least for the next meeting.

153
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:57,368
It might be nice to sort of understand a little bit more about

154
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,864
What the applications could be for the next meeting, if they were going to decide to like.

155
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:06,585
Officially supported or something.

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:17,052
All right, I'll take that upon to look it up and get that out independently.

157
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:21,354
We're done with that.

158
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:23,416
I think so.

159
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:23,856
Yep.

160
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,777
I just wanted to bring that up.

161
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:31,737
I guess I'll cover Walk Medford's DCR letter.

162
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:46,125
Let me see if I've... So Walk Medford ended up putting together... Oops.

163
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:57,959
Um, an official letter to the mayor requesting that.

164
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:04,267
We push for complete streets and that we ask to have.

165
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:12,457
The ability to, I believe, in 4th, let me see if this should.

166
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,934
I don't have a great way of sharing this.

167
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:24,503
I'm also not sure if this was supposed to be shared outside of just the mayor.

168
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,427
But there is, so I won't share the.

169
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:48,800
literal text, but there have been several requests for improvements along DCR roads that have been raised to the mayor in order to see if the mayor is able to negotiate with DCR to gain at least some limited form of

170
00:16:53,883 --> 00:17:00,988
influence, maybe I should say, over some of these DCR controlled roads.

171
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:14,639
Several of these are ones that we have also discussed, so none of these would appear to be anything that we are not currently aware of, but

172
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:30,829
It should be noted that I did as the chair, I did tell Ellery that I would be willing to sign on to this letter.

173
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,951
So I signed on with that.

174
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:45,054
There should be, I'm hopeful that it will end up adding on to like some impact to DCR.

175
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,295
Sorry, I'm just sort of mincing my words at this point.

176
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:53,858
But yeah, I guess basically I just want to bring this up as

177
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,321
There has been a letter that I have signed on to as the chair of the commission.

178
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:07,363
So for the record, I would put down that you are announcing you made an executive decision to sign the letter.

179
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:09,163
That's probably the best way.

180
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:12,644
And if anyone objects, we can bring that up at the next meeting.

181
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:16,005
I don't think that anybody will, but that's the protocol.

182
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:17,505
Sounds good.

183
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:17,965
Yep.

184
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:18,726
Thank you, Bruce.

185
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:24,227
OK.

186
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:34,670
Could you provide a copy of a letter to maybe to the email address?

187
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,790
Yes, I can.

188
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:41,315
Let me reach out to Ellery to confirm that she is okay with me circulating this amongst

189
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:48,610
The, you know, the Medford bike commission, and then I will circulate that letter.

190
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,611
So, as a matter of protocol, if you sign the letter.

191
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:57,154
It would make sense that the members could get a copy just so they know what it is that you signed without approval.

192
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:06,138
So, I would say that's kind of tacit approval that you get provided to the committee, but if you want to check with her.

193
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:15,965
No, that is fair considering it would also be considered within public domain once sent to the mail, I assume.

194
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,666
So that is- Maybe.

195
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:19,566
I don't know.

196
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:23,909
Interesting.

197
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,369
Yeah.

198
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:32,773
I will check with Elry and so I'm taking that upon myself to check with Elry and then I will circulate that letter.

199
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:33,493
Okay.

200
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,041
Let's see.

201
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:41,541
Then.

202
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,882
And that's a recline, right?

203
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:45,022
Yes.

204
00:19:53,465 --> 00:20:00,507
Okay, and I have a few updates that Todd passed along to me in terms of infrastructure.

205
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:07,650
They finally, so they've improved snow clearing on the South Street bike lane.

206
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,433
They finally have a.

207
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:15,266
I guess, a bike lane plow that they're able to use there.

208
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:22,532
So the city will, in the future, make sure to clear out the South Street Contaflo bike lane.

209
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,794
So that will be improved going forward.

210
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:34,521
There is a new Salem eastbound bike lane from Dudley Street to Haines Square.

211
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,590
Grove Street Northwest was painted up.

212
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,271
Hang on.

213
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,114
Dudley to Haines Square.

214
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,395
Yep.

215
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:46,737
What direction did you say that was in?

216
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:48,879
Eastbound.

217
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:49,560
Eastbound.

218
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,000
Okay.

219
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:52,162
Thank you.

220
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,205
No worries.

221
00:20:55,466 --> 00:21:01,572
Grove Street going Northwest was painted up to the Winchester line.

222
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:13,689
There are an Albion Street and Dexter Street bike lane that have been approved, but they have not been painted at this point.

223
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:26,876
The River Road redesign down in West Medford, across from the community center.

224
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:32,338
I forget, what's the name of that tennis and basketball court?

225
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:32,799
Duggar Park.

226
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:34,726
Right Debra park.

227
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,126
Thank you.

228
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:42,872
So that has been approved and is moving forward at least with the contra flow bike lane there.

229
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:43,793
So.

230
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,735
That should be that should be coming in eventually.

231
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:55,663
Hang on I want to clarify a couple items for the Albion street 1. what's the scope?

232
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:07,162
I don't know if I got the complete scope from Todd, or at least I might have been unable to get it down.

233
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:22,486
I believe that they are new bike lanes to be added there, but I am not sure of the directionality and or if they are one-sided in that case.

234
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:25,107
One moment because Albion Street,

235
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:38,274
I'll be in the street in one way, southbound between Medford Street and Broadway, and a small stretch northbound between Medford Street and Main Street.

236
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:46,276
All right, I'll just record that we don't really know, but we have bike lanes in progress.

237
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:50,997
I do know that old area.

238
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:56,478
And the River Road Contra Flow will be in which direction?

239
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,779
I believe that would be northbound.

240
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,181
The contra flow lane.

241
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,904
I believe in front of Duggar Park would be southbound.

242
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,545
Southeast ish bound.

243
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,246
Oh, yeah, okay.

244
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,387
I had my, I had it.

245
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,609
My memory of which direction that road went was incorrect.

246
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:25,690
Okay, got it.

247
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,090
Well, it switches.

248
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,652
Yeah, it becomes two way between Arlington.

249
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:34,413
Well, actually, it turns into Arlington Street, which is two way.

250
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:41,016
Okay, yeah, no, I was going to say it switches actually a few times in there.

251
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:49,176
Okay, so other interesting development.

252
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:56,442
There's now going to be a contraflow on Clippership Drive in Medford Square with a dedicated light to cross.

253
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:03,528
Gosh, why is my brain off Main Street?

254
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:08,732
Yeah, so actually some decent improvements.

255
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,753
That is a temporary or

256
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:25,541
temporary solution while they attempt to complete the barriered bike lane extension along the off-ramp from 93.

257
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,822
Do you know, again, the scope of the counterflow?

258
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:36,303
Will that be from Riverside all the way to Main Street, or will it pick up where the trail joins currently?

259
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,605
I believe it's where the trail will join.

260
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:44,868
The idea is to provide a continuation for the clipper ship connector.

261
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,633
Well, I mean, I'm guessing you're just reading what was said, but it says a dedicated light to cross Main Street.

262
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,595
Is this like a flashing yellow light?

263
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,516
Is there a red light?

264
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:03,440
I do not know exactly, but I believe it is a dedicated signal.

265
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:12,441
So my understanding is that it might actually be a full stoplight.

266
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,802
I did not get the details from Todd.

267
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:19,024
Well, that's interesting.

268
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:30,448
That's a really cramped area between two, one non-functioning signal and the main street at High Street, Forest, Riverside, Salem signal.

269
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,964
It'll be interesting to see how that's connected.

270
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:48,272
This one in particular, but even some of the other ones that you mentioned, I'm having a moment where I'm like, have I ever heard of these projects before in my life?

271
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:53,063
Maybe, maybe not would love.

272
00:25:53,663 --> 00:26:01,984
I, I assume Todd has some like plans or graphics of some kind if, if he knows he's going to build them.

273
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:07,286
So would love for him to send those over if possible.

274
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:14,327
I'll make it a note for me to, uh, see if I can't get any plans from Todd.

275
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,672
Yeah, it's been only casually discussed in the context of.

276
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:23,712
Recording stopped.

277
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:25,473
That's not good.

278
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:26,913
Uh-oh.

279
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,754
Oh, it's because the host left.

280
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:34,175
I think you're the host, Daniel.

281
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:35,155
Am I?

282
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:35,555
Was I?

283
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,856
Yeah, you got made the host.

284
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:38,936
OK.

285
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,917
I am a co-host as well.

286
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:43,997
But I don't see.

287
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:45,298
Recording in progress.

288
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,158
There we go.

289
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:55,271
All right, I got the recording started so Mary Kate in response to not knowing not knowing that these were in progress.

290
00:26:55,691 --> 00:27:00,433
It's only been casually mentioned in the context of a couple of different places.

291
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,034
Like, when we talked about Salem street.

292
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,054
We've talked about the South street.

293
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:15,738
And Todd said, oh, it'd be good to do something about Clippership because we brought it up a few times, but that's basically the extent that's been.

294
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:19,139
That he's mentioned it, so it'd be great if we could.

295
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:19,820
I agree with you.

296
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,460
It'd be great if we could get requested plans just so we can.

297
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:27,662
React to that as well, and I have down down that you're looking into it.

298
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,923
Okay, um.

299
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:46,879
Okay, so they're improving the bike detection infrastructure with a newer set of video recognition systems at Forrest and Lawrence and Medford Square.

300
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:55,827
So some of those crossings, I believe, did not, I'm not sure if they are loop based.

301
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:07,116
I believe they are currently loop based, but they're going to try and move to a video detection system so that bikes have an easier time triggering those lights.

302
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:07,977
Interesting.

303
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:11,199
I never had any difficulty going through that intersection.

304
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:14,082
I thought that was simply a timed intersection.

305
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:20,708
Or maybe it's because there's been automobiles at the same time that I've been there.

306
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:30,937
I was also, I guess, a little interested in that because it does seem like I've never been at that intersection without a car present.

307
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:34,267
Well, it's wait, it's Forrest and Lawrence.

308
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:34,927
Is that what you said?

309
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,090
So did I, I don't think I've ever biked that far.

310
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,491
I've never had a problem on Lawrence.

311
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:41,031
Yeah.

312
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,714
I was like, dang, I do have some intersections that I know do not work for bikes.

313
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:53,840
Well, actually, actually the, um, mystic Valley parkway where all those accidents happen, you can't.

314
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah.

315
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,482
Austin street and mystic Valley parkway doesn't work.

316
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:58,695
Yeah, it doesn't work at all.

317
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:02,096
And it's terrible to try to get onto the pathway over there.

318
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:08,238
And there's actually no, anyway, I could go on forever, but there's nothing, there's no like no turn on red signs.

319
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,960
So cars are just, you know, can turn right whenever they want.

320
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,281
And there's this big hedge right there.

321
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,861
And then we can see it's terribly dangerous.

322
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,963
I wish that bike or I wish that camera was put at that intersection.

323
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,324
So I leave my kids school and go to work.

324
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,085
This is why I keep it there.

325
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:26,606
And yeah, it doesn't detect.

326
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:33,053
It has the things that the cars are supposed to drive over, which work on Lawrence.

327
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:39,620
In my experience, at Lawrence and Winthrop, I've never had an issue.

328
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,544
I've just never biked all the way over to Forest.

329
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:44,934
Yeah.

330
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:45,154
Yeah.

331
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:52,336
I think there's, I think when they repave Winthrop, they put new detectors in and certainly the left lane detector works fine.

332
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:55,417
If you're coming from Winchester to turn left onto Lawrence.

333
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:02,680
Um, I don't know about going left from Lawrence on to Winthrop heading towards the circle.

334
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,920
Cause I, I do.

335
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,820
I've done that.

336
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,841
I have ever gotten that one in all the time.

337
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:07,541
Yeah.

338
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,202
I get to the universalist church.

339
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,842
You gotta take the back roads.

340
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,963
You come down and why many, and you turn right there.

341
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:13,883
Mm-hmm.

342
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,572
And does that detect you?

343
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:16,273
Yep.

344
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,535
Yeah, that's what I thought.

345
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,276
OK, good.

346
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:21,139
Yeah.

347
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,142
I mean, this is sort of like.

348
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:35,816
Uh, making, making my point again, like, I, I don't want to blame Todd because I know that he's like, literally the only staff member he has.

349
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:42,521
And, and he never got another intern or another traffic engineer, which is a huge bummer.

350
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:53,850
So I'll bet he doesn't have a lot of time, but like, if we're a commission that's supposed to advise, we're not advising, we're reacting.

351
00:30:55,091 --> 00:31:02,555
Um, I'm sure that a bunch of us could have told him a lot of intersections around Medford that don't detect bikes.

352
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:06,678
I think we should put that on the agenda for the next meeting.

353
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:10,560
Listen, people will volunteer.

354
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,802
And maybe field check their.

355
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:18,705
Their sense if they can, so that we have an accurate list of.

356
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:22,547
Intersections, which are problematic and maybe ought to be prioritized.

357
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:25,863
Yeah.

358
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:30,006
I'm gonna make a note of this here.

359
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:30,726
Hang on one second.

360
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:35,329
How did you phrase it?

361
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:36,850
Advise versus react?

362
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:39,331
Yeah.

363
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:50,457
Okay.

364
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:52,899
Anything else?

365
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,114
Let me see.

366
00:31:59,254 --> 00:31:59,895
One more.

367
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:02,597
Ah, bike racks.

368
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:07,602
Okay, so that will eventually be moving forward.

369
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:11,786
There was a delay due to the grant program.

370
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:19,806
So it wasn't that the city has never gotten the grant because the grant program had a delay across the entire state.

371
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:25,448
So hopefully that will be moving forward at some point in the very near future.

372
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,189
So that's the update on the bike racks.

373
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,033
And final one is that they are in the process of trying to backfill Amy's position.

374
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,914
So doing what they can there.

375
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:42,595
Is it posted?

376
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:52,004
I don't, Todd did not tell me if it was officially posted or not, but it sounds like they were doing a few interviews.

377
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:59,749
So I suspect they are, it is posted somewhere if they're getting interviews.

378
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,632
If you know of anyone, I'm sure that we could pass along.

379
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:08,575
I mean, like I have Todd on LinkedIn and I didn't see it there.

380
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:08,635
Oh.

381
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:17,086
Well, definitely feel free to reach out to Todd.

382
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:24,407
I mean, at least professionally, I know a lot of traffic engineers, so I'd have been happy to repost it and see who it gets to.

383
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,608
Or the bike commission Facebook page could do so.

384
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:33,109
We should figure out.

385
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,469
Yep, that was the limit of the infrastructure updates.

386
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,130
So just to clarify, you said Amy, is that her name?

387
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:48,605
Um, Amy was the former traffic engineer who was okay.

388
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:51,466
That's what I ended up going to Brookline.

389
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:53,747
All right.

390
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:55,028
A chance, you know, her last name.

391
00:33:55,048 --> 00:34:00,851
I am G. L. E. S. Thank you.

392
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:03,192
Thank you.

393
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:03,492
Great.

394
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:11,496
Um, yes, that is the extent of the infrastructure updates that I.

395
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:13,947
Got from Todd.

396
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,131
Are there any further agenda items?

397
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,193
There are not.

398
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:25,376
All right.

399
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:28,238
So in Leah's interest, I move that we adjourn.

400
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:29,959
Seconded.

401
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,061
All in favor?

402
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:33,182
Aye.

403
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:35,904
I guess that's it.

404
00:34:37,265 --> 00:34:37,905
Meeting adjourned.

405
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,568
Thank you, everyone, for inviting me.

406
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,648
I'll get these notes out.

407
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:45,018
by tomorrow or to tomorrow sometime.

408
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:52,330
If you wrote them down, you can send them to me and I can transcribe them into the Google Docs.

409
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,311
Oh, no, you don't want to do that.

410
00:34:57,206 --> 00:35:04,711
I scribbled them and I will try to get them written up tonight while they're fresh in my memory, at least tomorrow it's not.

411
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:11,335
I jotted stuff down in the notes doc too, so hopefully between the two of us, it's a complete record.

412
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,996
Okay.

413
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:13,597
That's excellent.

414
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:21,181
How about if I send it to you then to turn into information?

415
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:25,004
You just want to look through the Google Doc and see if there's anything you feel like I missed.

416
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,431
Oh, yeah, that would work.

417
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:26,652
Sure.

418
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:29,194
I can update that doc and then I'll be ready to go.

419
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,037
Where does that exist?

420
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,160
I just put it in the chat.

421
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,442
I put a link to it in the chat.

422
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:35,842
Excellent.

423
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:42,971
Thank you.

424
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:43,932
You did?

425
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:52,829
I was going to say, I see, I see your little Bruce Kulik.

426
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,070
Yeah, I'm on it.

427
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,430
You're on it.

428
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,231
I've added a bookmark and we're good.

429
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:00,912
All right.

430
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:01,912
Good night everyone.
