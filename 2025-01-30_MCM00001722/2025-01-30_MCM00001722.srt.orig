1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:12,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So on March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31st, 2025.

2
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:21,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present

3
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:26,966
[SPEAKER_00]: at a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

4
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:37,279
[SPEAKER_00]: The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

5
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thank you.

6
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:55,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So the January 29th, 2025 Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting is being called to order.

7
00:00:55,994 --> 00:01:03,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Secretary, will you please call the roll and send you the full list in the chat?

8
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

10
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, jeez, I don't know what's wrong with me.

11
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel Nuzzo-Miller.

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

19
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Noam Rivini, not present.

[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca Wright, not present.

24
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,933
[SPEAKER_04]: With no quorum, we are proceeding with an informational meeting at this time.

25
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:54,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:17,077
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of announcements, I have a few updates for infrastructure that I will cover later that pertain to some of the improved bike infrastructure that the city has been able to put in, and some updates about the

27
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:22,901
[SPEAKER_03]: grant that is connected to the bike racks.

28
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I will cover that at a later point.

29
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, no other announcements on my side.

30
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:48,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, aside from this will be covered later as well, WAC Medford did send a letter to DCR requesting changes to several of their intersections due to the fact that the crash near the Mystic Lakes,

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:03:11,183
[SPEAKER_03]: uh has sadly resulted in a fatality um after the fact so that is the only other update i have there so i'm recording there are no announcements as everything will be covered at a later item on the agenda okay that works uh all right so new board members um

32
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, we are looking for new board members where we can get them.

33
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I am still trying to get access to all of the resumes that have been sent to the city.

34
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:33,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that I need to follow up on, and I will do so with both Emily and Jared when I have an opportunity.

35
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we are looking for

36
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:50,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe four to five new members, but we'll have to go over that at a later point since we can't make any binding decisions at this point.

37
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:58,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Would anyone like to suggest, oh, we actually have Mary Kate.

38
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mary Kate.

39
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Kate joined the meeting.

40
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: At 7, 11 PM.

41
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,434
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we were just getting started.

42
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:26,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got my own list of things here.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce very kindly offered to take on the note taking duty just so you're off the hook.

44
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:40,822
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just on the first agenda item, new board members.

45
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:49,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in the process of trying to get the resumes for any of the interest that's been expressed through the city's website.

46
00:04:50,911 --> 00:05:00,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have any of those resumes at this point, but if anyone has a member of the community that they believe would be a good fit for the

47
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:08,362
[SPEAKER_03]: By commission, I strongly encourage them to send along.

48
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:22,853
[SPEAKER_03]: They can either send it along through the city or they can probably, if they need to reach out to get more guidance on where to send things, they could always reach out to the bike commission or me as the chair directly.

49
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:28,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Recruitment drive.

50
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:39,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess anyone want to say anything on that or we can we can skip over to a.

51
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:47,290
[SPEAKER_04]: 2nd, point 2nd, point it is.

52
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,521
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we're also looking for a new secretary.

53
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:57,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to do double duty as the secretary setting up the agenda.

54
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:06,689
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, it gets a little difficult juggling things and, you know, finding someone to do note taking duty.

55
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate if

56
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:19,818
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone is able to, you know, either volunteer their time or perhaps know someone who might want to be a new board member who would be interested in being the secretary.

57
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:27,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the only thing I wanted to say for the next point of order there.

58
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone want to volunteer?

59
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that as a no.

60
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:35,524
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

61
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've asked everyone before.

62
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

63
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:41,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind the notes part.

64
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:42,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

65
00:06:43,704 --> 00:07:08,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Preparation piece that I would just like bumble every time we might have we might have a good combination then Because I am NOT typically very good at taking notes because they talk too much and Then I listen and then I don't have time to record but I'm fairly good at keeping organized with like the formal Items the announcements the agenda etc.

66
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So and that's the secretary who does that correct, correct?

67
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:12,603
I

68
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:22,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, um, as long as you're willing to take the notes portion of it, I would be willing to take on the administration portion of it.

69
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything special that has to happen?

70
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:29,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, after we take the notes, do they get submitted somewhere or are they already just like.

71
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: They get filed and they're formally, we just approve them, but I've never known that we have to submit them to any place.

72
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you recall, Daniel?

73
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:44,682
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no submission that I am aware of.

74
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda might know otherwise.

75
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: But we keep the notes in a specific Google Drive that we keep.

76
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,873
[SPEAKER_03]: just for auditing purposes so they are available for anyone who needs them.

77
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:12,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, there is nothing really to be done with notes aside from I rename them from draft to not draft when they get approved by the commission.

78
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:23,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take on the role of Secretary Pro Tem until the next meeting that we have a forum at and officially bless me as being the Secretary.

79
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,316
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.

80
00:08:26,877 --> 00:08:28,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, both of you.

81
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,238
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, one second.

82
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make a note here.

83
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for volunteering so that I don't have to do it.

84
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like I said, I'm not good at note taking, but Mary Kate, if you're wishing to do it, good job.

85
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, it can always be rotated around.

86
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not have to be the same person every time.

87
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:01,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

88
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we actually got some progress on that point.

89
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So that brightens my day.

90
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:22,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So the speed camera bill, I'm not sure if everyone was aware, but I believe that there is currently a motion to reintroduce speed cameras or legalize speed cameras in the state.

91
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: The last I heard, it was

92
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:40,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the actual look that up.

93
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:46,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard something about there being like a school bus pilot.

94
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not speed cam.

95
00:09:50,683 --> 00:10:00,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It's any type of camera automated enforcement and the pilot would be like people sort of illegally passing stopped school buses.

96
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

97
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:04,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will.

98
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:08,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there actually a bill that's proposed in either the House or the Senate?

99
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,057
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a streets blog article about it.

100
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:12,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I can try to find it.

101
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026.

102
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:37,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The legislation also includes provisions to legalize the use of automated speed enforcement cameras across the state.

103
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all in the state proposal?

104
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.

105
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an H number or an S number?

106
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:52,987
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

107
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess that would be on the proposal itself.

108
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:00,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to worry too much about it.

109
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get as much information as I could.

110
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Understandable.

111
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I will look up and try to file at some point.

112
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: While we can't make any decisions here, it might be...

113
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:31,106
[SPEAKER_03]: worthwhile considering how the speed camera bill might be applied to Medford, areas where it could possibly be applied.

114
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:40,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that it says, I believe some wording I saw, it's one per 5,000 residents.

115
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would certainly at least be able to introduce a few.

116
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:51,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not actually sure what our census would be.

117
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be 65 divided by 5, which is 13-ish.

118
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 13.

119
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not actually know what our census was.

120
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:05,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing from the past that it's about 65,000.

121
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.

122
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:19,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be worthwhile considering where those could be installed if the city ends up moving forwards with that and the bill moves forward.

123
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:31,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We would also want to know whether the DCR and other police agencies also are able to deploy them independently or if it's only municipalities that can do so.

124
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: because obviously a lot of our streets are DCR streets and perhaps the ones that most could use speed cameras.

125
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

126
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:50,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ever grab a pen when I need a pen.

127
00:12:53,135 --> 00:13:03,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so actually, I have a question on that because I think I found 2 different streets blog articles and not like, politically savvy enough to tell if these are the same bill.

128
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 1 that was written on January 2nd.

129
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:06,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Which.

130
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:14,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Is saying an act relative to bustling enforcement.

131
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got confused.

132
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not school buses.

133
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It was public transit agency buses.

134
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:24,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Enforcing bus stops and bustling blockage.

135
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was.

136
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:35,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Approved by voice vote in the house.

137
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously passed in the Senate.

138
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:46,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have made it, I don't know, it would have made it to the governor.

139
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember hearing that the governor has signed it yet.

140
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:49,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

141
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

142
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:58,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as the one we're talking about, I also see an article about a governor proposed one.

143
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

144
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that later or earlier?

145
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shoot.

146
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:08,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I deleted it by accident, which, which is not like, it seems to be just about all.

147
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:11,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Camera automated enforcement.

148
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:19,865
[SPEAKER_01]: That 1 is from 6 days ago and mentions taking effect on July 1st, 26.

149
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, both of them.

150
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:23,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

151
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:41,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I could look at the listing from the state that's in melegislature.gov, I think it's called, and it provides the text of the laws.

152
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:52,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could look that up and provide that to everybody just so we have the information directly from that website for at least for the next meeting.

153
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:57,368
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be nice to sort of understand a little bit more about

154
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,864
[SPEAKER_01]: What the applications could be for the next meeting, if they were going to decide to like.

155
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:06,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially supported or something.

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:17,052
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll take that upon to look it up and get that out independently.

157
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:21,354
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done with that.

158
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:23,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

159
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:23,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

160
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to bring that up.

161
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll cover Walk Medford's DCR letter.

162
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:46,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I've... So Walk Medford ended up putting together... Oops.

163
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:57,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, an official letter to the mayor requesting that.

164
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:04,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We push for complete streets and that we ask to have.

165
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:12,457
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability to, I believe, in 4th, let me see if this should.

166
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a great way of sharing this.

167
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:24,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also not sure if this was supposed to be shared outside of just the mayor.

168
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is, so I won't share the.

169
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:48,800
[SPEAKER_03]: literal text, but there have been several requests for improvements along DCR roads that have been raised to the mayor in order to see if the mayor is able to negotiate with DCR to gain at least some limited form of

170
00:16:53,883 --> 00:17:00,988
[SPEAKER_03]: influence, maybe I should say, over some of these DCR controlled roads.

171
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:14,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Several of these are ones that we have also discussed, so none of these would appear to be anything that we are not currently aware of, but

172
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be noted that I did as the chair, I did tell Ellery that I would be willing to sign on to this letter.

173
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So I signed on with that.

174
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:45,054
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be, I'm hopeful that it will end up adding on to like some impact to DCR.

175
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm just sort of mincing my words at this point.

176
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:53,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess basically I just want to bring this up as

177
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,321
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been a letter that I have signed on to as the chair of the commission.

178
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:07,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the record, I would put down that you are announcing you made an executive decision to sign the letter.

179
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:09,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the best way.

180
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:12,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anyone objects, we can bring that up at the next meeting.

181
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:16,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that anybody will, but that's the protocol.

182
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:17,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

183
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

184
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:18,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bruce.

185
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:24,227
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

186
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:34,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you provide a copy of a letter to maybe to the email address?

187
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

188
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:41,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me reach out to Ellery to confirm that she is okay with me circulating this amongst

189
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:48,610
[SPEAKER_03]: The, you know, the Medford bike commission, and then I will circulate that letter.

190
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as a matter of protocol, if you sign the letter.

191
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:57,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make sense that the members could get a copy just so they know what it is that you signed without approval.

192
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:06,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would say that's kind of tacit approval that you get provided to the committee, but if you want to check with her.

193
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:15,965
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that is fair considering it would also be considered within public domain once sent to the mail, I assume.

194
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is- Maybe.

195
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:19,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

196
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:23,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

197
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

198
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:32,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I will check with Elry and so I'm taking that upon myself to check with Elry and then I will circulate that letter.

199
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:33,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

200
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

201
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Then.

202
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a recline, right?

203
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

204
00:19:53,465 --> 00:20:00,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I have a few updates that Todd passed along to me in terms of infrastructure.

205
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: They finally, so they've improved snow clearing on the South Street bike lane.

206
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,433
[SPEAKER_03]: They finally have a.

207
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, a bike lane plow that they're able to use there.

208
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:22,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city will, in the future, make sure to clear out the South Street Contaflo bike lane.

209
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be improved going forward.

210
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new Salem eastbound bike lane from Dudley Street to Haines Square.

211
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Grove Street Northwest was painted up.

212
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.

213
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Dudley to Haines Square.

214
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

215
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What direction did you say that was in?

216
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:48,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastbound.

217
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:49,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Eastbound.

218
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

219
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:52,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

220
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,205
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.

221
00:20:55,466 --> 00:21:01,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Grove Street going Northwest was painted up to the Winchester line.

222
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: There are an Albion Street and Dexter Street bike lane that have been approved, but they have not been painted at this point.

223
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:26,876
[SPEAKER_03]: The River Road redesign down in West Medford, across from the community center.

224
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:32,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget, what's the name of that tennis and basketball court?

225
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:32,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Duggar Park.

226
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:34,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Right Debra park.

227
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

228
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:42,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So that has been approved and is moving forward at least with the contra flow bike lane there.

229
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:43,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

230
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be that should be coming in eventually.

231
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:55,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on I want to clarify a couple items for the Albion street 1. what's the scope?

232
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:07,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I got the complete scope from Todd, or at least I might have been unable to get it down.

233
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:22,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that they are new bike lanes to be added there, but I am not sure of the directionality and or if they are one-sided in that case.

234
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:25,107
[SPEAKER_04]: One moment because Albion Street,

235
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:38,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be in the street in one way, southbound between Medford Street and Broadway, and a small stretch northbound between Medford Street and Main Street.

236
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:46,276
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll just record that we don't really know, but we have bike lanes in progress.

237
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:50,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that old area.

238
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:56,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And the River Road Contra Flow will be in which direction?

239
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that would be northbound.

240
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The contra flow lane.

241
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in front of Duggar Park would be southbound.

242
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Southeast ish bound.

243
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, okay.

244
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my, I had it.

245
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,609
[SPEAKER_04]: My memory of which direction that road went was incorrect.

246
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:25,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, got it.

247
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it switches.

248
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it becomes two way between Arlington.

249
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:34,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, it turns into Arlington Street, which is two way.

250
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:41,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, no, I was going to say it switches actually a few times in there.

251
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:49,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so other interesting development.

252
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:56,442
[SPEAKER_03]: There's now going to be a contraflow on Clippership Drive in Medford Square with a dedicated light to cross.

253
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:03,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, why is my brain off Main Street?

254
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:08,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so actually some decent improvements.

255
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a temporary or

256
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: temporary solution while they attempt to complete the barriered bike lane extension along the off-ramp from 93.

257
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know, again, the scope of the counterflow?

258
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:36,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Will that be from Riverside all the way to Main Street, or will it pick up where the trail joins currently?

259
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's where the trail will join.

260
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is to provide a continuation for the clipper ship connector.

261
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I'm guessing you're just reading what was said, but it says a dedicated light to cross Main Street.

262
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like a flashing yellow light?

263
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a red light?

264
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:03,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know exactly, but I believe it is a dedicated signal.

265
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:12,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So my understanding is that it might actually be a full stoplight.

266
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not get the details from Todd.

267
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:19,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's interesting.

268
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:30,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really cramped area between two, one non-functioning signal and the main street at High Street, Forest, Riverside, Salem signal.

269
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see how that's connected.

270
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:48,272
[SPEAKER_01]: This one in particular, but even some of the other ones that you mentioned, I'm having a moment where I'm like, have I ever heard of these projects before in my life?

271
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:53,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe not would love.

272
00:25:53,663 --> 00:26:01,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I assume Todd has some like plans or graphics of some kind if, if he knows he's going to build them.

273
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:07,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So would love for him to send those over if possible.

274
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:14,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make it a note for me to, uh, see if I can't get any plans from Todd.

275
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been only casually discussed in the context of.

276
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:23,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording stopped.

277
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:25,473
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

278
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:26,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.

279
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's because the host left.

280
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:34,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're the host, Daniel.

281
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:35,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I?

282
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:35,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Was I?

283
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got made the host.

284
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:38,936
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

285
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a co-host as well.

286
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:43,997
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see.

287
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:45,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording in progress.

288
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

289
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:55,271
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I got the recording started so Mary Kate in response to not knowing not knowing that these were in progress.

290
00:26:55,691 --> 00:27:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only been casually mentioned in the context of a couple of different places.

291
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when we talked about Salem street.

292
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,054
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about the South street.

293
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:15,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And Todd said, oh, it'd be good to do something about Clippership because we brought it up a few times, but that's basically the extent that's been.

294
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:19,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That he's mentioned it, so it'd be great if we could.

295
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:19,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.

296
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great if we could get requested plans just so we can.

297
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:27,662
[SPEAKER_04]: React to that as well, and I have down down that you're looking into it.

298
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um.

299
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:46,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they're improving the bike detection infrastructure with a newer set of video recognition systems at Forrest and Lawrence and Medford Square.

300
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:55,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of those crossings, I believe, did not, I'm not sure if they are loop based.

301
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:07,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they are currently loop based, but they're going to try and move to a video detection system so that bikes have an easier time triggering those lights.

302
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

303
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:11,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I never had any difficulty going through that intersection.

304
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:14,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was simply a timed intersection.

305
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:20,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's because there's been automobiles at the same time that I've been there.

306
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:30,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also, I guess, a little interested in that because it does seem like I've never been at that intersection without a car present.

307
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:34,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's wait, it's Forrest and Lawrence.

308
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:34,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you said?

309
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So did I, I don't think I've ever biked that far.

310
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a problem on Lawrence.

311
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:41,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

312
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dang, I do have some intersections that I know do not work for bikes.

313
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:53,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, actually the, um, mystic Valley parkway where all those accidents happen, you can't.

314
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

315
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Austin street and mystic Valley parkway doesn't work.

316
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:58,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't work at all.

317
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:02,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's terrible to try to get onto the pathway over there.

318
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:08,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually no, anyway, I could go on forever, but there's nothing, there's no like no turn on red signs.

319
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So cars are just, you know, can turn right whenever they want.

320
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this big hedge right there.

321
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can see it's terribly dangerous.

322
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that bike or I wish that camera was put at that intersection.

323
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So I leave my kids school and go to work.

324
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,085
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I keep it there.

325
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:26,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it doesn't detect.

326
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:33,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the things that the cars are supposed to drive over, which work on Lawrence.

327
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:39,620
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience, at Lawrence and Winthrop, I've never had an issue.

328
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just never biked all the way over to Forest.

329
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:44,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

330
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:45,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

331
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:52,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's, I think when they repave Winthrop, they put new detectors in and certainly the left lane detector works fine.

332
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:55,417
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're coming from Winchester to turn left onto Lawrence.

333
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know about going left from Lawrence on to Winthrop heading towards the circle.

334
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I, I do.

335
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that.

336
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I have ever gotten that one in all the time.

337
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:07,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

338
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to the universalist church.

339
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta take the back roads.

340
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,963
[SPEAKER_04]: You come down and why many, and you turn right there.

341
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

342
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And does that detect you?

343
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:16,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

344
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

345
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,276
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, good.

346
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:21,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

347
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is sort of like.

348
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:35,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, making, making my point again, like, I, I don't want to blame Todd because I know that he's like, literally the only staff member he has.

349
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:42,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he never got another intern or another traffic engineer, which is a huge bummer.

350
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:53,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll bet he doesn't have a lot of time, but like, if we're a commission that's supposed to advise, we're not advising, we're reacting.

351
00:30:55,091 --> 00:31:02,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure that a bunch of us could have told him a lot of intersections around Medford that don't detect bikes.

352
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:06,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should put that on the agenda for the next meeting.

353
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:10,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, people will volunteer.

354
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe field check their.

355
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:18,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Their sense if they can, so that we have an accurate list of.

356
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Intersections, which are problematic and maybe ought to be prioritized.

357
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:25,863
Yeah.

358
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:30,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna make a note of this here.

359
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:30,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on one second.

360
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you phrase it?

361
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Advise versus react?

362
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:39,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

363
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:50,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

364
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:52,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

365
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

366
00:31:59,254 --> 00:31:59,895
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

367
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:02,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, bike racks.

368
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:07,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that will eventually be moving forward.

369
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:11,786
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a delay due to the grant program.

370
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:19,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't that the city has never gotten the grant because the grant program had a delay across the entire state.

371
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:25,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that will be moving forward at some point in the very near future.

372
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the update on the bike racks.

373
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And final one is that they are in the process of trying to backfill Amy's position.

374
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So doing what they can there.

375
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:42,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it posted?

376
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:52,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, Todd did not tell me if it was officially posted or not, but it sounds like they were doing a few interviews.

377
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:59,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suspect they are, it is posted somewhere if they're getting interviews.

378
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,632
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know of anyone, I'm sure that we could pass along.

379
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:08,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I have Todd on LinkedIn and I didn't see it there.

380
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

381
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:17,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, definitely feel free to reach out to Todd.

382
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:24,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least professionally, I know a lot of traffic engineers, so I'd have been happy to repost it and see who it gets to.

383
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the bike commission Facebook page could do so.

384
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:33,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We should figure out.

385
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that was the limit of the infrastructure updates.

386
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to clarify, you said Amy, is that her name?

387
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:48,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Amy was the former traffic engineer who was okay.

388
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:51,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I ended up going to Brookline.

389
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

390
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:55,028
[SPEAKER_04]: A chance, you know, her last name.

391
00:33:55,048 --> 00:34:00,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I am G. L. E. S. Thank you.

392
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

393
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:03,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

394
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:11,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yes, that is the extent of the infrastructure updates that I.

395
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:13,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Got from Todd.

396
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any further agenda items?

397
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,193
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not.

398
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:25,376
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

399
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:28,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Leah's interest, I move that we adjourn.

400
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:29,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded.

401
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,061
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

402
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

403
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:35,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

404
00:34:37,265 --> 00:34:37,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting adjourned.

405
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone, for inviting me.

406
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get these notes out.

407
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: by tomorrow or to tomorrow sometime.

408
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:52,330
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wrote them down, you can send them to me and I can transcribe them into the Google Docs.

409
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, you don't want to do that.

410
00:34:57,206 --> 00:35:04,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I scribbled them and I will try to get them written up tonight while they're fresh in my memory, at least tomorrow it's not.

411
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:11,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I jotted stuff down in the notes doc too, so hopefully between the two of us, it's a complete record.

412
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

413
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: That's excellent.

414
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:21,181
[SPEAKER_04]: How about if I send it to you then to turn into information?

415
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:25,004
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to look through the Google Doc and see if there's anything you feel like I missed.

416
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that would work.

417
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:26,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

418
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:29,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I can update that doc and then I'll be ready to go.

419
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does that exist?

420
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put it in the chat.

421
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a link to it in the chat.

422
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

423
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:42,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

424
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:43,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You did?

425
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:52,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I see, I see your little Bruce Kulik.

426
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm on it.

427
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on it.

428
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I've added a bookmark and we're good.

429
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

430
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:01,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night everyone.
