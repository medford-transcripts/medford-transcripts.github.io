    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=0.191">So</a>  on March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31st, 2025. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=13.816">Specifically,</a>  this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=21.639">at</a>  a meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=27.427">The</a>  language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=42.19">Hey,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=45.431">So</a>  the January 29th, 2025 Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting is being called to order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=55.994">Secretary,</a>  will you please call the roll and send you the full list in the chat? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=65.336">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=68.317">Come</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=76.716">Oh,</a>  jeez, I don't know what's wrong with me.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=105.857">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=107.08">Rebecca</a>  Wright, not present. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=109.165">With</a>  no quorum, we are proceeding with an informational meeting at this time.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=114.537">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=117.584">In</a>  terms of announcements, I have a few updates for infrastructure that I will cover later that pertain to some of the improved bike infrastructure that the city has been able to put in, and some updates about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=139.118">grant</a>  that is connected to the bike racks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=143.822">I</a>  will cover that at a later point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=147.024">Aside</a>  from that, no other announcements on my side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=152.028">Oh,</a>  aside from this will be covered later as well, WAC Medford did send a letter to DCR requesting changes to several of their intersections due to the fact that the crash near the Mystic Lakes, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=168.94">uh</a>  has sadly resulted in a fatality um after the fact so that is the only other update i have there so i'm recording there are no announcements as everything will be covered at a later item on the agenda okay that works uh all right so new board members um <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=192.323">At</a>  this point, we are looking for new board members where we can get them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=197.545">I</a>  am still trying to get access to all of the resumes that have been sent to the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=204.547">That</a>  is something that I need to follow up on, and I will do so with both Emily and Jared when I have an opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=215.351">I</a>  believe we are looking for <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=218.743">I</a>  believe four to five new members, but we'll have to go over that at a later point since we can't make any binding decisions at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=233.394">Would</a>  anyone like to suggest, oh, we actually have Mary Kate.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=243.242">Hey,</a>  Mary Kate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=244.263">Mary</a>  Kate joined the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=247.825">At</a>  7, 11 PM.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=258.252">All</a>  right, we were just getting started. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=260.454">And</a>  I've got my own list of things here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=268.88">Bruce</a>  very kindly offered to take on the note taking duty just so you're off the hook. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=277.198">We</a>  were just on the first agenda item, new board members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=280.842">I</a>  am in the process of trying to get the resumes for any of the interest that's been expressed through the city's website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=290.911">I</a>  do not have any of those resumes at this point, but if anyone has a member of the community that they believe would be a good fit for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=302.218">By</a>  commission, I strongly encourage them to send along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=308.643">They</a>  can either send it along through the city or they can probably, if they need to reach out to get more guidance on where to send things, they could always reach out to the bike commission or me as the chair directly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=327.796">Recruitment</a>  drive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=332.461">I</a>  guess anyone want to say anything on that or we can we can skip over to a.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=341.366">2nd,</a>  point 2nd, point it is.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=348.259">All</a>  right, so we're also looking for a new secretary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=352.081">I've</a>  been trying to do double duty as the secretary setting up the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=358.845">In</a>  the meantime, it gets a little difficult juggling things and, you know, finding someone to do note taking duty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=366.709">I</a>  would appreciate if <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=368.29">anyone</a>  is able to, you know, either volunteer their time or perhaps know someone who might want to be a new board member who would be interested in being the secretary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=380.458">So</a>  that's the only thing I wanted to say for the next point of order there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=389.504">Anyone</a>  want to volunteer? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=394.061">I</a>  take that as a no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=395.043">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=395.844">I</a>  know we've asked everyone before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=397.527">It's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=399.812">I</a>  don't mind the notes part. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=401.975">It's</a>  like...</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=403.704">Preparation</a>  piece that I would just like bumble every time we might have we might have a good combination then Because I am NOT typically very good at taking notes because they talk too much and Then I listen and then I don't have time to record but I'm fairly good at keeping organized with like the formal Items the announcements the agenda etc. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=429.401">So</a>  and that's the secretary who does that correct, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=433.185">Yeah,</a>  so, um, as long as you're willing to take the notes portion of it, I would be willing to take on the administration portion of it.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=443.635">Is</a>  there anything special that has to happen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=445.497">Like,</a>  after we take the notes, do they get submitted somewhere or are they already just like.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=449.788">They</a>  get filed and they're formally, we just approve them, but I've never known that we have to submit them to any place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=457.715">Do</a>  you recall, Daniel?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=459.957">No,</a>  there's no submission that I am aware of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=464.882">Amanda</a>  might know otherwise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=466.283">But</a>  we keep the notes in a specific Google Drive that we keep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=473.99">just</a>  for auditing purposes so they are available for anyone who needs them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=479.754">Aside</a>  from that, there is nothing really to be done with notes aside from I rename them from draft to not draft when they get approved by the commission.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=493.323">I'll</a>  take on the role of Secretary Pro Tem until the next meeting that we have a forum at and officially bless me as being the Secretary.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=505.916">That</a>  works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=506.877">Thank</a>  you very much, both of you.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=508.437">OK,</a>  one second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=509.338">Let</a>  me make a note here.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=514.561">Thank</a>  you for volunteering so that I don't have to do it.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=520.104">Well,</a>  like I said, I'm not good at note taking, but Mary Kate, if you're wishing to do it, good job.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=527.928">And</a>  remember, it can always be rotated around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=530.75">It</a>  does not have to be the same person every time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=540.911">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=541.392">Well,</a>  we actually got some progress on that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=543.392">So</a>  that brightens my day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=548.894">So</a>  the speed camera bill, I'm not sure if everyone was aware, but I believe that there is currently a motion to reintroduce speed cameras or legalize speed cameras in the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=562.317">The</a>  last I heard, it was <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=570.25">I</a>  forget the actual look that up.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=582.518">But</a>  I heard something about there being like a school bus pilot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=589.122">It's</a>  not speed cam. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=590.683">It's</a>  any type of camera automated enforcement and the pilot would be like people sort of illegally passing stopped school buses.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=602.971">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=603.952">Okay,</a>  I will.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=605.013">Is</a>  there actually a bill that's proposed in either the House or the Senate?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=610.116">There's</a>  a streets blog article about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=612.097">I</a>  can try to find it.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=625.269">It's</a>  a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=627.791">The</a>  legislation also includes provisions to legalize the use of automated speed enforcement cameras across the state.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=641.139">That's</a>  all in the state proposal?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=644.601">I</a>  believe so.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=646.202">Is</a>  there an H number or an S number?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=647.783">That's</a>  a good question.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=655.525">Oh,</a>  I guess that would be on the proposal itself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=659.607">We</a>  don't need to worry too much about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=660.928">I</a>  just wanted to get as much information as I could.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=664.03">Understandable.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=666.191">That's</a>  something I will look up and try to file at some point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=675.496">While</a>  we can't make any decisions here, it might be... <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=680.255">worthwhile</a>  considering how the speed camera bill might be applied to Medford, areas where it could possibly be applied. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=691.126">I</a>  believe that it says, I believe some wording I saw, it's one per 5,000 residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=703.639">So</a>  we would certainly at least be able to introduce a few. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=707.721">I'm</a>  not actually sure what our census would be.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=711.143">It</a>  would be 65 divided by 5, which is 13-ish.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=716.185">Yeah,</a>  13. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=719.927">I</a>  did not actually know what our census was.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=722.248">I'm</a>  guessing from the past that it's about 65,000.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=727.35">That's</a>  fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=729.391">So</a>  it might be worthwhile considering where those could be installed if the city ends up moving forwards with that and the bill moves forward.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=740.697">We</a>  would also want to know whether the DCR and other police agencies also are able to deploy them independently or if it's only municipalities that can do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=753.81">because</a>  obviously a lot of our streets are DCR streets and perhaps the ones that most could use speed cameras.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=762.662">Very</a>  true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=764.765">So</a>  I ever grab a pen when I need a pen.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=773.135">Um,</a>  so actually, I have a question on that because I think I found 2 different streets blog articles and not like, politically savvy enough to tell if these are the same bill. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=784.489">So</a>  there's 1 that was written on January 2nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=786.752">Which.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=789.675">Is</a>  saying an act relative to bustling enforcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=794.779">So</a>  I got confused. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=795.66">It</a>  was not school buses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=796.861">It</a>  was public transit agency buses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=799.823">Enforcing</a>  bus stops and bustling blockage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=807.268">And</a>  that was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=811.552">Approved</a>  by voice vote in the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=816.655">Previously</a>  passed in the Senate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=820.033">So</a>  it would have made it, I don't know, it would have made it to the governor.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=826.555">I</a>  don't remember hearing that the governor has signed it yet.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=829.296">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=829.796">Interesting.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=830.656">And</a>  so as the one we're talking about, I also see an article about a governor proposed one.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=838.119">Hmm.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=840.061">Is</a>  that later or earlier?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=841.901">Oh,</a>  shoot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=843.222">I</a>  deleted it by accident, which, which is not like, it seems to be just about all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=849.143">Camera</a>  automated enforcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=854.204">That</a>  1 is from 6 days ago and mentions taking effect on July 1st, 26. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=860.146">Oh,</a>  both of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=863.626">I</a>  am.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=868.195">I</a>  could look at the listing from the state that's in melegislature.gov, I think it's called, and it provides the text of the laws. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=882.021">So</a>  I could look that up and provide that to everybody just so we have the information directly from that website for at least for the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=892.165">It</a>  might be nice to sort of understand a little bit more about <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=898.34">What</a>  the applications could be for the next meeting, if they were going to decide to like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=904.824">Officially</a>  supported or something.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=906.605">All</a>  right, I'll take that upon to look it up and get that out independently. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=917.072">We're</a>  done with that.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=922.895">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=923.636">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=924.056">I</a>  just wanted to bring that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=927.335">I</a>  guess I'll cover Walk Medford's DCR letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=932.618">Let</a>  me see if I've... So Walk Medford ended up putting together... Oops. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=952.733">Um,</a>  an official letter to the mayor requesting that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=959.281">We</a>  push for complete streets and that we ask to have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=964.287">The</a>  ability to, I believe, in 4th, let me see if this should. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=973.612">I</a>  don't have a great way of sharing this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=975.954">I'm</a>  also not sure if this was supposed to be shared outside of just the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=986.165">But</a>  there is, so I won't share the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=990.643">literal</a>  text, but there have been several requests for improvements along DCR roads that have been raised to the mayor in order to see if the mayor is able to negotiate with DCR to gain at least some limited form of <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1013.883">influence,</a>  maybe I should say, over some of these DCR controlled roads. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1022.369">Several</a>  of these are ones that we have also discussed, so none of these would appear to be anything that we are not currently aware of, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1036.037">It</a>  should be noted that I did as the chair, I did tell Ellery that I would be willing to sign on to this letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1051.69">So</a>  I signed on with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1054.349">There</a>  should be, I'm hopeful that it will end up adding on to like some impact to DCR. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1065.074">Sorry,</a>  I'm just sort of mincing my words at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1068.816">But</a>  yeah, I guess basically I just want to bring this up as <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1075.7">There</a>  has been a letter that I have signed on to as the chair of the commission.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1081.401">So</a>  for the record, I would put down that you are announcing you made an executive decision to sign the letter.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1088.183">That's</a>  probably the best way.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1089.443">And</a>  if anyone objects, we can bring that up at the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1092.924">I</a>  don't think that anybody will, but that's the protocol.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1097.045">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1097.765">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1098.185">Thank</a>  you, Bruce.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1104.187">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1106.643">Could</a>  you provide a copy of a letter to maybe to the email address?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1115.05">Yes,</a>  I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1116.271">Let</a>  me reach out to Ellery to confirm that she is okay with me circulating this amongst <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1123.007">The,</a>  you know, the Medford bike commission, and then I will circulate that letter.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1129.01">So,</a>  as a matter of protocol, if you sign the letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1132.311">It</a>  would make sense that the members could get a copy just so they know what it is that you signed without approval. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1138.654">So,</a>  I would say that's kind of tacit approval that you get provided to the committee, but if you want to check with her.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1147.04">No,</a>  that is fair considering it would also be considered within public domain once sent to the mail, I assume. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1156.665">So</a>  that is- Maybe.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1158.686">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1163.428">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1164.329">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1165.649">I</a>  will check with Elry and so I'm taking that upon myself to check with Elry and then I will circulate that letter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1173.273">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1179.14">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1181.281">Then.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1182.581">And</a>  that's a recline, right?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1184.762">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1193.465">Okay,</a>  and I have a few updates that Todd passed along to me in terms of infrastructure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1202.933">They</a>  finally, so they've improved snow clearing on the South Street bike lane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1207.67">They</a>  finally have a. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1210.703">I</a>  guess, a bike lane plow that they're able to use there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1216.027">So</a>  the city will, in the future, make sure to clear out the South Street Contaflo bike lane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1222.552">So</a>  that will be improved going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1227.615">There</a>  is a new Salem eastbound bike lane from Dudley Street to Haines Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1238.348">Grove</a>  Street Northwest was painted up.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1240.67">Hang</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1242.132">Dudley</a>  to Haines Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1244.134">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1245.515">What</a>  direction did you say that was in?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1248.478">Eastbound.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1249.199">Eastbound.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1249.78">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1251.882">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1253.243">No</a>  worries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1255.466">Grove</a>  Street going Northwest was painted up to the Winchester line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1266.766">There</a>  are an Albion Street and Dexter Street bike lane that have been approved, but they have not been painted at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1277.571">The</a>  River Road redesign down in West Medford, across from the community center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1288.096">I</a>  forget, what's the name of that tennis and basketball court? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1292.358">Duggar</a>  Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1293.985">Right</a>  Debra park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1294.766">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1296.527">So</a>  that has been approved and is moving forward at least with the contra flow bike lane there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1303.453">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1304.574">That</a>  should be that should be coming in eventually.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1309.978">Hang</a>  on I want to clarify a couple items for the Albion street 1. what's the scope?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1318.92">I</a>  don't know if I got the complete scope from Todd, or at least I might have been unable to get it down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1329.323">I</a>  believe that they are new bike lanes to be added there, but I am not sure of the directionality and or if they are one-sided in that case.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1342.506">One</a>  moment because Albion Street, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1348.792">I'll</a>  be in the street in one way, southbound between Medford Street and Broadway, and a small stretch northbound between Medford Street and Main Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1358.294">All</a>  right, I'll just record that we don't really know, but we have bike lanes in progress.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1367.016">I</a>  do know that old area.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1371.537">And</a>  the River Road Contra Flow will be in which direction? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1379.639">I</a>  believe that would be northbound.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1384.161">The</a>  contra flow lane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1387.382">I</a>  believe in front of Duggar Park would be southbound. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1394.505">Southeast</a>  ish bound.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1398.226">Oh,</a>  yeah, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1399.306">I</a>  had my, I had it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1401.908">My</a>  memory of which direction that road went was incorrect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1404.869">Okay,</a>  got it.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1406.05">Well,</a>  it switches.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1407.11">Yeah,</a>  it becomes two way between Arlington. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1410.672">Well,</a>  actually, it turns into Arlington Street, which is two way.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1414.594">Okay,</a>  yeah, no, I was going to say it switches actually a few times in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1426.474">Okay,</a>  so other interesting development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1429.236">There's</a>  now going to be a contraflow on Clippership Drive in Medford Square with a dedicated light to cross. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1438.584">Gosh,</a>  why is my brain off Main Street? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1443.548">Yeah,</a>  so actually some decent improvements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1448.872">That</a>  is a temporary or <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1451.918">temporary</a>  solution while they attempt to complete the barriered bike lane extension along the off-ramp from 93.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1465.641">Do</a>  you know, again, the scope of the counterflow? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1469.842">Will</a>  that be from Riverside all the way to Main Street, or will it pick up where the trail joins currently?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1477.143">I</a>  believe it's where the trail will join. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1480.065">The</a>  idea is to provide a continuation for the clipper ship connector.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1488.69">Well,</a>  I mean, I'm guessing you're just reading what was said, but it says a dedicated light to cross Main Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1493.674">Is</a>  this like a flashing yellow light? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1495.755">Is</a>  there a red light?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1499.017">I</a>  do not know exactly, but I believe it is a dedicated signal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1504.338">So</a>  my understanding is that it might actually be a full stoplight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1513.101">I</a>  did not get the details from Todd.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1517.843">Well,</a>  that's interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1519.244">That's</a>  a really cramped area between two, one non-functioning signal and the main street at High Street, Forest, Riverside, Salem signal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1533.062">It'll</a>  be interesting to see how that's connected.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1537.345">This</a>  one in particular, but even some of the other ones that you mentioned, I'm having a moment where I'm like, have I ever heard of these projects before in my life? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1550.322">Maybe,</a>  maybe not would love. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1553.663">I,</a>  I assume Todd has some like plans or graphics of some kind if, if he knows he's going to build them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1562.344">So</a>  would love for him to send those over if possible.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1568.166">I'll</a>  make it a note for me to, uh, see if I can't get any plans from Todd.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1579.011">Yeah,</a>  it's been only casually discussed in the context of.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1582.712">Recording</a>  stopped.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1584.933">That's</a>  not good.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1586.653">Uh-oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1589.314">Oh,</a>  it's because the host left.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1591.434">I</a>  think you're the host, Daniel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1594.775">Am</a>  I?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1595.175">Was</a>  I?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1596.135">Yeah,</a>  you got made the host.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1598.856">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1598.956">I</a>  am a co-host as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1603.197">But</a>  I don't see.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1604.097">Recording</a>  in progress.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1605.318">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1607.468">All</a>  right, I got the recording started so Mary Kate in response to not knowing not knowing that these were in progress. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1615.691">It's</a>  only been casually mentioned in the context of a couple of different places. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1620.493">Like,</a>  when we talked about Salem street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1622.554">We've</a>  talked about the South street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1626.835">And</a>  Todd said, oh, it'd be good to do something about Clippership because we brought it up a few times, but that's basically the extent that's been. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1635.758">That</a>  he's mentioned it, so it'd be great if we could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1639.299">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1639.84">It'd</a>  be great if we could get requested plans just so we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1643.381">React</a>  to that as well, and I have down down that you're looking into it.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1647.682">Okay,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1651.85">Okay,</a>  so they're improving the bike detection infrastructure with a newer set of video recognition systems at Forrest and Lawrence and Medford Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1668.741">So</a>  some of those crossings, I believe, did not, I'm not sure if they are loop based. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1676.107">I</a>  believe they are currently loop based, but they're going to try and move to a video detection system so that bikes have an easier time triggering those lights.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1687.576">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1688.557">I</a>  never had any difficulty going through that intersection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1691.219">I</a>  thought that was simply a timed intersection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1694.102">Or</a>  maybe it's because there's been automobiles at the same time that I've been there.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1701.088">I</a>  was also, I guess, a little interested in that because it does seem like I've never been at that intersection without a car present.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1711.645">Well,</a>  it's wait, it's Forrest and Lawrence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1714.347">Is</a>  that what you said? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1716.028">So</a>  did I, I don't think I've ever biked that far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1719.11">I've</a>  never had a problem on Lawrence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1720.931">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1721.051">I</a>  was like, dang, I do have some intersections that I know do not work for bikes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1726.215">Well,</a>  actually, actually the, um, mystic Valley parkway where all those accidents happen, you can't.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1733.92">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1734.4">Austin</a>  street and mystic Valley parkway doesn't work.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1737.274">Yeah,</a>  it doesn't work at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1738.755">And</a>  it's terrible to try to get onto the pathway over there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1742.176">And</a>  there's actually no, anyway, I could go on forever, but there's nothing, there's no like no turn on red signs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1748.779">So</a>  cars are just, you know, can turn right whenever they want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1753.0">And</a>  there's this big hedge right there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1754.301">And</a>  then we can see it's terribly dangerous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1756.281">I</a>  wish that bike or I wish that camera was put at that intersection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1760.183">So</a>  I leave my kids school and go to work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1763.164">This</a>  is why I keep it there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1765.485">And</a>  yeah, it doesn't detect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1767.027">It</a>  has the things that the cars are supposed to drive over, which work on Lawrence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1773.393">In</a>  my experience, at Lawrence and Winthrop, I've never had an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1779.64">I've</a>  just never biked all the way over to Forest.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1784.734">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1784.974">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1785.174">I</a>  think there's, I think when they repave Winthrop, they put new detectors in and certainly the left lane detector works fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1792.716">If</a>  you're coming from Winchester to turn left onto Lawrence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1796.278">Um,</a>  I don't know about going left from Lawrence on to Winthrop heading towards the circle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1802.72">Cause</a>  I, I do.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1804.22">I've</a>  done that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1804.86">I</a>  have ever gotten that one in all the time.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1807.281">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1807.741">I</a>  get to the universalist church. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1809.242">You</a>  gotta take the back roads.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1811.022">You</a>  come down and why many, and you turn right there.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1812.983">Mm-hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1814.571">And</a>  does that detect you?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1816.113">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1816.694">Yeah,</a>  that's what I thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1817.615">OK,</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1820.939">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1821.84">I</a>  mean, this is sort of like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1825.207">Uh,</a>  making, making my point again, like, I, I don't want to blame Todd because I know that he's like, literally the only staff member he has. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1835.836">And,</a>  and he never got another intern or another traffic engineer, which is a huge bummer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1842.661">So</a>  I'll bet he doesn't have a lot of time, but like, if we're a commission that's supposed to advise, we're not advising, we're reacting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1855.091">Um,</a>  I'm sure that a bunch of us could have told him a lot of intersections around Medford that don't detect bikes.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1863.976">I</a>  think we should put that on the agenda for the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1867.578">Listen,</a>  people will volunteer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1870.58">And</a>  maybe field check their. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1875.323">Their</a>  sense if they can, so that we have an accurate list of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1879.485">Intersections,</a>  which are problematic and maybe ought to be prioritized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1888.965">I'm</a>  gonna make a note of this here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1890.046">Hang</a>  on one second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1894.548">How</a>  did you phrase it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1895.629">Advise</a>  versus react?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1899.071">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1910.097">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1912.379">Anything</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1915.79">Let</a>  me see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1919.254">One</a>  more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1919.915">Ah,</a>  bike racks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1923.158">Okay,</a>  so that will eventually be moving forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1929.064">There</a>  was a delay due to the grant program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1933.243">So</a>  it wasn't that the city has never gotten the grant because the grant program had a delay across the entire state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1941.186">So</a>  hopefully that will be moving forward at some point in the very near future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1946.528">So</a>  that's the update on the bike racks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1951.75">And</a>  final one is that they are in the process of trying to backfill Amy's position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1957.973">So</a>  doing what they can there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1961.915">Is</a>  it posted? <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1964.158">I</a>  don't, Todd did not tell me if it was officially posted or not, but it sounds like they were doing a few interviews. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1974.025">So</a>  I suspect they are, it is posted somewhere if they're getting interviews. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1980.409">If</a>  you know of anyone, I'm sure that we could pass along.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1984.572">I</a>  mean, like I have Todd on LinkedIn and I didn't see it there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1988.595">Oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1992.465">Well,</a>  definitely feel free to reach out to Todd.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=1997.486">I</a>  mean, at least professionally, I know a lot of traffic engineers, so I'd have been happy to repost it and see who it gets to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2005.807">Or</a>  the bike commission Facebook page could do so.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2008.628">We</a>  should figure out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2013.909">Yep,</a>  that was the limit of the infrastructure updates.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2017.929">So</a>  just to clarify, you said Amy, is that her name?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2022.862">Um,</a>  Amy was the former traffic engineer who was okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2028.885">That's</a>  what I ended up going to Brookline.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2031.486">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2033.947">A</a>  chance, you know, her last name.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001804_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2035.048">I</a>  am G. L. E. S. Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2042.872">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2043.252">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2045.673">Um,</a>  yes, that is the extent of the infrastructure updates that I. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2053.286">Got</a>  from Todd.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2058.53">Are</a>  there any further agenda items?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2061.352">There</a>  are not.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2063.994">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2065.416">So</a>  in Leah's interest, I move that we adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2069.519">Seconded.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2071.42">All</a>  in favor?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2073.062">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2073.202">I</a>  guess that's it.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2077.265">Meeting</a>  adjourned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2077.986">Thank</a>  you, everyone, for inviting me.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2080.708">I'll</a>  get these notes out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2083.155">by</a>  tomorrow or to tomorrow sometime.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2085.899">If</a>  you wrote them down, you can send them to me and I can transcribe them into the Google Docs.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2092.39">Oh,</a>  no, you don't want to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2097.206">I</a>  scribbled them and I will try to get them written up tonight while they're fresh in my memory, at least tomorrow it's not.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2104.771">I</a>  jotted stuff down in the notes doc too, so hopefully between the two of us, it's a complete record.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2111.735">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2113.036">That's</a>  excellent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2113.637">How</a>  about if I send it to you then to turn into information?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001790_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2121.322">You</a>  just want to look through the Google Doc and see if there's anything you feel like I missed.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2125.49">Oh,</a>  yeah, that would work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2126.451">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2127.012">I</a>  can update that doc and then I'll be ready to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2129.795">Where</a>  does that exist?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2132.979">I</a>  just put it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2134.3">I</a>  put a link to it in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2135.502">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2135.882">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2143.631">You</a>  did?</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2147.107">I</a>  was going to say, I see, I see your little Bruce Kulik.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2153.609">Yeah,</a>  I'm on it.</p>

    <p>[Daniel Nuzzo-Mueller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2155.97">You're</a>  on it.</p>

    <p>[Bruce Kulik]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2157.151">I've</a>  added a bookmark and we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2160.632">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/bicycle-advisory-commission-01-29-25&start=2161.432">Good</a>  night everyone.</p>
