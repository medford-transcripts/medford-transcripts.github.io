<h2><a href="../2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE/2017-10-05_r-uaa_v8IPE.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 21, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10353.807s">Thank</a> you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10356.269s">If</a> the mayor listens to me on this, she's going to get a lot of hard phone calls and some emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10364.897s">Unfortunately,</a> she has started a bad precedent for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10368.132s">While</a> I appreciate the intent of public awareness of certain city-sponsored events, posting them on City Hall's outside wall is an inappropriate place to display such information. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10379.639s">City</a> Hall is the seat of our government, not a billboard for city-wide information. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10385.022s">I</a> find it cheapens the city in a few ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10388.104s">One,</a> it unknowingly sets up favorite versus non-favorite groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10393.187s">While</a> some are vocal, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10394.902s">There</a> may be other groups that feel intimidated to speak in opposition of the quote, favorite group, which has already attained preference in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10405.664s">This</a> unseen bias can create unnecessary resentment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10409.324s">It</a> can pit one group against the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10412.105s">Eventually,</a> we may have two groups who will oppose each other in concept, wanting to be represented on City Hall, i.e., pro-life versus pro-choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10421.527s">This</a> is a dangerous practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10424.524s">It</a> detracts from the visual image of the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10428.065s">Our</a> City Hall was built in a time of magnificent architecture. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10431.867s">The</a> banners detract from the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10433.507s">flag,</a> which should be the only thing on a person's mind as they pass City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10438.469s">Yes,</a> the MIA flag is there as well, for a reason that you should already also be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10446.032s">Three,</a> the banners are distracting to drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10449.813s">Four,</a> and most importantly, it detracts from the true purpose of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10454.71s">to</a> be the people's house, the building which holds the right of everyone to enter and express their views in the way that they would like to be governed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10464.159s">We</a> should revere this building as peoples all around the world would die to have a building such as this, where their voices could be heard, not to be an advertisement space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10480.917s">I</a> understand why the gay community wanted to see the rainbow flag up on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10485.799s">It</a> was simply for affirmation, which is an understandable goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10490.22s">So</a> since I am asking the mayor not to put up the flag in June, I feel obligated to make at least three other suggestions to affirm the gay population in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10501.444s">They</a> are as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10502.905s">We</a> can interview people who are gay on a TV show through the new access station <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10509.058s">We</a> can write a book on gays who live in Medford, and I would recommend Carl Seberg to top the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10515.443s">We</a> can rent the Chevalier Theater and hold a celebration of gay life through a musical. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10520.266s">We</a> can organize a pizza night for gays at a certain restaurant and invite straights who want to support them, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10527.611s">I</a> hope that these other avenues will be received in the spirit that I offer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10531.955s">If</a> the city would like to sponsor something, they could hold a night at the library in June <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10538.333s">where</a> they have readings on gay material or have gay speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10545.698s">These</a> are actually more grassroots methods and require the gay community to advocate for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10550.781s">And</a> seeing this, it will commit more people to participate in the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10557.045s">And</a> by example, they will lead and be better received. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10560.367s">In</a> conclusion, I am therefore respectfully asking you to take down any and all ads for future events <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10567.168s">or</a> community communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10570.769s">For</a> they disrespect the purpose and solemnity in which this building deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10575.229s">This</a> is not to say that any of the causes are unworthy of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10579.61s">This</a> is just not the place for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10581.39s">Thank</a> you for considering my request.<h2><a href="../2016-10-27_tUX_rthPMVU/2016-10-27_tUX_rthPMVU.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 25, 2016

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=320.528s">Gene</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=321.789s">Thank</a> you very much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=324.59s">My</a> question is, why would they be being pulled away? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=328.498s">It</a> is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=329.84s">All</a> DPW issues are a public safety issue, whether it's snow removal, whether it's trash removal, whether it's manhole covers, whether it's those rain drain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=341.253s">If</a> they're not set right, somebody can get into a car or an accident or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=346.179s">So</a> the DPW is definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=349.075s">interwoven</a> with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=351.775s">There</a> is absolutely no question about it, that if you can't drive down the street safely, then it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=357.717s">And</a> it has to do with that whole overview that I stated and I implore the mayor to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=362.877s">The</a> whole city needs to be evaluated for traffic flow, sidewalks, bicycles, buses, trucks, the whole nine yards, everything, including striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=373.599s">And</a> I think that striping, and I agree with Mr. Knight <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=378.338s">That</a> it's absolutely, it's absolutely a basic function of the city that we have proper striping, proper signs so that everybody knows where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=387.683s">But</a> I wonder, the question that comes to my mind is, why are they being pulled away from the sign department in the first place? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=395.267s">And</a> that's because we are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=397.128s">So</a> we need to look at that, but we can't look at staffing until we understand and assess the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=403.312s">You</a> have to look at it from the entire city's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=406.289s">If</a> you don't assess the whole city and all of its needs, then you're just playing a little game patch here and patch here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=414.294s">And</a> why are they being pulled away? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=415.495s">So</a> they're going to be pulled away, and then some other part of DPW is going to go unresolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=421.778s">So</a> we have to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=424.953s">I</a> think it's a great idea, and I absolutely urge the city to hire more workers, especially for sections in the city, the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=432.595s">They</a> can be the eyes and ears for the police in Haines Square, Medford Square, all the squares, South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=439.037s">We</a> can have section people all over the place cleaning them up and keeping them up, even if it's only Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=445.239s">So</a> you have to look at it from a whole perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=447.858s">And</a> I think that that's, you know, I asked the mayor to look at it from a whole perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=452.121s">And</a> if they get pulled away, then there's going to be a hole someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=457.486s">There's</a> going to be a lack someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=459.467s">So,</a> putting them in their own division helps the signage, but it's going to cause a problem someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=466.053s">So,</a> thank you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3805.354s">I</a> mean, there's, you know, I mean, there's no, and the other thing is elderly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3809.889s">Because</a> when you're talking about the Fellsway, I know some elderly ladies that go to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3813.172s">Francis</a> and they walk down there, and they go down to the senior citizen center, and they walk, some of them actually walk down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3820.758s">So</a> it's very, very dangerous for seniors as well, because they can't scoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3824.701s">So</a> I'm begging the mayor to really take a good look at the overview of the city, because otherwise it comes down to the bottom, and those people at the bottom get crushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3834.909s">And</a> if we need to hire more, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3837.933s">auxiliary</a> for the crossing guards, then we have to find the money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3842.674s">So</a> that when there's a sick call or something, that there's a replacement for that person, because you can't use the police, unless you're going to use the police for crossing guards, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3851.637s">But</a> you can't use the police, it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3855.518s">There's</a> a reason why we have the police, why we have the crossing guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3858.638s">The</a> crossing guards are there to cross the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3862.159s">And</a> so if you pull them, we don't have enough to pull off the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3865.658s">Because</a> what if there's an actual emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3868.059s">Now</a> you've got to catch 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3869.6s">It's</a> one thing when they're on a site for National Grid, they can be pulled away because, you know, but how can you leave, abandon a site where it's a crossing guard for an hour when you have a robbery or something or something more important? <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3882.486s">Now</a> you have to, the cop has to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3884.967s">And</a> he shouldn't have to or she shouldn't have to be in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3887.686s">So</a> I really, really, really, I hope that she looks at the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3893.792s">You</a> need a city engineer, you need to do this, and it's not gonna get any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3897.956s">Thank</a> you so much.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI/2025-03-18_xPBP-EonBGI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 11, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5102.767s">And</a> you're just going crazy, just playing whack-a-mole. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5106.641s">stop</a> them here, stop them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5108.101s">There</a> is no flow pattern to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5110.942s">And</a> this includes, and before you talk about policing, you really do need to look at the macro picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5115.864s">And</a> the macro picture is, is that we, we have been, we have no regular scheduled street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5124.347s">Cars</a> are up on sidewalks, seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5127.287s">Drive</a> around, you'll see them parked up on sidewalks, half on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5130.889s">Fulton</a> Street, places where you can't get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5132.869s">Riverside</a> Ave, where you can't get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5134.77s">These</a> are two lane, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5136.641s">Highways</a> with the two yellow lines, these are not like little side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5140.563s">So</a> you have to look at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5142.084s">If</a> you don't look at the big picture, then you're just throwing good money after bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5146.466s">That's</a> all you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5148.067s">And</a> so, priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5152.389s">I'm</a> gonna get to the facts about what the police are up to, but you have to talk about priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5158.692s">I</a> don't like it when people say, well, we should ask the people what they want out of their government locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5163.709s">No,</a> you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5164.71s">There</a> are certain mandates that a government, a local government, a state government, or a federal government must provide before you get into any of the offshoots, any of the luxuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5177.096s">And</a> if you don't get in, and if you don't provide those basics, then you have no luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5181.599s">You</a> can have all the cupcakes you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5183.66s">Man,</a> if you don't have any spinach, you're going to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5186.861s">It's</a> that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5188.082s">And</a> so you really need to look at, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5190.973s">what</a> the city needs as opposed to what the city wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5194.199s">So</a> I don't like the idea of sending out a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5196.945s">They</a> want this, they want that, they want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5198.748s">Sure,</a> they want the sky, but they can't have the sky, because there's only so much money in the bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5204.344s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out there, because if you don't look at the macro, then you can't even get to the policing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5210.432s">The</a> police, we have a total of 103 budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5214.718s">We're</a> going to have four more come online to 107. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5217.221s">We're</a> budgeted for 107. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5217.882s">This</a> is a city of 58. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5222.528s">8,000</a> people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5223.349s">We</a> are close to Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5224.77s">They</a> put on seven new lines, airlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5227.753s">We</a> have Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5229.434s">I</a> just talked to a guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5230.595s">They</a> have gangs, official organized gangs in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5233.638s">It</a> doesn't take much to come over here, folks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5236.42s">The</a> city ourselves have social ills. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5239.323s">We</a> have people who they call the police because their son is acting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5244.267s">They</a> can't take care of their son, so they call the police on their son to get him <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5247.783s">hauled</a> out of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5249.405s">I</a> mean, they're not just doing, they're doing fraud, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5253.689s">They're</a> doing social, they're doing stupidity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5256.251s">Somebody</a> puts a pizza box in their oven to heat up the pizza, sets it on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5262.657s">I</a> mean, they deal with stupidity, they deal with real crimes, they deal with murder, they deal with rape, they deal with all of the ugly issues that we don't want to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5274.052s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5275.353s">I'm</a> going to talk pros and I'm going to talk cons because, you know, it needs to be talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5282.498s">We</a> have two civilian clerks and one halftime clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5286.782s">And</a> one of the things the chief told me is that he used to have more civilians working for him, but when the budget cuts came and they had to delete and they had to delete, they deleted from the civilian population because they needed the officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5304.1s">They</a> need the officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5306.603s">But</a> they also need the civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5307.984s">Because</a> we're farming out everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5310.767s">We're</a> farming out DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5312.129s">It's</a> completely gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5314.071s">So</a> why not farm out some clerical, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5318.937s">We</a> need to increase the budget for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5322.24s">In</a> so many ways, it's not even funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5324.805s">The</a> DPW used to do snow removal, used to do garbage removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5329.067s">Now</a> they don't even do a stupid sidewalk, cement, little square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5333.73s">They</a> can't even do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5336.652s">What</a> else are we going to farm out? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5338.753s">Where</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5339.233s">Where</a> does it end where we farm out? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5344.416s">You</a> need a government. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5345.297s">You</a> need an elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5347.038s">Then</a> you need a police force to enforce the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5350.84s">And</a> then you need a DPW, even before a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5354.382s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5355.012s">Because</a> if you can't get down that street, because there is no street, no access through the street, you can't get to the house on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5361.417s">And</a> that is exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5363.159s">We</a> are not looking at the priorities in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5367.562s">You</a> don't have to like me, but you have to listen to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5370.225s">That's</a> my right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5371.265s">And</a> that's the First Amendment, and God bless it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5376.67s">911</a> dispatches, we have nine with backups. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5378.872s">Patrol</a> officers, 75. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5382.313s">75,</a> now this is three, this is around the clock, people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5388.175s">This</a> is around the clock, seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5390.976s">That</a> is Monday through Friday, seven days a week, 75 patrol officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5394.918s">You</a> do the math and tell me if that's enough for a city this size with as many problems as we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5401.14s">So</a> close to Boston, I know, I'm lecturing, I know, but it makes me feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5406.502s">Get</a> it off my chest. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5407.242s">We</a> have 14 detectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5412.39s">Computer</a> crimes are up, in case you hadn't noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5415.451s">There's</a> all kinds of cyber crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5419.393s">Sergeants,</a> 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5420.613s">Lieutenants,</a> nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5422.254s">Captains,</a> three. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5425.435s">The</a> recommendation, be a minimum by the chief, is 115, which I think is way too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5431.757s">I</a> absolutely think 115 cops, and that's like a huge, they would be excited to get that many. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5438.914s">And</a> I think for 58,000, this close, we've got a six-mile radius of people congested. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5447.038s">Some</a> certain neighborhoods aren't congested, and others are loaded down, absolutely loaded down. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5456.101s">Total</a> vehicles in the department, including unmarked of 45, suburbans have 50,000 to 60,000 miles on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5467.318s">The</a> Crown Vics have 100,000 on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5471.601s">And</a> I asked him what recommended, if he had a Christmas list, what would it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5475.603s">And</a> of course, he said a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5477.424s">That's</a> absolutely pie in the sky at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5482.547s">Because</a> the city has not recognized that the police should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5487.19s">They</a> have not recognized that the police has come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5489.671s">And</a> that comes from the top, and that comes from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5492.152s">I</a> know you guys say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5494.028s">But</a> the people also need to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5496.17s">The</a> people out there need to demand that police come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5499.995s">And</a> as bad as it is, if it wasn't for these accidents, especially in the neighborhoods that they were in, we wouldn't be talking about this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5509.506s">And</a> I'm so grateful that people that actually have political pull in this city are coming forward and talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5519.63s">As</a> far as training, they need to be doing training. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5522.331s">We</a> need to build up their self-esteem. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5524.072s">I</a> have issues with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5525.552s">We</a> all know that, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5526.953s">I</a> don't think they're perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5528.514s">But</a> I will tell you that if you want a better police force, you have to train them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5533.816s">You</a> have to give them respect, and you have to train them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5536.257s">And</a> as far as the overtimes, yeah, you have to do overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5541.039s">But</a> as far as those details, we are all culpable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5544.76s">Every</a> last one of us are culpable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5546.821s">We</a> make a kickback. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5548.658s">We</a> make this salary, they don't make a good base salary in this city, but where they make their money is on those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5555.6s">And</a> we don't have to pay it out, so we are happy, because then we get another little cupcake someplace else from not paying them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5563.905s">And</a> we get a kickback, which makes it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5566.307s">We</a> get, not only do we rent out our cops to agencies like National Grid, that's what we're doing, we're renting them out for pay, and then we get money for renting them out on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5577.593s">So</a> not only do they pay us, pay our officers their actual real pay, their really hefty pay, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5586.374s">We</a> also get a kickback. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5587.535s">We</a> get 15% on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5589.157s">We</a> need to get rid of that 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5590.558s">And</a> that's something you guys can vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5592.3s">Of</a> course, you're not going to because it's not politically to your advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5597.164s">You'll</a> have to

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5322.928s">Thank</a> you, Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5325.509s">Thank</a> you for letting me speak and announce this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5329.49s">There</a> will be a breakfast on November 11th at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5334.391s">at</a> the First Baptist Church, 29 Oakland Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5339.093s">And</a> let me just tell you a little bit briefly about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5342.874s">The</a> church bell tower was first dedicated to 13 men and one woman who died in World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5348.383s">from</a> the congregation of the First Baptist Church in 1948. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5351.485s">The</a> bells have been recently refurbished, and the congregation would like to once again honor veterans with the patriotic music from these bells. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5361.269s">A</a> short performance of this music will occur as veterans congregate on the steps of the church at 9 AM, followed by an honorary breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5368.973s">Please</a> join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5370.434s">That's</a> right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5372.713s">There's</a> no reason why everybody can't be there, veterans and their families, and especially any widows or spouses, family members, because kids suffer too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5385.884s">Especially</a> with this generation, I hear a lot of kids that have to move from place to place and change school to change school when their fathers and mothers are in the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5395.842s">If</a> you're a child of a veteran, please come too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5400.245s">And</a> then the DAV 5K, if you don't mind, it's a run to honor veterans and you can go to DAV5K.org and you can find out all about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5410.711s">One</a> of the things that they want to stress is if you have a track team in your high school, so Medford High, get the track team involved, go to DAV5K.org and get signed up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5422.437s">If</a> you can't run, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5424.164s">Like</a> me, I'm going to volunteer, but you can sponsor somebody with money to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5429.65s">And</a> it's going to be advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5430.711s">There's</a> going to be an RKO spot the whole day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5434.695s">There's</a> a lot of money being poured into the city for it and everything, so you'll hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5439.02s">But</a> just so that you can sign up early, it's the DAV 5K. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5443.645s">It's</a> going to be at Castle Island in South Boston.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5448.61s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5449.931s">Yes,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5451.091s">That's</a> November 11th at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5453.812s">And</a> I know that they're going to have something at the VFW at 11 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5457.834s">So</a> you can go, you can hop from one to the other.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13200.397s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and you saved the best for last. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13205.198s">Our</a> emergency workers are so much more to us today than they were prior to September 11, 2001, and we as a city need to recognize them as the exceptional people they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13218.181s">Their</a> sacrifice has not been recognized by the city in deed or material. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13224.063s">This</a> needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13225.862s">Starting</a> with September 11, 2001, 411 emergency workers were killed trying to save the lives of those in the Trade Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13235.888s">This</a> included 343 firefighters, of whom two were paramedics. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13242.291s">Of</a> those who were killed, seven firefighters were black men. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13246.093s">And</a> yes, this needs to be pointed out, race matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13250.096s">Thirty-seven</a> police officers of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13255.637s">23</a> police officers of the New York Police Department, and eight emergency medical technicians in private emergency medical services. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13264.564s">Of</a> all police officers killed on September 11, 2001, 11 were women. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13270.908s">And</a> of those women, four women were of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13275.111s">Yes,</a> this needs to be pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13277.293s">Yes,</a> gender matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13279.555s">Also</a> of note, 12 police officers were men of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13284.118s">The</a> National Guard, whose job it once was to defend the homeland, are now being deployed to the current wars in Iraq and Syria through Operation Inherent Resolve, and in Afghanistan through Operation Freedom Sentinel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13298.842s">Using</a> the National Guard more as the reserves in regular army has forced our police departments to become literally the front line of our national defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13309.964s">They</a> have been used to stop terrorists in their tracks <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13313.045s">whether</a> it be Little Rock, Arkansas in June 2009 at a recruiting station where one soldier was killed and another wounded, or whether it was Fort Hood where 13 soldiers were killed and 31 others were wounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13327.497s">By</a> the way, the cop who stopped the rampage was a female and took a bullet to her hand from the shooter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13334.863s">Or</a> April 15, 2013, a day Boston will never forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13339.897s">Or</a> whether it be July 16, 2015, in San Bernardino, where 14 people were killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13349.625s">Or</a> Orlando, on June 12, 2016, where 49 were killed and 53 were wounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13357.531s">Or</a> this weekend, in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, where 29 people were injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13363.776s">The</a> first called to the scene are our police personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13367.788s">and</a> they literally put their lives on the line for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13370.81s">And</a> we need to recognize them for their new role and appreciate them for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13375.993s">The</a> fire department has played the first responder role as the medical team, very much the way the Army medic traditionally has during a battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13386.18s">They</a> are the triage unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13388.921s">They</a> are saving lives by being on the front line during an active mass event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13393.604s">I</a> would also include EMS workers with these two groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13397.89s">They</a> are under-respected for their service and sacrifice by this city in policy and material. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13404.514s">While</a> there are many ways to thank you, one is with a statue or a monument. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13411.628s">I'm</a> gonna suggest the statue of my dreams, but I know we don't have the money for it, but I'm gonna, then I'll tell you what I really want. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13419.614s">But</a> if I had my druthers, I would, that's right, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13425.178s">If</a> I could, and indulge me in this, I would knock down the dance hall outside, I'd pay for it and knock it down, put a green grass area up there, and I would have life-size monuments of a police officer, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13439.428s">saluting</a> a flag with a flagpole standing nearby, and a firefighter doing the firefighter's carry of a civilian. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13448.272s">And</a> I think that would be cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13449.472s">And</a> I would put a park bench near there, and I would have that so that civilians can sit there and contemplate those that protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13457.755s">But</a> we don't have the money for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13459.156s">So</a> in lieu of that, I would settle for a large boulder with a brass plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13464.078s">But</a> it needs to be centered someplace very special. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13469.3s">It</a> needs to be in an area that's very well kept and a boulder with a brass plaque. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13475.404s">And</a> I know it costs money, but I don't care if we have to have a bake sale for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13479.767s">We</a> know that we're not going to do a whole lot of other things in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13484.59s">We</a> know, unfortunately, I don't see any building going to be put up for a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13490.294s">We</a> can talk about it, but we know that's not going to happen in the next two years, sadly enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13494.913s">So</a> it's a small token of I would love to see more training. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13499.616s">I</a> would love to see the detailed whole system gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13504.379s">I</a> would like to see a lot of things, and I'll talk about those later on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13506.961s">You</a> know you'll hear from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13508.402s">But</a> one thing that we could do, because I don't think that there's a plaque for the police and for the fire in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13516.468s">And</a> I've seen them in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13518.449s">I</a> saw one in Plymouth, Mass, and it was really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13522.672s">And</a> it was just along the walkway, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13525.069s">It</a> was in a special place along the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13527.35s">And</a> it was a place that was, it has to be a very nice place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13530.67s">If</a> you're only going to give them a boulder with a brass plaque, don't put it in between two parked cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13537.692s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13538.852s">It</a> has to be in a very special place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13540.492s">And</a> so that's what I would recommend to whoever the people are in charge of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13545.073s">And</a> it's not asking too much, because our police and our fire are taking it on the chin. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13553.078s">We</a> need to prepare them for mass events, because they are literally the front line. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13557.46s">The</a> National Guard has been depleted, and they're overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13560.742s">So</a> when you call for help, the people coming are going to be the police and the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13565.445s">So</a> I just want to point that out, and hopefully we can get them some kind of recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13571.508s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc/2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 28,

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7658.5s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7659.321s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7660.501s">And</a> I was going to keep my mouth shut. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7661.722s">I</a> really was. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7664.204s">The</a> council does vote, and they don't always agree either, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7668.507s">They</a> have a two to five split vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7671.329s">They</a> can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7672.169s">That's</a> their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7673.771s">I</a> do respect the councilors who vote in the minority who explain why they vote in the minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7683.617s">But</a> it is their right to vote into the minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7686.619s">And</a> that's their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7687.902s">And</a> it's the same way with the Supreme Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7690.184s">They</a> have split votes, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7692.085s">So</a> I understand that you want to go in with the United Front, but it's not obligated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7698.951s">They're</a> not obligated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7699.811s">They</a> can have a minority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7701.853s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7705.075s">And</a> you will be respected more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7707.912s">if</a> you explain why, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7710.613s">Because</a> those that explain why they vote in the minority, when I'm at home, or actually not home, I'm here all the time, but when I listen to it, I have respect for that person because they gave me the explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7721.936s">So</a> I just wanted to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7723.396s">And</a> it's, but, so, well, just to add to that, you don't have to put pressure on the people that voted in the minority <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7736.725s">If</a> that's their choice, they don't have to explain it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7740.408s">That's</a> their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7741.249s">But</a> they will be perceived as having an ulterior motive if they don't explain it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g/2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 14, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3187.323s">Gene</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3190.787s">First</a> of all, thank you for letting me speak tonight without Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3194.772s">Cohen</a> and Mr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3196.875s">We</a> wouldn't be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3198.487s">able</a> to speak at an open meeting like this, so I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3202.369s">Normally,</a> I speak for myself, so the weight of what I say doesn't carry a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3207.672s">But</a> today, I have been asked by many of the abutters to speak for them, because they are just regular people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3214.416s">And</a> they don't get up here, and they're not public speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3218.198s">And</a> so they've asked me to speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3220.58s">So</a> I'm very nervous, because it's an awesome responsibility that I have to speak for these folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3228.231s">I</a> hope that after I speak, they'll feel more comfortable coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3234.254s">With</a> that, let me introduce you to the people of Cumming Street, the small scale residential neighborhood that the developers called these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3249.912s">This</a> is them, and they're all along Riverside Avenue, but most of them are for Cumming Street, but they're all along Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3256.476s">Meet</a> my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3257.736s">They're</a> all over here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3259.658s">So</a> these are people, and this is wonderful that they've come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3263.28s">Just</a> their presence here, they don't come out here every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3266.181s">They</a> got jobs and lives, not like me, but you know, they have jobs and lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3272.004s">They</a> can't be here every day advocating for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3274.546s">They</a> don't know what's going on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3277.003s">And</a> so it's important that they're here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3280.309s">And</a> so their presence should speak volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3283.434s">We</a> also have literally direct abutters to the Shaw's project tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3290.164s">literally,</a> without question, literally direct abutters here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3295.851s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3296.512s">So</a> I want that to be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3298.534s">And</a> I thank Mr. Marks and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3301.718s">Cohen</a> for bringing this to everybody's awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3305.743s">And</a> I think that it's very interesting that today they approved <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3311.0s">this</a> appeals thing, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3313.161s">This</a> is a complex situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3316.502s">And</a> most of these people, this is over their heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3318.942s">You</a> have to be a lawyer to figure this out, and land lawyers, and this and that, and the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3323.524s">All</a> they know is that this project's too big for their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3326.125s">That's</a> what they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3327.665s">They</a> know it's too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3328.926s">They</a> don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3329.486s">No</a> offense, city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3331.346s">They</a> don't know that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3333.127s">This</a> is intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3334.267s">This</a> process is intimidating for regular people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3337.108s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3340.325s">I</a> think they passed it so that the suits didn't have to sit here and look at the people tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3344.647s">That's</a> what I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3345.888s">I</a> think they passed it today so that the suits didn't have to show up from New York, Park Street, or whatever that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3351.71s">And</a> if they didn't do this in the dark of night, we wouldn't be here, and it wouldn't cost the city a dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3358.794s">You're</a> talking about $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3360.895s">Well,</a> if this was done right in the first place, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3365.128s">We</a> wouldn't have to pay a dime to a lawyer if they had asked for the city's, for the neighborhood's input ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3371.631s">This</a> is what happens when you try to slip something under in the dark of night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3375.352s">This</a> is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3376.333s">Let's</a> get this passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3377.793s">11</a> different violations of code violations or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3382.275s">If</a> they had asked for this, and yes, maybe if they had asked, maybe three people would have shown up, you know, but you don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3389.623s">We</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3390.704s">Maybe</a> there would have been 20 people that showed up, maybe 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3395.007s">But</a> now look at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3395.968s">Where</a> we are, we shouldn't have to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3398.59s">We</a> should not have to be doing this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3400.772s">This</a> is because it wasn't done right in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3403.834s">And</a> we have 20 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3413.526s">The</a> other big thing is that we have only 20 days to do something about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3417.509s">So</a> when you talk about getting counsel, I don't care what you have to do, but we have to do it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3422.572s">We</a> have to do it 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3424.514s">I</a> want you to work with these folks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3426.655s">I</a> want you to get the director butters, get their names, get them on paper because they don't, they've asked me to speak for them and I don't know how to speak for them, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3435.041s">I</a> want them to speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3438.22s">They're</a> intimidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3439.241s">This</a> is a very, very arduous process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3441.722s">You</a> guys do this every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3443.103s">This</a> is what you do for a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3444.304s">This</a> is what you get paid to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3446.024s">They</a> don't do this every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3447.585s">They're</a> not up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3448.206s">They</a> don't know you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3448.806s">They</a> don't know the routine every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3450.867s">So</a> this is important that you get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3454.129s">And</a> just because something's hard does not mean it shouldn't be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3460.652s">So</a> when you say, we have to have this done and we have to have that done, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3465.737s">Don't,</a> no offense, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3468.237s">He</a> knows me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3469.178s">But</a> just because it's hard doesn't mean we shouldn't go forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3474.819s">So</a> don't say that just because, you know, well, we might have to this, that, and the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3479.299s">But</a> I do like what he said about coming up with the reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3482.16s">The</a> solicitor said we do need to have reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3484.78s">We</a> shouldn't have had to come, we shouldn't be here where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3488.621s">But</a> we do need to come up with those reasons now because the horse is out of the barn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3493.882s">The</a> horse is out of the barn now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3496.105s">It</a> shouldn't have been that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3497.026s">It</a> should have been that the horse should have stayed in the barn, and we would have been fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3501.068s">You</a> wouldn't see these people here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3502.749s">They</a> don't want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3503.989s">I</a> want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3504.75s">I</a> love coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3505.55s">This</a> is my thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3506.791s">But</a> these people, they don't want to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3509.352s">This</a> is not their normal Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3511.773s">They</a> have people to take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3513.094s">They</a> have things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3515.095s">And</a> so I just want you to recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3519.993s">I</a> hope that they can speak for themselves now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=3522.334s">I</a> hope that I've given them that much

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1591.796s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1593.297s">And</a> so I'm a direct abutter to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1595.298s">So</a> thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1598.039s">I</a> went to the meeting last week, and the residents, first of all, I want to humanize the residents in that small scale residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1606.45s">that</a> abuts this project, that's how they referred to us, the small-scale residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1613.253s">That's</a> what Cumming Street was. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1618.335s">Four</a> of the direct abutters down the street were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1621.076s">They're</a> all women, all senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1626.139s">Two</a> of them have been in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1628.099s">They</a> were second mothers to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1629.96s">I</a> take one of them to their doctor's appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1632.081s">I</a> just want you to know that these people that directly abut this property, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1636.707s">You</a> may have opinions on me, that's fine, but they all showed up, these four women at the bottom of the street, all senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1643.31s">They're</a> intimidated to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1645.431s">One</a> of them didn't speak at all because she just, the process just intimidates her. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1651.214s">So</a> I'm going to try to get them to come down to this open meeting next week if we can, so that they can have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1656.477s">We</a> had each three minutes a piece to speak on the issue and that wasn't enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1661.879s">This</a> is 490 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1664.684s">It's</a> too big of a scale of a project in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1668.267s">I'm</a> having a not in my backyard moment here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1671.028s">This</a> is directly in my backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1673.71s">And</a> they designed it so that they could maximize the lot to put the most units in to get the most money out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1684.338s">It's</a> clear because they go all the way to the boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1686.539s">They</a> said that they were going to put in retail space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1688.701s">They</a> said that they were going to have 7,000 square feet or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1692.91s">And</a> they are going to keep my bank, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1694.932s">I</a> go to Eastern Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1695.913s">They're</a> going to keep the bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1697.914s">But</a> outside of that, they're going to have one or two more stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1700.517s">It's</a> not going to be completely storefronts on the bottom and then condos on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1705.521s">That</a> would benefit me as a neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1708.203s">I</a> wouldn't have as much of a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1710.245s">Put</a> in a CVS or a Rite Aid or something that can be used by everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1713.728s">Put</a> in a coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1714.769s">That</a> would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1717.685s">maybe</a> 150 to 200 condos above it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1720.888s">I</a> know that that's gonna blow their minds and that it impacts their bottom line, but they are business people, they are developers, and they're looking out for themselves and their bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1732.559s">It's</a> up to the zoning board to look out for us, the people of Medford that are here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1737.544s">This</a> is just too large of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1740.683s">Now,</a> if you put in 200 units, maybe it... I don't mind businesses on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1747.145s">I've</a> lived on Cumming Street all my life, and I have no problem with the businesses that are on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1753.367s">Businesses</a> don't bother me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1754.567s">They</a> bring in money to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1756.708s">If</a> they want to use it for business, please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1759.069s">I</a> mean commercial business. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1760.669s">I</a> have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1761.749s">I've</a> lived with it all my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1763.31s">They</a> bring in income for the city, and there's not as much traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1767.411s">But</a> that aside, if you're going to put in <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1770.262s">condos,</a> please make the whole bottom floor retail spaces and make it friendly for us to walk in and walk through. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1778.424s">They</a> want to keep the entrance to Cumming Street open to this project, and that's because they are going to have pedestrians and they are going to have bicyclists that need a safe road to go up to Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1790.988s">And</a> we are very convenient for them to go up to Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1794.509s">So</a> if I wanted to, I could talk to my residents, my people, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1798.527s">and</a> have them block it off with a fence, because it's legally their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1802.069s">And</a> they could fence it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1803.849s">We</a> could gate that off if we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1805.35s">I</a> don't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1806.63s">We</a> actually fought when, not Shaw's, but the Star Market went in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1811.472s">And</a> we fought to keep that pedestrian walkthrough so that it would benefit us to get to Shaw's, to get to the Star Market. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1818.415s">I</a> don't want to block it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1819.716s">But</a> if they're going to block us off, why not block them off, just to not be nice neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1825.278s">If</a> they're not going to be nice neighbors, why should we? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1829.309s">And</a> so that's a lousy way to look at it, but that's how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1833.392s">I</a> feel like this is being rammed through, rammed down my throat, and I'm going to be living with the consequences on Riverside Ave and Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1841.818s">The</a> traffic is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1843.399s">As</a> it is, they should take out a couple of the businesses on Riverside Ave just so the buses and the trucks can get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1849.783s">That</a> is a trucking zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1851.584s">Trucks</a> and buses go down Locust Street from Riverside Ave, and they can hardly make that corner now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1857.309s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1857.689s">So</a> when you have all those cars, it's going to be backed up to, to, to, and wait until the casino comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1863.374s">It's</a> just going to get really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1865.055s">But,</a> but, but that aside, that's casinos, you know, we, you don't have any say over the casino, but you do over this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1872.642s">And</a> I want you to scale down this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1875.104s">I</a> want the powers that be listen, these women that live down the street have been there for all their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1883.15s">They</a> cook for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1883.811s">I</a> cut their grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1884.491s">They</a> cook for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1885.072s">I</a> love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1887.05s">They</a> are people. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1889.493s">They</a> are people and they're not a small-scale residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1893.758s">I</a> mean, you can have arguments with me all day long, but you can't argue with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1898.384s">They've</a> been in this city forever and they deserve to be respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1902.649s">They</a> came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1904.249s">without</a> my prompting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1905.769s">They</a> got the letters, and they came out without my prompting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1908.77s">Now</a> I'm going to let them know so that they can come down to speak and hopefully talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1914.672s">But</a> remember, these are old school people, and they're very intimidated by the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1919.713s">And</a> they're intimidated, and they might not speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1921.654s">They</a> might be here, but they might not have the gumption to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1924.555s">So</a> I hope their presence alone makes a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1928.116s">So</a> thank you very much for listening.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10155.87s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10157.39s">And</a> I do appreciate Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10158.81s">Hunt</a> and all the work that she does. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10161.151s">And</a> if I can, if they make it affordable, I'll put solar panels on my roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10166.372s">I'd</a> be the first one to talk to her if I was going to put solar panels on my roof or do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10172.794s">But</a> the government is in my life too much as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10175.995s">Believe</a> me, they're in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10177.956s">And</a> the CPA has required me now <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10183.883s">I</a> had to go and get the exemption for low income, and I had to present my birth certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10188.904s">I</a> had to present my tax return. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10190.824s">I</a> had to present, which I never had to do, just for this one little thing in the city, just for this one little thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10196.766s">I</a> had my tax return. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10198.646s">I</a> had to put in—I get rental income. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10201.527s">They</a> never had to know what my rental income was. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10204.027s">Not</a> that I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10205.227s">I</a> don't overcharge my tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10206.708s">In</a> fact, I undercharge him. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10208.268s">That's</a> not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10209.483s">It's</a> nobody's business if I charge them $1,200 or $2,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10213.046s">It</a> shouldn't be their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10214.327s">But</a> it is now because for the first time, I have to give this information out to the city just for my taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10224.834s">And</a> I mean, everybody knows everything about my economic status. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10228.437s">I</a> mean, it's not news. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10229.858s">But</a> it's an invasion of privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10232.08s">And</a> back to the city and how they do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10234.362s">The</a> water and sewer business is what you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10237.813s">which</a> is a commodity or it's a mandated thing, the water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10243.599s">And</a> look at the situation that the city is in with water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10248.363s">And</a> that is a, and I'm not against the saving money and the electricity and all of that, but we don't need one more layer of bureaucracy in this city for the reasons that Mr. Caraviello pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10261.268s">And,</a> um, the water and sewer pipes need replacement and we can't demand from the government that they get replaced under the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10271.271s">We</a> can't, we can't get them to move on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10273.352s">We</a> can't get the city government to run properly now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10277.345s">whether</a> it's a fire department, police department, there's a lot of areas that are insufficient in the city government now, especially water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10284.852s">And</a> it's comparable to what this issue is, which is electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10289.984s">which</a> is something you need in your house right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10293.405s">And</a> I'm all for, if I can afford to put solar panels on my house and go, you know, renewable, all the more power to me, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10301.849s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10302.729s">There's</a> other also complexities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10305.19s">At</a> one point, I needed National Grid to give me a cut in my electric bill because my income was low. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10312.454s">before</a> I got my disability check. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10315.916s">So</a> I needed that extra money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10317.678s">So</a> that was another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10318.538s">I</a> had to go to the National Grid and I got a break in my electric bill when I had a very, very low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10324.042s">So</a> would I be able to negotiate that with the new provider or whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10330.306s">It's</a> just too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10332.531s">So</a> it's just one more layer of the local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10337.232s">And</a> again, I want her to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10339.753s">I</a> want her to save money for the city and put up solar panels and wind farms if it's doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10345.534s">In</a> fact, the wind farms should be going towards putting this city electric bill on wind farms and on solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10352.776s">More</a> power to her if she can figure out a way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10355.6s">That's</a> what she should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10357.72s">And</a> so I just think that there's enough government in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10363.482s">Trust</a> me on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10365.242s">I</a> live inside the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10366.342s">The</a> government lives inside my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10368.142s">So</a> we get enough of that going. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10370.383s">So</a> anyway, thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10371.623s">Bye-bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10374.524s">Name</a> and address.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI/2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 24, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2284.958s">Thank</a> you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2287.119s">And</a> this is a very, very sober topic and we should discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2291.242s">We</a> should discuss it a lot, but we also should have action on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2294.664s">And</a> I would definitely hope, not hope, expect that the mayor turns this into a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2302.148s">Whether</a> it's the police building itself, whether it's to tear down the old one and put up a new one, whether it's to put a <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2309.107s">second</a> floor or third floor on the existing structure, whatever it takes that's acceptable to the police department themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2316.693s">The</a> morale of the police department in the city has got to be terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2320.235s">I</a> know I get mixed reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2321.356s">I'm</a> sure they love and hate me at different times, and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2324.318s">They're</a> allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2326.56s">But</a> we don't have enough police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2329.962s">And</a> a few factors is that, first of all, we pay them through details. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2335.787s">And</a> that structure, we're not paying them what they're worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2339.435s">And</a> number two, we get a kickback from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2341.116s">So</a> we don't want to give up the details because the city gets a 15 percent kickback on every hour that an officer works. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2347.66s">That</a> system is archaic and it needs to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2350.741s">We</a> need to free them up for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2352.703s">And</a> when I mean training, I mean they need to be doing exercises on sweeping buildings, which also brings us into the school department issues, because there's no building that's better to sweep than the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2363.469s">But</a> if the high school is being sold on the weekends to private entities, then we can't use it for exercising. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2370.016s">for</a> exercises for the cops to sweep a building or to practice for an emergency situation, whether it's the fire department or the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2379.118s">This</a> has to become an absolute priority for this new mayor, and I'm going to expect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2386.299s">There's</a> nothing more important than the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2389.04s">And</a> like I said, and the other factor is a lot of police officers, I'm doing Memorial Day at the Oak Grove Cemetery, and I'm focusing on police officers that were veterans who became police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2399.21s">and</a> police officers who belong to the National Guard and Reserves who have died in action, whether overseas or on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2407.495s">I'm</a> going to be focused on that this Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2410.536s">We</a> have police officers that might get pulled away from their duties as a Medford police officer to go into the National Guard and Reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2421.322s">We</a> need to also have more officers available for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2426.641s">If</a> we're down to 104, then we don't have enough officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2430.804s">And</a> we need to have 130 recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2433.626s">This</a> is a city that's huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2435.407s">It's</a> a very compact, small city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2437.729s">And</a> if we don't do something about it, it will be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2440.971s">There</a> is a point at which it becomes too late to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2444.573s">And</a> a crisis will ensue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2445.974s">Then</a> you will have an overreaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2448.476s">But</a> if you plan it out, then you can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2451.518s">And</a> also, practicing the traffic calming measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2456.112s">are</a> absolutely essential for the police, because it'll cut down on the speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2461.074s">It</a> will absolutely cut down on the speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2462.915s">And</a> wait until the 490 units goes into Locust Street, and wait until Wegmans comes into Locust Street, wait until Riverside Ave becomes, you know, absolute gridlock. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2475.161s">Wait</a> until all of this stuff happens, what are you gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2477.142s">You</a> can't expect people to do more than what they're capable of doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2482.324s">And</a> while I criticize the police at times, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2485.036s">I'm</a> more their advocate than not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2488.48s">I</a> don't see too many people up here over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2492.225s">I'm</a> grateful that that woman spoke today, Ann, because they need an advocate in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2499.194s">And</a> I know that you guys say that you want the police building and you want police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2503.967s">Do</a> something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2505.208s">Make</a> your voices heard loud and clear that this is a priority in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2510.033s">And</a> until, because you know when they want money for parks, they find it, no offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2514.136s">When</a> they want money for certain things, they find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2517.239s">But</a> the city as a whole doesn't appreciate the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2521.383s">And</a> they need to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2522.684s">And</a> they will when the crime goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2525.066s">When</a> it affects them in their backyard, believe me, the citizens will be in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2529.927s">And</a> by then it'll be too late because you'll have a lot of angry men and women in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2534.588s">And</a> they'll be saying, I want this and I want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2537.209s">And</a> where's the money going to come from then? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2539.11s">They'll</a> find it, but it's going to cost on some other level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2542.591s">Some</a> other service in the city is going to have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2545.452s">It's</a> going to have to take the hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2548.172s">And</a> so thank you very much for listening.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4796.816s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4797.196s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I agree with you that this is a wonderful idea, and I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4804.639s">Bring</a> the show on the road, and bring it to the neighborhoods, and <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4808.771s">You</a> know, you'll get more participation, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4811.392s">Hopefully.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4812.093s">Some</a> neighborhoods you still won't get a response, trust me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4814.874s">But</a> you can always try. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4817.736s">And</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4818.856s">But</a> my point is, is that we're asking for the police to come out again and do something for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4824.76s">What</a> are we going to do for the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4825.9s">And</a> I'm not pointing fingers at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4827.581s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4828.061s">I'm</a> saying as a body, what are we doing for the police to motivate them? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4834.845s">Because</a> we keep asking for them to do <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4837.323s">you</a> know, patrols and community organizing and community policing and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4843.465s">But</a> like Mr. Pender said, if the place that you guys can show your voice is not to approve the budget unless there's more money for the police department, whether it be for the police building, whether it be for more police officers, then that's when we can show that we're willing, even if it's two officers, it doesn't have to be 20 all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4865.868s">And</a> things like cruises should be on a regular budget anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4868.849s">We</a> should get two new cruises every year no matter what because they're always on the road and they're always working. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4873.991s">You</a> know, what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4875.452s">But</a> cruises are small potatoes because we really do need personnel and we need a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4880.034s">So</a> what are we doing for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4882.014s">Because</a> again, we keep asking of them, but I don't see the hand going back to the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4888.797s">And</a> I'm not pointing to you because I think it's a great idea.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4891.918s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4892.599s">I</a> think it's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4893.953s">but</a> I just wanted to make that note.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4949.178s">And</a> I'm going to ask the public, what are we willing to sacrifice to have these new police officers? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4954.86s">Because</a> it's going to have to come out of some fund someplace, whether it's the bubble or the skate rink or a park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4961.781s">What</a> are we willing to sacrifice to have this happen, unfortunately? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4966.423s">And</a> there are certain things that shouldn't be questioned, like we need another teacher for English. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4971.344s">I</a> heard we had a shortage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4973.064s">So</a> that shouldn't be on the docket. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4974.885s">But</a> there are other places where we can come up with funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4977.507s">for</a> two officers for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4979.468s">It's</a> not a big ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4980.909s">I</a> don't think it's a big ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4982.81s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2pAQFYhyG5g/2025-03-21_2pAQFYhyG5g.html">Medford, MA School Committee - May 16, 2016 [Incomplete] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5291.135s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 coming street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5292.355s">Thank</a> you very much for having me and letting me speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5294.936s">Um,</a> I'm going to ask you guys first to, to not be defensive, you know, um, and it's, it's hard not to get defensive because you feel like you're being undermined and you know, your authority is being undermined. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5307.061s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5309.535s">It's</a> an overarching concept that with the new mayor, the old mayor did things very, very differently and things were around for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5317.802s">And</a> people just went on automatic pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5320.252s">And</a> this is the first time that questions are being asked of leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5325.895s">And</a> with Mayor Burke, they're actually not getting pushed under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5330.657s">So</a> that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5332.158s">So</a> the dialogue between the council and the mayor needs to improve, as I pointed out to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5338.861s">And</a> the people need to dialogue with the school committee more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5345.024s">And</a> there's nothing wrong with challenging the leadership, challenging authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5349.466s">There's</a> nothing wrong with asking questions, and I thank her for asking that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5353.928s">One</a> of the reasons why it got overlapped is because the people weren't feeling that they weren't getting their answers from this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5361.87s">And</a> that's why they went to the council, and that's why I pointed out they're calling the Councilors, because they don't feel that their needs are being heard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5370.748s">So</a> there's a breakdown in communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5372.629s">So</a> that needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5374.25s">And</a> I just wanted to say that whether he stays or goes, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5377.551s">I</a> don't have children in the school system, no offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5379.892s">But</a> I do know that you've been around long enough not to take anything I say personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5383.474s">I</a> do know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5386.115s">He</a> knows me too well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5387.315s">But</a> anyway, I just want the process to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5391.057s">It's</a> the same thing with the charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5392.257s">It's</a> the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5393.058s">And</a> there is overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5394.018s">I</a> don't have children in the school systems, but I do have a tenant who has a daughter in the school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5399.142s">So</a> you're always around kids, and kids are always everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5401.923s">They're</a> always everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5403.043s">And</a> so a kid in the school system is my kid in an extended version. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5409.265s">But</a> what was I going to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5413.186s">I</a> did, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5414.666s">I</a> just think that more communication and more openness, it's not a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5419.948s">The</a> new mayor has a new start. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5421.848s">She's</a> got a long way to go, a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5425.111s">And</a> it's not bad to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5428.072s">Oh,</a> and the overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5429.873s">If</a> you have the TV3, and I don't agree with having it up at the high school, you all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5433.674s">But</a> if you do, I'm a person, I'm a citizen, I'm now going to be in that public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5437.416s">I'm</a> going to be in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5439.697s">There</a> is overlap between, even if you don't have kids in the system, there's an overlap between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5445.545s">and</a> the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5446.845s">And</a> that, oh, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5447.966s">I</a> just want to say, Jean, you're a taxpayer.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5451.007s">That's</a> right.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5464.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5465.151s">So</a> I just wanted to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5467.897s">There's</a> nothing wrong with asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5469.739s">And</a> I think that every five years, somebody should be judging you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5472.382s">No</a> offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5472.802s">Every</a> year.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5475.425s">But</a> it should come from some higher authority and not yourself.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5479.55s">Oh,</a> you hire him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.13s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.611s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.931s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5481.292s">Yeah,</a> but he's evaluating himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5482.533s">I</a> don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5483.114s">He</a> should. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5483.674s">He</a> submits it to the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5487.258s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5487.498s">OK.</a>

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4359.025s">Thank</a> you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4360.586s">And</a> I'm sorry, Indy, that was my bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4362.527s">I</a> didn't know you were sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4364.483s">This</a> could be an energizing battery for the city, for the business community, for the schools, for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4370.006s">But</a> I wanted to break down some of the money issues involved because not everybody wants to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4375.649s">For</a> every $100 that I pay in my cable bill, whether it be Verizon or Comcast, $5 gets taken off the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4382.572s">The</a> deal that the mayor made in 1988 or whatever it was, was that out of that $5, $3 goes to the general fund of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4392.197s">Now,</a> I was hired on the arts community last week <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4394.72s">But</a> if they were to seek that money from the general fund back into the arts community for AXS TV, then I would be a proponent of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4404.843s">That's</a> not what the city wants to hear, but I would be a proponent of having that money go back to what it's supposed to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4410.264s">Because</a> when you tell me that Somerville hires nine people, they have to be using all 5% of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4417.586s">And</a> so we only receive 2% for our peg, which is public, education, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4424.058s">and</a> government access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4425.9s">And</a> 1% is used for, only 1% is used for the public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4434.126s">The</a> other 1% is split in half, the government channel slash high school channel or education channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4442.593s">And</a> so people need to be aware that there is more money in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4445.676s">We're</a> paying that out of our cable bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4447.757s">It's</a> not coming out of the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4449.399s">So</a> it's not the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4451.632s">It's</a> the rate payers' money, but it goes to the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4456.094s">So</a> there's a little bit of a mix up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4458.374s">I</a> know it's hard for people at home to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4461.396s">It</a> took me a while to figure it out myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4463.296s">So</a> I just wanted to clarify that that's where the money comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4465.977s">And</a> I want to know, if I could ask through the chair, is the theater has a cable drop? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4474.08s">It</a> has the ability, the theater, our Chevalier Theater currently has the ability <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4479.807s">to</a> have a station in that building, it's cable ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4484.168s">So</a> if it's just because of the Boys and Girls Club, if we move the Boys and Girls Club out of the basement, we could automatically, without even renting a new space, just put the station in the basement of the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4497.15s">Because</a> otherwise it's a cumbersome process to go through the square, find a spot, and it would take longer to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4504.291s">We</a> could do that in the future or whatever, but if you wanted to have it done today, they're cable ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4509.675s">The</a> man that's in charge over there, he said that they had a cable drop, so it's cable ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4514.878s">So</a> thank you very much for letting me speak.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6205.327s">Hi,</a> Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6207.887s">So</a> much for transparency, right?
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6301.721s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6303.122s">To</a> answer Mr. Knight's point through the chair, that was the old administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6308.046s">And</a> yes, you're absolutely correct that under the old administration, he decided that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6312.93s">But</a> anyway, one of the problems that I see is that the high school <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6318.002s">There's</a> many, many problems with the high school, public safety being one of them, of having strange adults wandering those halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6324.827s">Also,</a> senior citizens, and you're absolutely correct, Gwen, I've talked to 75-year-old ladies that say, if I got off the bus, I would never make it up that hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6332.773s">And</a> then when you make it up that hill, it's very dark, and it's just not a good place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6337.456s">What</a> is, who benefits from having it up there, unfortunately, and this is not going to be popular, is the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6343.78s">The</a> school system gets all those fundings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6345.862s">They</a> get that whole bucket of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6347.973s">to</a> put into their art system. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6350.254s">But</a> as far as feeling like it's a community center, it's a ghost town over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6356.176s">And</a> so it's not going to seem like it's a community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6361.457s">But</a> I do agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6362.497s">Somebody</a> pointed it out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6364.438s">Handicapped</a> accessibility and shame on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6367.539s">Shame</a> on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6368.099s">Because</a> I didn't think about that when I suggested the theater basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6371.92s">I</a> don't know if it would be wheelchair accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6374.361s">So</a> shame on me for not thinking that through before I suggested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6377.856s">But</a> it needs to go down the Method Square for everybody's benefit, for the community to feel like it's their thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6387.061s">Because</a> if they don't have kids in the high school, they're not going to feel, it's just not up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6391.824s">It's</a> just not a good spot for the hype. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6393.825s">So</a> I would recommend, oh, and one more point. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6397.347s">We</a> have an arts council in this city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6400.069s">So</a> they need to be involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6402.991s">And</a> we have the money right now to hire somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6407.513s">for</a> $500,000 to direct this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6410.294s">And</a> it doesn't have to come from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6412.175s">So</a> it doesn't show any bias of who they want to pick. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6415.837s">There's</a> an arts council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6417.238s">And</a> that's what they should be doing is focusing on hiring somebody so that they can oversee this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6422.82s">And</a> they could go to a Malden or Melrose or someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6425.402s">This</a> has been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6426.742s">We're</a> not reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6428.743s">We</a> already had that committee and that commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6431.384s">And</a> that went nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6432.665s">That</a> went into a drawer someplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6434.466s">So</a> we need to hire somebody to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6437.392s">And</a> we have plenty of money in that draw now. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6439.893s">And</a> the Arts Council needs to be on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6442.514s">Is</a> there or is there not an appointed Arts Council for the City of Medford through the Mayor's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6447.736s">There</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6448.636s">So</a> why not invoke them and get them to start this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6453.178s">Because</a> in any city that I see the community access, it's the arts community that does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6458.1s">It's</a> their ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6459.301s">It's</a> predominantly their ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6460.442s">They</a> invite everybody else to sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6463.144s">In</a> Everett, they have three cameras on every football game. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6465.886s">Three</a> cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6466.566s">They</a> are wicked into football over there, and they have three cameras over there for every football game. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6471.529s">Why</a> don't we have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6472.73s">And</a> we're missing out on all kinds of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6474.692s">So</a> I just wanted to thank you very much for listening to me rant on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6478.274s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UbuGDpkJhgM/2025-03-21_UbuGDpkJhgM.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=742.042s">Thank</a> you, Gene Martington, Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=744.163s">Thank</a> you for bringing this up, Mr. Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=745.904s">And</a> I would just like to add that this is, generally speaking, a nighttime activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=750.667s">So</a> we can beef up patrols in the business districts, usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=754.39s">Usually</a> it's mailboxes, signs, public or private store buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=760.894s">It's</a> usually not houses, generally speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=762.995s">So</a> we need to beef up security. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=764.216s">But</a> also, lighting can be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=766.753s">We</a> need to talk to the people that own these buildings, because if you add lighting to it, people are less likely to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=773.017s">And</a> again, if the area is clean, it's not as contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=777.039s">It</a> is a contagious activity, absolutely, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=780.081s">If</a> you see one beer bottle or one Pepsi can, you're likely to see another one and another one and another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=787.166s">Same</a> thing with graffiti or trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=789.407s">So</a> if we keep the area clean too, which is part of our responsibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=793.638s">That</a> would help, but also I think the arts community could be brought into this and we can work with those people and if the business is okay with some kind of mural, that would be good too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=804.082s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4556.033s">Hello,</a> Jean Martin, 10 coming street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4557.814s">And</a> I went to that same meeting that Mr. Caraviello went to on constituency, constituency services. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4563.558s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4564.426s">And</a> you're absolutely right, Mr. Marks, if you do not have more people in the areas that were most discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4572.17s">And</a> I kind of wonder, because now you've set up this expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4574.851s">These</a> people came out, and they didn't just come out from West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4577.992s">They</a> came out from all over the areas of Medford, and they came to this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4582.394s">And</a> now there's a belief system that things are going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4587.076s">And</a> I hope that things change, because now you've set up the expectation that things are going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4591.613s">And</a> the only way that they're going to change is if you hire more DPW workers and more police. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4595.935s">Because</a> the two biggest issues that came up were, one, parking enforcement, street sweeping, plowing, especially plowing in the winter, and all of the car issues and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4610.403s">And</a> also the DPW potholes and you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4614.405s">So</a> if we do not hire more DPW workers and more police or <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4619.636s">reutilize</a> our police so that they're in enforcement mode, then the 311 system is going to be absolutely useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4627.558s">It's</a> going to set up the expectation that I'm going to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4630.259s">And</a> then if they're not heard, they're going to be even more frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4633.06s">So</a> I just want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4634.781s">So</a> we're going to have to figure out something to do because there's not enough DPW workers to take care of the issues in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4642.923s">Clearly,</a> like you said, at the high school, they can't even salt the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=4647.004s">So</a> thank you very much.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4374.575s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4376.116s">And</a> I just wanted to—not on the positions, but on one point that the solicitor said that I was in <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4382.493s">a</a> definite disagreement with, all due respect, these people get paid a lot of money and they get paid to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4389.618s">When</a> I was a private in the Army, I was told point blank, you don't get paid to think, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4395.141s">And</a> I said, I think, Sergeant, and he said, private, you don't get paid to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4400.464s">But</a> anyway, these guys get a lot of money, a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4406.308s">They</a> get paid to think about the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4408.189s">They</a> get paid to think about what's going to happen in five years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4412.018s">So</a> with all due respect to the solicitor, it's not about the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4416.279s">I</a> don't, you guys wrangled that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4418.4s">The</a> point is, is that yeah, you guys are getting paid lots of money to think down the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4425.122s">And</a> that includes the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4426.303s">So</a> she needs to think what's going to happen in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4429.184s">So</a> that's all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4430.204s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4430.664s">And</a> with due respect to the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4433.985s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7901.459s">Hi,</a> Gene Martin, Municipal Lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7904.181s">But</a> anyway, this is, well, I'm going to be talking about two different little blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7910.463s">This</a> is a citywide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7911.724s">This</a> affects the Medford Square projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7915.886s">This</a> affects the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7918.427s">And</a> I just want everybody to know that all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7921.469s">department</a> heads need to be in and understand what I'm trying to get across. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7925.15s">Because</a> this is a citywide project, even though it's going to be talking about two small blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7931.231s">First</a> of all, reorganizing Union and Swan Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7935.171s">There</a> are two small blocks between the police headquarters and the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7939.652s">The</a> first block is between Union and Swan, which are more like alleys than streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7945.413s">And</a> I recommend anybody just drive down Mystic Ave and Main <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7950.281s">And</a> go up those, quote, streets, they're more like alleys than they are streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7956.162s">The</a> second block between Swan and James is a little bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7959.663s">These</a> two blocks, separating the police facility and the DPW yards, are small privately owned businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7966.684s">Along</a> Union Alley, and I call it alley, are the following, Alsar Automotive, Carly Fence, Stevens Auto, and Lew's Custom Exhaust. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7977.607s">Swan</a> Street, A&P, Collision Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7980.572s">After</a> that, a junkyard, complete eyesore, and then Eastern Tool Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7986.053s">If</a> you go down that road, if you look from above, and actually as you're going down it, there's a huge junk area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7994.074s">It</a> just looks like an eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7996.375s">On</a> the left is a marble and granite company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7998.535s">James</a> Street has all truck company. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8002.656s">Unfortunately,</a> the new public safety building is going to need at least the lots on Union to Swan Street to meet code. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8010.748s">for</a> the current footprint, which is one-third too small, and so union to Swan is not an option, but rather a mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8020.431s">Whether</a> or not we move the businesses on James Street is still optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8024.933s">Since</a> we are going to have to disturb that area, we might as well do it right to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8030.795s">It</a> makes sense to turn those two whole blocks, including James Street, into city-owned lots <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8037.775s">so</a> that we can increase our building space for other related departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8042.217s">We</a> need to work with these business owners and find them new lots for their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8047.22s">And</a> this is where you come in, Mr. Delarusso and Mr. Caraviello especially, because you're both on the rotary and you need to be, you know, pushing for this, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8057.226s">Not</a> only do I see the new police fire 911 facility staying where it is, but I see buildings that house other city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8066.538s">in</a> it like public health, building management, engineering, water and sewer, cemetery, any departments that seems compatible with police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8076.462s">The</a> other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view over the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8082.725s">Currently,</a> the view is ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8085.586s">So</a> seriously, if you put those fancy condos above the storefronts, you know, where CVS is and all of that, they're gonna have an awful view. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8095.783s">I'm</a> telling you, if you look down, do the aerial thing from, that's why I did this, aerial view, it's all junky, it's ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8104.17s">So</a> it'll increase your property values of the Medford Square project as well, not to look over the river and then to, you know, to see all that junky stuff, mostly automotive places. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8113.698s">And</a> I'm not saying get rid of them, I'm saying help us move them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8118.602s">One</a> other aspect of this change is that it will impact the new square's view on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8124.106s">Currently,</a> the view is ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8125.812s">As</a> soon as these businesses are, some of these businesses are dumpy and crappy looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8132.458s">So</a> if you are going to gentrify the square with condos above the storefronts, then you need to clean up that view for them anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8139.825s">The</a> losers appear to be the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8142.408s">However,</a> Carly Fence would do better on a front lot on Mystic Ave with a better eye-catching sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8150.541s">The</a> other businesses will have a harder time finding lots because they are automotive by nature and have a lot of grease and oil and stuff requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8163.464s">I</a> believe that the city would be short sighted not to consider the whole area between the police station and the DPW lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8171.276s">as</a> possible office and building structures for city business, leaving more room in city hall for new areas of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8179.158s">As</a> you know, the city is growing and it needs more space. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8182.379s">Um,</a> my point is, is that since this isn't going to happen tomorrow, we need to help plan with the five year vision of, you know, breaking ground at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8196.363s">And</a> if you do, you're going to have to do it where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8198.922s">because</a> it's centrally located, it's easy to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8201.885s">You</a> want police, fire, and 911 all in the same area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8205.009s">Clearly</a> the current building size is not big enough, the footprint is not big enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8209.534s">So</a> you're gonna have to take over that little alley anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8213.362s">So</a> since you're going to do that and you're going to disturb the area, you might as well do it all in one shot with the business community, with all the department heads, with everybody on board and visualize what you want it to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8225.911s">And</a> it'll serve as a, everybody will be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8229.853s">But</a> what I'm saying is if we just take, take it by eminent domain, you're going to cause a lot of trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8236.117s">So</a> if you, if I think that we all need to work with the business communities down there, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8240.17s">and</a> find them another home inside the city where these automotive, mostly automotive places, body shops and whatnot, can do their business along Mystic Ave or someplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8249.576s">There's</a> got to be someplace for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8251.277s">So</a> if you don't, you're going to have to take the ground anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8255.099s">And</a> it'll cause problems if it happens abruptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8258.041s">So</a> plan it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8259.221s">Thank</a> you.

are here with the government meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1968.486s">But</a> you'll see a diversity in thought and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1971.987s">But</a> you know, that's what the old mayor didn't want and he got away with it because he had friends at the statehouse and because he had friends everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1980.148s">This</a> new mayor has a new start. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1982.289s">She</a> can start fresh. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1984.029s">She</a> can start with the, you know, and if there are problems like in the past, which she is very aware of, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1991.771s">money</a> disappearing, attacks on personalities and characteristics, then we need to have a format by which to get rid of those people on the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2003.699s">And</a> it isn't rocket science because they're all doing it all around us and we're losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2009.463s">And</a> this affects the business community, Mr. Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2013.579s">This</a> affects the, well, I think of business, I think of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2017.0s">That's</a> why I voted for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2018.26s">Anyway,</a> and you better do something for the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2021.021s">So</a> anyway, I'm going to hold you to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2022.881s">But</a> anyway, you know, it helps the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2027.082s">It</a> helps the arts community, the theater, the theater, the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2032.123s">It</a> helps everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2033.783s">And</a> it is a waste of time and money to put it in this Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2037.504s">Not</a> that I'm against having them be taught those skill sets at the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2041.765s">But</a> it puts more money in the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2044.233s">Unfortunately,</a> and I have to go through this laundry list, all new schools 10 years ago, a new pool, two new stadiums, all money going towards the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2054.635s">I'm</a> not against the students, but the students and the schools have gotten the lion's share of all the monies, and now they have another part to play with, which is this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2064.437s">They</a> got the tech bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2065.637s">That</a> was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2066.718s">They've</a> gotten a chunk of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2067.818s">The</a> only thing on the city side has been a $14 million DPW yard that isn't even sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2074.4s">And</a> it's brand new, because it has problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2076.741s">So</a> it needed more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2078.262s">So</a> the balance is shifted towards the schools already. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2083.364s">We</a> can put it in Haines Square, because there's plenty of empty lots and empty storefronts there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2088.967s">I</a> wish it was in the Medford Square, because that is the most vibrant place that it can lift the square right up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2096.85s">Between</a> the library being redone, the Chevalier, and the TV3 being in a storefront, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2102.938s">It</a> can really pick up the square and make it more user-friendly, make the square better, bring people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2109.141s">They'll</a> have something to do besides go to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2111.542s">They'll</a> have something to eat because they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2114.243s">So</a> it'll all work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2115.704s">But</a> if you don't, if you let this stay at the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2119.878s">which</a> is better than nothing, but it's still going to hamper free speech up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2125.679s">It</a> really will. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2126.659s">Because</a> it's going to be, people are going to feel that they're in a public building, and they're going to feel like they can't say certain things because they're in a public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2134.661s">Plus,</a> it's not accessible the way that it would be in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2138.222s">But</a> right now, you can put it in Haines Square, because I know that there are empty storefronts right on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2143.803s">and</a> you can just tuck it right in there for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2146.025s">But</a> anyway, thank you for listening, and I hope that we have free speech, and the arts, and business, and all of that that can come from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2153.311s">Those</a> three things, the library, the Chevalier, and TV3, or community access, would all, you know, just build up the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2160.898s">Those</a> three things anchor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2162.38s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3857.521s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3857.901s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3862.724s">Churchill</a> said, those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3868.467s">If</a> we do not take our city-side building maintenance seriously, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3874.315s">They</a> will undoubtedly fall into disrepair, as did the schools, the DPW, and currently the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3881.237s">Assuming</a> that we put off tearing down and building out a 21st century public safety building, which I do not endorse forfeiting, we still need to insert a building maintenance budget for each city side building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3895.22s">The</a> school side has a person in charge of school buildings and can identify the problems and priorities for the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3902.622s">We</a> need the same on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3904.885s">If</a> we have the money to hire a public relations officer for the school side at the cost to the taxpayer of $85,000 a year, then we can afford a chief of maintenance for city-side buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3918.129s">We</a> need a log of problems and schedule for their maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3921.409s">We</a> need a list of all city-owned buildings and inspections annually to identify their problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3928.791s">Whoever</a> said you can't fight City Hall is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3933.599s">Local</a> politicians do react to the populace when the populace makes its voice heard loud enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3941.182s">When</a> the parents come out in force, stadiums, the high school pool, and the technology labs are funded and built. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3948.246s">The</a> problem is the voice for city buildings are not loud enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3953.268s">And</a> for those who believe I am against the schools, note that I have spoken out against excessive spending on the city side, i.e., the garage, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3962.878s">the</a> Water Taxi, the Brooks Estates, and a whole new building for the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3968.22s">We</a> will do well to save the two, quote, luxury buildings we have, which is the library and the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3977.382s">As</a> for all other building structures, they are mandatory and need to be tended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3983.784s">We</a> could also look at street safety, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3986.925s">crosswalk</a> reflectors and underground infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3990.466s">And</a> I say that because I was in Haines Square <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3992.682s">And</a> everybody's coming in at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3995.144s">And</a> at night, at 5, 530, all you see is a flood of headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4000.007s">And</a> you can't see the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4001.368s">And</a> you can't see a person crossing the crosswalk until they actually go in front of somebody's headlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4007.072s">So</a> it's very, very dangerous there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4009.754s">So</a> we need to public safety of the sidewalks and all the rest of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4014.878s">I'm</a> ad nauseam. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4016.339s">You</a> know my story. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4019.061s">This</a> is not a luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4020.602s">This</a> will cost you more in the end <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4023.252s">unserviced.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4024.653s">I</a> vote to take the PR money and put it towards a chief of city side maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4029.516s">Keep</a> in mind the building inspector is for the whole city, not just city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4034.819s">So</a> if you have the argument that we have a building inspector, well he's in the, or she or whatever, they, the two of them, are in charge of every single building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4043.464s">That</a> means house, two families, single, buildings, condos, you name it, retail, commercial, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4050.665s">The</a> Brooks estates to the Craddock house or the Tufts house to the royal house to the school They're responsible for every building Okay, so we need a person specifically and I think mr. Marx was the one that brought this up a while back that we need somebody for the city side and Unfortunately to my friends over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4070.161s">I</a> respect their opinion, but the pie is only so big and unless you do a two and a half override the pie is only so big and so I <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4079.048s">While</a> I've spoken out against excessive city side spending I'm not totally against the schools but the schools have gotten the lion's share lately and it really needs to be shifted so that the fire substations are maintained <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4094.112s">The</a> police department, even if you don't tear it down, which I believe we should, it needs to be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4100.753s">And</a> the City Hall, hello, anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4106.234s">And</a> so we need to have maintenance on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4109.875s">For</a> the library as well, because if you want to use it, you have to make sure it's maintainable, make sure that people can walk into the library without the ceiling falling in on them, which we know is behind and backlogged. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4121.357s">So</a> we need to take it and address all these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4123.758s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M/2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M.html">Medford City Council - October 20, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=528.528s">Hi,</a> I'm Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Madison. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=530.75s">I'm</a> a big proponent of the theater, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=534.673s">As</a> you know, I also push your buttons, but this is something that pushes my buttons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=540.857s">I</a> love the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=541.918s">I</a> love the acts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=542.899s">I'm</a> going to two of them before Christmas, but the way it's being run with the religious groups in there on Sunday mornings has to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=551.528s">It</a> is inappropriate for religious groups to look at that as if it's a church. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=556.371s">It</a> is being rented and looked at as if it is a church by two groups of people, and it needs to come to a close. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=564.715s">If</a> we value this city as this asset, then we need to kick in the money for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=571.739s">I</a> don't know how, but we need to kick in the money for it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=574.921s">If</a> that's the case, and I've already told these folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=578.003s">We</a> need to have, we can open up all the buildings, whether it's the South Manfred Fire Station and hold it open for other religious events. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=585.949s">We</a> could rent out the schools for Buddhist, Methodist, Catholics, Jewish, every other religion under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=594.756s">These</a> folks can practice their religion and they can say things that are very controversial in this city, in that public space, in that public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=602.922s">They</a> can say a woman should submit to her husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=605.344s">They</a> can say that homosexuality is a sin. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=608.158s">They</a> can say anything because they have the religious right to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=611.539s">We</a> need to be very, very careful of how we run our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=616.081s">I</a> love the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=617.221s">I</a> want to see it be run right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=620.182s">And</a> that's all I want to say is that that needs to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=622.303s">And</a> if we value this piece of property as we should, we need to come up with the money for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=627.304s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7016.118s">Jean</a> Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7016.698s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7017.978s">10</a> Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7020.579s">Let's</a> remember why we have meters in the first place, because outsiders were parking in our squares all day for free and riding into town. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7031.422s">We</a> also had store owners and workers parking in front of their stores, taking up customer spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7039.063s">And</a> also, I just want to remind people <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7041.735s">that</a> the permits, parking, we have been already paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7046.078s">People</a> that live in the city before we even had meters were paying $10 a year to pay to park on our own street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7056.726s">So</a> that money has already been out there, just to remind you of that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7063.951s">You</a> recall that we didn't want to waste professional time of police officers on parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7070.237s">And</a> while we have accomplished this goal, make no mistake that parking enforcement ultimately still comes under the auspices of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7079.642s">Now,</a> while some of you will throw tomatoes at me because I know that not everybody agrees with this pay for parking issue, I have to say that I'm okay paying for parking for the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7093.59s">No</a> one plan will satisfy everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7096.611s">That's</a> worth repeating again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7098.94s">No</a> one plan will satisfy everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7101.922s">This</a> includes the two-hour or three-hour limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7105.524s">Someone</a> will always say it is too short a time for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7109.666s">This</a> city has had a free parking program for so long, it doesn't want any change at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7117.411s">We</a> need to admit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7119.352s">That</a> said, it should not be punitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7122.194s">The</a> amount could be as little as 25 cents for a half an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7126.552s">It</a> doesn't have to be 25 cents for 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7129.853s">The</a> point of paying is to create accountability and not milk the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7136.476s">Free</a> parking for two hours without a ticket creates a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7141.578s">You</a> must move your car if you wish to stay in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7145.439s">And</a> we want people to encourage people to hang out in the square and spend their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7151.223s">I</a> would much rather go out and feed the meter again than move my car and try to find another spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7157.227s">Let's</a> say we grow Medford Square and it is a bustling with life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7161.49s">We're</a> going to have to extend the hours till 8 p.m., and in some communities they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7166.853s">We</a> want people to hang out in the square for four or five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7170.375s">The</a> longer they stay, the more money we make from the store's businesses, not from the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7177.32s">We</a> shouldn't really look at it as making money from the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7181.173s">This</a> is what I think should happen to any proceeds from the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7186.117s">It</a> should be earmarked for mental health and training for police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7189.961s">The</a> issue of late was only properly resolved because it was on video and we were a national disgrace as a result of it going viral. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7199.469s">We</a> do not take the mental health of our police officers as seriously as we do their physical health. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7206.095s">We</a> need to normalize mental health for our officers <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7209.034s">before</a> something else happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7211.295s">We</a> need a zero tolerance policy, but we also can't neglect our responsibility to them and expect stress not to bubble up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7222.239s">While</a> unions protect an officer from being fired by a mayor for flimsy cause, there is a point at which an officer should be taken off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7232.663s">But</a> I also agree that we need a union to protect the officers in case the mayor's on the take. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7239.081s">If</a> the mayor is corrupt, right, then he could fire an officer that's doing his job very easily because he has the power to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7247.568s">So</a> the unions play that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7250.61s">While</a> unions have a say, they don't have the last say. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7255.033s">Unions</a> are limited by their very nature of not having a full sight of view of the whole city's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7262.239s">We</a> as citizens have a say in what requirements we want our officers, police officers to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7268.923s">But</a> don't think the public gets a pass either. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7271.624s">Our</a> job is to make sure that police officers aren't afraid to do their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7276.286s">And</a> if we continue to beat them up in the public eye and they fear being scapegoated for society's ills, they will not be there one day when you need them the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7287.15s">I</a> propose that every officer be required to talk to a therapist out of the city limits who specializes in police stress once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7294.688s">If</a> you have a better idea, please let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7297.749s">Only</a> if everyone does it will those who ask for help not be stigmatized. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7304.193s">If</a> it becomes routine, it will become a social norm and the guys won't pick on the minority of guys who go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7312.537s">To</a> my fellow citizens, this is not a wish list item. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7315.978s">This</a> is a mandatory item. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7317.899s">You</a> may offer a tweak here or there, but it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7321.901s">Police</a> men and women cannot strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7324.293s">And</a> that leaves them in a very bad place to be overworked and build up pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7328.876s">Remember,</a> when a police officer escalates, he or she does that in our name. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7334.1s">He</a> or she works for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7335.841s">The</a> unions need to do what is in the best interest for everyone, including the public they serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7341.144s">This</a> is one measure that can help prevent police officers from blowing a gasket. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7345.847s">If</a> you find another, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7348.929s">We,</a> the public, need to see the danger in not doing our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7354.26s">which</a> is to see that the needs of our police department are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7357.702s">Otherwise,</a> the blood will be on our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7362.205s">We</a> only have 105 police officers for a city of 58,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7365.147s">They</a> are a minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7368.229s">We</a> need to hear them now, not tomorrow when it is too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7372.972s">We</a> owe the police officers every opportunity to maintain his or her composure by looking after their health, both mental and physical. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7382.538s">And</a> we also owe them a thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7384.166s">for</a> doing a job that we do not want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7386.567s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6763.558s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6764.478s">I'm</a> also a proponent of all city buildings having a 5% building line item for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6772.524s">And</a> since this is such a beautiful presentation that we had professionally done by Hollywood, that should be replicated and it should be part of that 5% building <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6785.807s">line</a> item for maintenance for this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6787.988s">It</a> should be awesome, and it would be wonderful because you don't know when you're driving by, and you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6793.051s">In</a> the morning, Forest Street is backed up all the way to 93, and they sit there, and you know what that building holds, and it's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6800.235s">And</a> I like your idea with the concession stand, because it is missing, you know, and you go downstairs and you have... <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6807.058s">Yep,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6808.059s">And</a> so I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6809.619s">The</a> other thing is about rock concerts, the only thing I have to say is Rick Springfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6814.602s">I</a> heard some stories about stuff that went on in the bathrooms because they rock concerts. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6818.625s">And</a> I was a kid once too. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6820.186s">And</a> so you want to be careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6822.487s">And</a> I grew up with Rick Springfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6824.008s">But</a> I mean, things go on in bathrooms, like drug abuse and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6827.97s">And</a> you kind of want to stay away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6829.851s">But</a> the John Denver thing was awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6832.493s">And</a> the 75th anniversary, that Irish band that played was fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6836.875s">And</a> also, we can have plays, we can have comedians, we can have the diversity of shows, the movie theater, it's fantastic, and it will bring in money to all the restaurants in the area, it'll bring in foot traffic, and our Fridays and Saturday nights should be at least <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6854.569s">lit</a> up until 11 o'clock on a Friday night, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6858.614s">I</a> mean, why this city on a Friday or Saturday night doesn't have the lights on and people walking around? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6864.26s">I'm</a> not talking about maybe Monday night could be dead, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, but, you know, Thursday should pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6870.126s">People</a> should <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6871.367s">get</a> off work and go and hang out at Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6874.93s">And</a> Friday night and Saturday night should be bustling until at least 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6879.092s">It</a> wouldn't kill us, and it would bring business and money and tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6882.255s">And</a> that could be the center key, is the theater, because it's just awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6886.517s">The</a> location, the building structure, it's just beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6890.16s">And</a> it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6890.96s">And</a> I support this $50,000 or whatever it is, and I'm going to give the guy $20 to make it $20 less tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=6896.985s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g/2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g.html">Medford City Council - April 14, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2822.844s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2824.865s">Thank</a> you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2829.183s">The</a> Brooks Estates needs to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2832.506s">It</a> needs to be put to rest once and for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2835.85s">They've</a> tried to come up with the money for it, and they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2839.193s">They</a> can't come up with private funding, and there are some issues up there that I need to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2843.557s">But</a> first, I just want to say, we have to remember that the Brooks Estates <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2850.39s">comes</a> out of the history, a darker point in our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2854.973s">They</a> were blue bloods. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2856.955s">They</a> made their money off of the shipping industry, the insurance of the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2862.419s">They</a> insured the ships that were involved in the triangular trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2866.282s">So</a> they literally made their money off of slavery and rum, and if there were fires or piracy, they insured against those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2874.628s">So</a> we just have to keep that in mind when we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2878.971s">They</a> insured the cargo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2880.451s">that</a> included enslaved Africans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2882.932s">The</a> Brooks family also owned slaves, so the beautiful carriage house was built with blood money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2891.817s">The</a> well-meaning group of volunteers have not been able to find donors to support the $3.5 million it takes to renovate the place for occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2903.68s">Speaking</a> of occupancy, I hear that there are people living in that house which in no way could possibly pass today's codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2912.547s">So</a> Mr. Knight, I'm glad we have another person that can check out the buildings, because I want somebody up there checking out that building for occupancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2920.933s">Also,</a> there is going to be, or might be, I don't know if the baby happened or if it's going to happen, but I heard a rumor that this is a young couple and they could have a baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2933.024s">That's</a> a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2934.665s">That</a> house must have lead paint, electrical and plumbing deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2938.807s">I'm</a> a landlord and I hold a certificate of occupancy, an inspection from my insurance company, carbon monoxide alarms, a stove, income taxes with all receipts for repairs, home insurance, and a 21-page lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2952.936s">And</a> I own a two-family house, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2955.537s">That's</a> just for the renters downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2958.238s">We,</a> the entire city of Medford, are on the hook for any accident or incident that may happen on that property, not just the Brooks volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2968.446s">It</a> is time to move the occupants out, even if it costs the city to move them out, to do it and tear down the buildings once and for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2978.033s">I</a> know that it's hard for those people that put so much time and energy and effort into it, but then they're not the only ones that have other ideas for the city <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2989.568s">I</a> have ideas for the city too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2992.01s">I</a> would love to have that dance hall taken down so that when you come off the highway you see this beautiful structure called the people's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2999.015s">I</a> would love to take the library, invest three and a half million dollars, put another level on there and call it an art center or something so that we can maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3009.635s">still</a> maintain a library, make it more useful for modern day people because we have the internet and people don't use the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3016.782s">But</a> if we made it a library slash art center, maybe we could continue that public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3023.728s">But</a> I can't do that in good conscience and look at the police department, the police personnel, the DPW, the streets, the plumbing <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3032.08s">The</a> sewer pipes that aren't getting any younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3034.081s">The</a> buildings in this area that aren't getting any younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3037.241s">I</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3038.122s">I</a> can't look them in the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3039.422s">I</a> can't look the buildings in the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3040.742s">God</a> knows this one could use three and a half million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3044.623s">It</a> just goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3049.984s">I</a> also want a center for kids in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3052.625s">That's</a> another one of my pluses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3054.165s">That's</a> another one of my dream sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3057.646s">What</a> I'm saying is that it's a luxury to have the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3061.415s">And</a> it's one that we can't afford, and we've got to put it to rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3063.376s">It's</a> got to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3064.577s">Because</a> we have to get on with the really serious issues that this city is facing in economics and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3071.38s">And</a> I've spoken to some old timers, and they don't want it to be even remained as a green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3079.405s">They</a> look at that Brooks Estates, and they go, oh, plots. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3082.967s">They</a> have plots in their head. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3084.508s">They're</a> dying, their friends are dying, and they want to be buried here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3088.29s">And</a> they see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3090.175s">as</a> future burial ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3092.897s">I'm</a> not suggesting that we do that, but I'm saying that there are a lot of people who would just like to turn that into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3098.262s">If</a> you want to keep it as a green space, I'm okay with that, but we have to put to rest the house, the structure, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3105.668s">That</a> said, the $3.5 million needs to go towards a new police station and to fund 15 more police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3113.454s">We</a> need more DPW workers for the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3116.023s">which</a> need to be regularly swept, striped, crosswalks, squares need some life, like flower buckets and lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3124.57s">There</a> are many needs in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3125.911s">The</a> Brooks Estates has got to put this to rest, and the city can come together on what we really need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3133.117s">Needs</a> and wants are two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3136.14s">Again,</a> I want to thank those people that have put their attention into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=3140.603s">But</a> they've got to realize that their dream isn't going to end. <a

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3804.753s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3805.194s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3806.474s">And</a> I want to thank Mr. Penta for bringing this very important issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3809.717s">This</a> city, I want to keep it simple, deserves a community access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3813.419s">It's</a> that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3814.84s">And</a> I'm glad that you brought up the 10-year, Mr. Caraviello, the 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3819.563s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3819.923s">That's</a> a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3821.465s">Maybe</a> 5 years or whatever, but 10 years is a stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3824.967s">And</a> yes, we should have to approve it as a body because all the other contracts are over 3 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3831.333s">Excellent</a> point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3832.313s">And</a> I want to thank Mr. Knight for his suggestion of putting a person from this council to help the negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3840.66s">I</a> think that's wonderful, especially given the past history with this station. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3844.685s">The</a> mayor messed it up the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3846.326s">It</a> was his ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3847.187s">He</a> screwed it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3848.668s">And</a> I don't want to beat that bloody. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3851.07s">But</a> I want to recall that the mayor did hire a little – he put together a three-person committee, which in my mind was skewed or not necessarily qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3864.001s">We</a> had a priest, which was a very nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3865.882s">He's</a> honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3866.643s">But</a> what does he know about cable access? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3869.508s">We</a> had a person with conflict of interest who gets paid by the PEG monies, and we had another person who was a nice guy, but he wasn't anybody that really represented the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3883.335s">It</a> was a very narrow focus for that committee that he put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3887.758s">That</a> said, he had those recommendations in his hands, okay, and you know what he did with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3894.221s">He</a> put them in the desk drawer, and he didn't pay any attention to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3897.523s">That's</a> what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3898.845s">But</a> he does say that he's going to use the money through the school system, through the voc system, which I'm happy to see that, first of all, again, the bad behavior's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3910.096s">Thank</a> God for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3911.517s">The</a> negative uses of the TV station are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3914.28s">Thank</a> you for that, and thank you, Joe, for all your work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3918.725s">But</a> we still don't see a station today, and we need to see one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3924.211s">We're</a> paying that money, and I think the reason why Mayim McGlynn is doing his dance again is because he's going to wait until the last day of the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3934.606s">He</a> got the letter December 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3936.528s">He's</a> going to wait until April 17th or April 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3939.892s">He's</a> going to hold his meeting and he's not going to want to publicize it because he knows it's going to be a complaint session. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3947.661s">If</a> you really told the people, the parents out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3951.025s">that</a> their kids weren't having their hockey games on TV and everything else, that they're being denied the history, the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3957.909s">If</a> they really heard all of that and they really, it penetrated in their soul that they've been denied this, they'd be at that meeting and they'd be saying, what have you done? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3966.694s">But</a> they, I don't know, for whatever, because we don't have a good media system, they don't really hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3974.519s">And</a> they would show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3976.46s">And</a> we are being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3977.56s">Every</a> day that we don't have a station, we're being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3981.028s">a</a> historical log of everything that happens in the city, all of the events, the plays that could be being recorded at the auditorium, and he showed up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3990.299s">I</a> was going to say, you know, the arts community <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3993.621s">could</a> get on this and do something with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=3996.002s">We</a> do have an arts community, and as far as I can see from all the other communities, the arts people are the ones that run these stations locally, or at least have a huge plug in the system of these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4008.028s">We</a> have an arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4009.269s">The</a> mayor showed up for the 75th anniversary of the Chevalier, and he gave the Chevalier people a plaque for their 75th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4018.634s">He</a> showed up for that, so he knows the arts people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4020.945s">It's</a> not like he doesn't know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4022.245s">He</a> doesn't want to invite them in on the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4025.306s">He</a> hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4025.906s">Because</a> if he did, they would love that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4027.587s">That's</a> what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4028.707s">They</a> live for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4030.027s">They're</a> musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4031.127s">They</a> paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4033.148s">They're</a> creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4034.228s">That's</a> what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4035.248s">They</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4036.129s">And</a> if he reached out to them, he doesn't want to reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4039.329s">Because</a> he really wants to keep it in a tight little niche for himself so that he can control the media. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4046.231s">Again,</a> I hope that the mayor opens up his mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4050.152s">and</a> lets this city become a thriving city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4055.377s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2570.366s">Oh,</a> then I apologize wholeheartedly to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2576.107s">But</a> I would say that we do have a city that I've talked to people in Wellington, and they have relatives in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2582.435s">And</a> we have a city that's kind of divided by sections or segments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2586.116s">And</a> the folks that live in North Medford aren't as thrilled about the parking permit program, because they don't have as many problems with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2593.478s">So</a> the thought that they might get ticketed, or have to shuffle things around, or have to pay for a permit parking pass, they're not as thrilled about it as the people who need relief, like the people in South Medford, West Medford near the commuter rail, or Wellington near Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2609.302s">And</a> so I just wanted to put that out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2612.733s">You</a> know, it's going to have to be a joint effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2614.594s">But</a> I want to apologize then, because I misheard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2617.915s">And</a> I'm glad I misheard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2619.336s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2620.116s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7682.581s">Yes,</a> Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7684.681s">And</a> I'm going to say two nice things about this program, and then that'll set me off from going off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7693.524s">First</a> of all, one of the good things about this program is that it saves our police from becoming, in other words, for other better words, meter maids, which is a waste of their time, which satisfies one of my requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7709.988s">parking</a> enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7711.128s">So</a> that's one good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7713.409s">I'm</a> glad to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7715.409s">And</a> the second thing is it got the commuters from other cities from stopping and parking in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7722.13s">So</a> those are my two compliments to this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7724.731s">Everything</a> else is a complete, if we didn't have a 10-year contract with these folks, we would scrap this whole thing and start fresh. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7731.552s">I</a> mean, the amount of changes and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7735.292s">And</a> I have to say, with all due respect to the police chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7739.3s">It</a> is not his job to set policy, which he is manipulating and working with, not manipulating, that's a bad word, but he is working and tweaking policy that the mayor should be here on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7752.548s">That's</a> what's getting my blood pressure up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7754.449s">The</a> mayor should be here taking his own heat for his own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7758.511s">He's</a> making the chief of police take the heat, waste the chief's time when he should be doing other things in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7764.535s">That's</a> what got my blood up today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7768.798s">You</a> know, I have a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7769.959s">But</a> the other thing is about Mr. Marks, he was on that committee or commission or whatever it was for the parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7775.101s">Total</a> insult to all the time that they spent on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7778.742s">And</a> I know that the police chief is paid to be on it because he's paid as a city employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7783.844s">But</a> there were citizens that were on that committee that spent time on that parking enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7788.787s">Had</a> that been recognized by the police chief, I mean by the mayor, we wouldn't be in this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7794.509s">And</a> I don't have anything against the outside vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7797.08s">But</a> because we're in this contract now, we're signed into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7800.442s">And</a> it just, all of these issues need to be brought up next week when the mayor is in town and sitting here, taking the heat for his own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7810.527s">Because</a> it's his and it's yours, you know, for whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7814.968s">You</a> can argue about how much responsibility is the council's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7818.652s">But</a> it is also, it is primarily the signature is by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7823.498s">He</a> has the only authority to tweak it, change it, put a stop sign here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7828.344s">He's</a> the ultimate authority for where there's going to be a parking meter or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7832.108s">And</a> the kiosks, don't even get me started on the kiosks, because that has caused more problems than if you had just put meters in, quarter-fed meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7842.344s">You</a> know, whether you agree with it or not, and put in too well parking, and then have people watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7847.374s">Everybody</a> understands a meter, a simple, simple, simple meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7851.096s">Everybody</a> understands it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7852.777s">And</a> I just have to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7854.718s">So,</a> I mean, I think we should have went by the recommendations of the parking commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7860.862s">I</a> think it should have been reconsidered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7862.463s">But</a> again, the two things I'm going to, so that my blood pressure comes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7867.103s">One,</a> the police are not wasting their time, although the police chief is now wasting his time on this, when it should be the mayor that's taking the heat for his own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7875.95s">He</a> is the enforcement of policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7879.312s">He</a> is not the signature on the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7882.655s">He</a> is not the guy that makes the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7884.416s">The</a> mayor is the guy that makes the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7886.177s">And</a> number two, it got the commuter traffic off of the streets, which was the second good thing about this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7893.543s">So</a> with that, I'll shut up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7895.885s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8170.302s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8170.962s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8172.282s">Thank</a> you very much for letting me speak here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8175.423s">Haines</a> Square is a great square, and it has great potential to thrive, and yet left neglected, and without proper advocacy from the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8187.186s">If</a> you would just take a good look at the architecture, you would see what I see, the base for a wonderful meeting place for the citizens of Medford to commune, as well as purchase goods and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8199.248s">To</a> revitalize the square, we need to have joint meetings between the state officials because of Route 60, Route 28, and the MBTA bus barns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8210.077s">Local</a> politicians, especially the mayor and small business community, all need to get together to have a good, wholesome plan for the whole unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8220.486s">It</a> has to be taken as a whole area and not just piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8225.537s">The</a> best assets the square has are Dempsey's restaurant, without a doubt, the best combination of community with its breakfast menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8234.363s">I</a> watch people all have coffee, commune, talk, families, friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8239.526s">It's</a> a social place as well as a place to receive, you know, it's a food place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8243.568s">So</a> it's absolutely the cornerstone in its proximity to the square, how it's central. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8248.131s">It's</a> one of the central eye catches of the square and it's absolutely one of the anchors of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8255.769s">But</a> again, the sidewalk outside of it has potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8259.772s">It</a> has those seatings with the picnic tables or whatever, but they're not used. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8265.437s">As</a> it is, the man that owns it says he has to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8268.379s">It's</a> a city property, the sidewalk city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8271.982s">He's</a> not supposed to be responsible to shovel the snow, but he often does. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8277.265s">He</a> takes care of that, and so do the other two businesses, the florist and the pizza parlor, because nobody else will. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8284.103s">because</a> the city doesn't have the services that it used to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8287.425s">But</a> that space, that little triangle where Dempsey's is, is absolutely perfect to have umbrellas with people out there eating and communing from, especially Dempsey's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8298.031s">Or</a> eating a sandwich from a local sub shop down Alfredo's Kitchen or something, get a sub, come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8305.195s">It's</a> on the same side of the block. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8307.176s">You</a> don't have to go out of your own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8309.658s">Modern</a> hardware is another huge staple, which has offered many people the convenience and personal touch for home improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8317.004s">The</a> laundromats are a staple for the area because of the large rental apartments all throughout the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8323.769s">What</a> needs to be said is that Haines Square has a lot of two-family houses that are now used as rental properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8330.575s">Both</a> up and down are used as rental properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8332.937s">People</a> live outside of the city, own those houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8335.979s">it's</a> not no longer just owner occupied like it used to be back in the day and so you have a high population of people that use the buses and use <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8343.793s">you</a> know, different mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8345.954s">And</a> they also use the dry cleaners and the laundromat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8349.695s">The</a> laundromat there is absolutely essential because a lot of people that live in those rental properties, a lot of owners don't let them use the basement for washer and dryers or sometimes have coin-operated machines in their basement or something, but a lot of renters use the laundromat in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8367.6s">They</a> can walk right down there and use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8369.541s">So</a> those laundromats need to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8373.848s">The</a> downside of the square is its central focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8377.21s">As</a> you drive up from Medford Square, which has a liquor store, which used to be the movie theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8382.814s">Now,</a> I realize that a liquor store is a legal business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8385.556s">It's</a> a legitimate business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8386.597s">It</a> brings in a lot of tax revenue, because the taxes on liquor are higher than other goods and services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8392.321s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8393.702s">However,</a> as you're coming up that square, where Spring Street comes into Route 60, the thing that catches your eye, which used to be a movie theater, is now a liquor store. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8403.402s">I'm</a> not against that personal person that owns it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8406.744s">But</a> if anybody could arrange to have that liquor store move to a place along the side of a bunch of blocker stores and not be the central focus, that would make the whole thing different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8418.072s">And</a> also, if you had an eatery inside that theater, if you had an eatery with Wi-Fi, that would be awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8426.817s">The</a> whole feel of that liquor store area would change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8431.42s">If</a> you had nice glass windows that were open and not filled with signs for Bud Light or whatever, then, wait a minute, I'm not done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8439.503s">Oh,</a> oh, okay, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8441.604s">So,</a> because if you look at it, you see Bud Light and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8444.725s">Instead,</a> if you saw people sitting in chairs, you know, using their devices, and I will agree now, I've come to change my mind, I'll even let you put a bike rack in front of that area so that if people are traveling by bicycle, they can go and hang there and have lunch, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8462.312s">But</a> anyway, if you change that, you would change the whole feel of that whole region. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8467.576s">And</a> I'm not against the liquor store, if you want to put it to the side in another spot, more power to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8472.479s">But</a> it's a central focal point, and if you put an eatery in there, man, a lunch place, sandwich, soup, something like that, where people have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8481.245s">a</a> lunch thing, because you've got the breakfast thing right over there at Dempsey's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8485.426s">It</a> would really be awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8488.927s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8489.788s">The</a> other big problem is the MBTA bus barns and the brick building that sits in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8494.909s">The</a> brick building was built in, like, 1922. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8498.431s">I</a> realize that there is an electrical infrastructure for the bus barns, and it is a problem, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8506.559s">It's</a> the MBTA's problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8507.76s">It's</a> not my problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8508.54s">It's</a> not Haines Square's problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8509.701s">It's</a> not the city's problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8511.101s">The</a> MBTA buses sit there, and they look horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8515.543s">Imagine</a> if that bus barn area was a green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8519.385s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8520.306s">I</a> guess I'm transforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8521.486s">The</a> city's going in my head or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8523.587s">I'm</a> thinking green. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8525.088s">But</a> if that place, if that area was green, I've been around you people too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8529.53s">So</a> if that area was green with some benches to sit, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8535.365s">All</a> right, you buy a sandwich, you go and you sit on a bench with some green space instead of the bus barns, it would be another place that would be open for the community to come and sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8543.386s">I</a> don't want other buildings put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8544.867s">God</a> knows we've got enough buildings in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8547.547s">We</a> keep putting up developments every which way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8550.047s">You</a> get a postage stamp, they put up a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8552.368s">So</a> if you could take that and turn it into green space, but that's going to take the effort of the state representatives, the state senators, you people, the mayor, the small business community, the Chamber of Commerce, everybody's going to have to get in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8565.39s">But</a> visualize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8567.151s">Have</a> some imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8571.413s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8572.913s">With</a> the help of the state delegation, blah, blah, blah, I would like to see the green space, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8577.315s">Now,</a> the MBTA is another problem, because we have buses and trucks that often go through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8585.099s">So</a> if you're going to introduce, God forbid, bike lanes, because I personally think it's an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8591.161s">But</a> if you are, you're going to have to decide, are we going to take out parking spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8595.437s">in</a> order to put a bus lane? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8597.699s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8598.879s">But</a> whatever you do, you're going to have to involve the MBTA, because trucks, huge trucks, go down there to deliver, especially for modern hardware. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8607.225s">I</a> see trucks all day dropping off stuff for modern hardware. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8611.247s">And</a> they're not semi. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8612.768s">They're</a> just small. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8614.229s">But</a> they are trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8615.07s">They're</a> commercial trucks traversing and buses that traverse all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8619.153s">So</a> the MBTA is going to have to be involved if we move a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8622.895s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8623.736s">Design</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8625.022s">I</a> don't get paid to do this, but there are people that get paid to design these kind of squares, and if we had some imagination, we could transform that square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8634.67s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8636.632s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8637.132s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8638.213s">What</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8640.235s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8641.015s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8642.256s">As</a> for general cleanliness, we used to have section men, or we could use women today, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8649.696s">in</a> the squares, whose sole job was to pick up the litter in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8654.919s">Now,</a> I understand that it costs a lot of money, but whether the DPW hires more personnel to become square people, that sounds funny, but square cleaners, I don't know how to say it, but sweepers, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8670.288s">part</a> time, part of their sessions, or maybe Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or whatever, or hire senior citizens, I don't care how it gets done, but we need to have people to clean up the litter because there's a lot of litter blown around, and I don't have to tell you people, the lines for the parking spaces are not, they're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8690.32s">It's</a> kind of a weird, the way the square is too, if somebody, you're kind of like when you come in from, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8698.19s">Spring</a> Street to Salem, it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of, people do their own thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8704.532s">So,</a> you know, it could be one lane, but there's two or three cars stacked, like lined up, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8711.434s">So,</a> whatever, the traffic people that organized could straighten that out and maybe make the island in the middle bigger <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8718.636s">make</a> it so that there's only room for one car to go one way so that you don't see piles up or maybe the island could also become bigger for another use like when we have our festivals in the fall the fall festival they use that as the stage prop area for the festival for where the stage is so if you expand that little bit <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8737.71s">You</a> could have the thing, you know, use it for some other space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8741.451s">But</a> anyway, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8744.693s">So</a> I don't care how you get it done, but we need to have section people to clean up and to paint and to do all of that stuff, to monitor flower pots, water them, whatever, you know, those barrels with the flowers in them, make it nice with the lights, with the hanging pots and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8763.34s">I</a> have a dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8764.32s">Anyway.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8766.518s">So</a> anyway, the signage all looks trashy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8770.54s">There's</a> too many things in the windows in the stores, and if you had the awnings or all of the signage uniform, it doesn't have to be exactly the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8778.463s">You</a> can have your own personality, but if there's some kind of consistency throughout the signage, that would improve the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8786.886s">As</a> for parking enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8789.415s">The</a> mayor assigned a committee to review the problem back in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8794.057s">He</a> had ignored the recommendations of that committee and it has led to chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8797.699s">We've</a> talked about that, but I'm going to go over it real quick because I wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8800.821s">The</a> decision has been made by the mayor to go with an outside private contractor and has been signed for seven years with three more added options. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8810.236s">Many</a> of the businesses in Haines Square are not in the Chamber of Commerce, and therefore have not had a voice in the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8817.723s">Not</a> until now, and I understand the Chief has talked to some of those business owners, that's wonderful, but I know for a fact that a lot of those business owners don't belong to the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8827.551s">No</a> offense, but they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8831.194s">There</a> are inconsistencies in the policy where Dabbs Lock is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8836.053s">And</a> he's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8837.134s">I'm</a> a frequent customer of Artery Lock and will still call them for business, but they do have an advantage over the other businesses in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8846.219s">If</a> you're going to do parking enforcement meters, which is my preference, over kiosks or whatever, you have to go all the way down Route 60 because it's really a commercial slash retail <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8858.687s">You've</a> got the gas stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8859.827s">You've</a> got the Brazilian food place, which I'm a frequent customer of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8865.269s">You've</a> got nappies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8867.449s">You've</a> got artery lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8869.53s">There's</a> a whole bunch of businesses along there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8871.95s">They've</a> got the bike shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8872.811s">There's</a> a bike shop on Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8874.671s">They</a> should be metered as well, because that is just as much a commercial-slash-retail place as any other place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8884.313s">And</a> so it's, you know, when Dabbs Lock came up here, I was feeling his pain because Artery Lock doesn't have to pay that, doesn't have to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8893.401s">With</a> all due respect, people who come from Malden have told me that they haven't stopped at the Dunkin' Donuts in Haines Square because they don't understand the kiosk system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8903.884s">It</a> might be $5, but I want Malden's $5, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8908.226s">At</a> the very least, regular coin-operated meters should be put in place for simplicity's sake, and that would be my recommendation, to get rid of the kiosks and go with meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8918.33s">People</a> see meters, and they understand them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8920.071s">Haines</a> Square has a high rental population, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8923.935s">Now,</a> this is a sensitive topic, but while I see immigrant groups from South American to Asian have small family-owned businesses in Haines Square, there are not a lot of black American-owned businesses that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8935.497s">I</a> would like to see a black-owned barbershop and one other black-owned business go into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8940.858s">The</a> population of that area is changing, and it would go a long way to incorporate all the new people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8947.799s">There</a> are a couple of open storefronts currently on the Alfredo's kitchen block. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8953.04s">across</a> from the stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8954.92s">And</a> so that would be a great place to put in a barbershop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8957.561s">And</a> so we could reach out to the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8959.701s">You</a> could reach out to Neil. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8961.181s">You</a> could reach out to other, you know, people in the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8967.142s">Go</a> to places, the schools where they make barbers, where they train barbers, and get somebody and say, hey, can we help you open up a barbershop? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8976.064s">And</a> just open up a barbershop, because the area is changing, and we need to change with those times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=8983.366s">I'm</a> almost done. <a

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1024.659s">Hang</a> on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1025.679s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1026.36s">I</a> see some things that are not essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1029.302s">I</a> don't see all things that are non-essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1031.523s">But</a> I see a bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1033.404s">I</a> see, believe it or not, and I know you're going to be against me on this, playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1038.127s">These</a> are non-essentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1039.568s">If</a> you're going to put pressure on the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1042.656s">who</a> has all authority to change this, to sign off on this, and you've got to build up pressure in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1048.766s">I'm</a> sorry, but you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1050.268s">If</a> you don't build up pressure with the citizens to get them in here, to get them angry, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1055.11s">then</a> you can explain to them that the police station needs to come first, and then they can have their playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1059.433s">Because</a> if you keep on doing this one million at a time, you're never going to see a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1064.616s">You're</a> going to give him what he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1066.277s">So</a> if there's a bucket truck, that's a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1068.959s">If</a> there's a plow, that's a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1071.22s">But</a> if it's a bike lane, it's not a necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1074.202s">If</a> it's a playground, I understand they can be dangerous, but you're going to have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1080.646s">So</a> you guys can disagree with me if you want, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1084.182s">But</a> this is the only time that you're going to be able to have leverage over the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1088.866s">And</a> it's up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1090.327s">It's</a> your call. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1091.468s">It's</a> your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1092.649s">But</a> when the police station doesn't get built, don't come looking for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1097.073s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1098.614s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5574.972s">Gene</a> Martin, thank you, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5577.572s">I'm</a> glad you brought it up again, and I'm glad you went through it line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5581.593s">I</a> do still think that the police chief shouldn't have to get up here at the podium and ask for a basic thing, like the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5590.067s">He</a> shouldn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5591.328s">Nor</a> should the union representative have to come up here and beg for a decent building to work out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5597.415s">I</a> just don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5598.997s">I</a> think that the parks are luxuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5601.26s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5602.352s">The</a> schools are not, but the parks are luxuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5605.053s">Yes,</a> they add to the quality of life, and yes, the memorial does. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5608.474s">Speaking</a> as a veteran, it's still a luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5611.815s">Some</a> of the other issues are still luxuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5615.376s">The</a> bike, everything's done in piecemeal again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5617.857s">I</a> just hear, you know, a bike path, you know, just on Winthrop Street, and the bikers are here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5624.739s">I</a> don't think it's safe personally to have bikes on the streets, but they are here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5628.987s">So</a> we need to work with the bike community, but we need to do these things as a full city project, not piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5637.107s">enforcement</a> that's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5639.127s">There's</a> illegal parking here, there, and everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5641.268s">So</a> how can you make a plan for where the lines are going to go when the parking isn't straightened out yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5646.569s">Everything's</a> done in piecemeal, and I just hear that resounding in my head as you went line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5653.07s">I</a> want to see the arts community, and we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5655.95s">I</a> need Mr. Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5657.37s">The</a> city needs Mr. Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5659.391s">I</a> know sometimes I'm hard on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5661.231s">I'm</a> hard on Mr. Koenig, or whatever his name is, the bike guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5665.172s">I'm</a> hard on all of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5667.032s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5667.973s">We</a> need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5669.374s">I'm</a> inviting them up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5670.455s">I</a> want them to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5672.716s">But</a> I also want them to come up here and speak on behalf of the police chief and the police union and get this building done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5679.802s">I</a> want to hear them petition for the police department before all of these other extras come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5685.606s">And</a> if they can do that, then maybe I'll be able to have more peace about allowing more money for the old house <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5695.086s">or</a> the arts community or something that I consider a luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5698.57s">Because</a> one day you're going to need the police station here, and maybe sooner than you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5703.795s">And</a> it's not going to be there when you need it to be there for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5706.838s">We</a> have a lot of crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5707.939s">We</a> have a lot of need for detective space in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5711.502s">The</a> police building was not designed for <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5715.229s">2014.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5715.529s">We</a> all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5716.911s">So</a> I feel like I'm pounded on the same door over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5720.675s">And</a> I know you're sick of seeing me come up here and pound in on that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5723.839s">But</a> I don't think that the police chief <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5726.254s">should</a> have to come up here, nor the police union representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5729.735s">I</a> think it should be the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5731.275s">And</a> if we have to close down all of the playgrounds and the football field to get the attention of the people, you want to do that, I know you'll never do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5738.897s">But</a> it's a radical idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5740.717s">But</a> it would work because the people would be in here the next week saying, why did you close down my football field? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5746.898s">Well,</a> because we need something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5748.358s">We</a> need your participation in the city's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5751.839s">So</a> thank you very much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5753.68s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5754.76s">Name</a> and address for the record, sir.

<a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1212.859s">Like,</a> I pay $10 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1214.9s">Is</a> that part of this contracting situation, where they're going to have personnel go around and check all the permit parking streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1223.162s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1223.982s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1225.082s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1225.583s">And</a> that's my statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1226.383s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1235.561s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1239.483s">For</a> those people that pay $10 a year, I paid $10 a year for, I don't know, five, six, seven years or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1245.646s">My</a> parents have been gone since 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1247.607s">So</a> I've been paying since then $10 a year for parking enforcement on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1253.543s">And</a> we don't have parking enforcement in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1257.085s">Nobody</a> comes around to take it on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1259.927s">I</a> have a corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1260.648s">I</a> have a dead end street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1262.209s">The</a> corner has a person parked on there that shouldn't be there because it makes it narrow for emergency vehicles to come in and go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1268.492s">It</a> should be 100 feet from the corner, the sign, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1271.774s">So</a> I'd like to have that removed so that there's nobody on the corner because there's only one way in and out of the street.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1279.442s">Oh,</a> my question is, with the ticketing, are you going to have personnel actually coming around? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1286.604s">I</a> know that the meters are going into the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1288.985s">But</a> are there going to be people going around and giving tickets to the people who already have paid permit parking?
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1319.126s">I</a> paid $10 a year.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1326.268s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1327.288s">Okay,</a> so who's going to come around? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1331.569s">The</a> people from the contract.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1337.29s">Okay,</a> thank you.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4052.532s">Oh,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4053.332s">Hi,</a> Jeanne Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4055.194s">I</a> just want to reiterate that you can't look at this parking enforcement program in isolation from the greater city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4062.422s">And</a> when you start ticketing in the residential areas that have permit parking, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4066.727s">Where</a> are those cars going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4067.668s">They're</a> going to go into the next streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4069.369s">Same</a> thing's going to happen in the business districts, especially in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4074.775s">If</a> you start ticketing, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4076.63s">or</a> having signs, those side streets are going to get filled up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4080.653s">In</a> Haines Square, same thing's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4083.395s">Side</a> streets are going to get filled up with cars, and they're going to walk down to the store because they don't want to pay or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4089.039s">But</a> I do agree with you, Mr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4090.36s">I</a> think the free 15 minutes or half an hour, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4093.042s">But</a> it's already signed in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4095.164s">So</a> believe me, you're going to hear from the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4098.766s">When</a> this thing goes in, you're going to see them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4101.809s">They</a> will be here, and they will be talking to you about the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4105.812s">So</a> you don't have to worry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4107.052s">But</a> again, I just want the money from the ticketing that's going to go on in West Medford Square or Medford Square or Haines Square to go towards new signage because there's no reason why we shouldn't have regular sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4119.834s">Why</a> should we have to have cops and bullhorns? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4122.135s">We</a> should just have signs that say, you know, street sweeping twice a year, whatever, here's the time, here's the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4128.696s">Why</a> don't we have a uniform system for snow emergencies and whatnot? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4132.757s">So</a> I think that you can't look at it in isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4134.837s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9171.379s">Gene</a> Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9173.562s">I'm</a> glad that this woman came up to speak on this topic, and I'm glad that she's here, and I encourage her to get her neighbors to come out because this is a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9182.652s">You</a> can do, through a cumbersome process as a landlord, have a separate meter put into your apartment, but it's very cumbersome. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9190.55s">to</a> have a separate meter for your tenant so that you have a separate bill from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9194.652s">But</a> ultimately, according to the law, you are still responsible if they don't pay their water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9199.514s">So</a> it really didn't make much sense for me to go through that process.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9216.622s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9217.402s">So</a> anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9219.379s">I</a> just want to thank her for coming up, and she made a good point about comparisons to cities, apples to apples. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9226.146s">I</a> think what we should do is see what Melrose pays, or whoever else is on the MWRA list, and see what they pay, you know, and how much overage they might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9235.677s">The</a> rate from MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9241.686s">The</a> rate structure, yeah, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9243.767s">Because</a> we do have an overage of $8 million, which is absolutely ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9247.509s">We</a> know that the mayor is doing that because he wants his bond rating to be low. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9251.452s">We</a> know that he's misusing the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9253.033s">He</a> should be returning that money back into the infrastructure of the city so that the water rates will actually be lower, and he's not doing that, and that's on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9262.678s">And</a> so, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9264.419s">Move</a> the question.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9780.262s">Gene</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street, and I can talk about it, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9783.566s">And</a> of course, as you know, I'm against having a casino, but the casino is coming.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9832.365s">We're</a> going to be getting sued by Atlawin tomorrow morning if you allow this to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9835.826s">Well,</a> you know, he's got a point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9838.087s">No,</a> seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9838.828s">The</a> man is a very powerful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9840.428s">No,</a> we're not worried about that.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9843.53s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9846.251s">Just</a> in general, it's... She can speak about casinos.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9850.633s">If</a> it comes in, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9852.658s">We</a> need to be prepared for if it comes in, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9856.98s">Because</a> I've talked to a lot of people that live outside of this area, and they're all voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9862.402s">They're</a> all just loyal. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9864.723s">And</a> so it's going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9866.704s">And</a> if it comes, what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9868.625s">How</a> are we going to prepare for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9869.805s">How</a> are we going to prepare Wellington Circle for the traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9873.447s">How</a> are we going to prepare law enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9876.32s">and</a> firefighters and everybody else that's involved, DPW workers and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9881.322s">We</a> need to prepare for what is inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9884.363s">In</a> my opinion, it's inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9886.024s">It's</a> coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9887.124s">So</a> we need to prepare ourselves as a city for what is coming to hit us. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9892.546s">And</a> it's going to be a big hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9894.607s">socially,</a> economically, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9898.169s">It's</a> going to make a cultural change in that whole region, Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9902.132s">It's</a> going to make a huge cultural change for that whole region, including me, because I'm kind of like not far from that, up Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9910.096s">Route</a> 16 traffic is going to get backed up, and it's inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9913.698s">So</a> I just wanted to say that, that we need to be prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9916.56s">We</a> need to have a master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9918.361s">We</a> need to get everybody on board with what we're going to do when it comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9922.823s">I'm</a> against it, but it's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9924.625s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4/2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 7, 2014 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6465.092s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6465.452s">Jean</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6467.833s">You're</a> absolutely right, Mr. Knight and Mr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6471.84s">If</a> we are one of the highest users of water, it's because we're one of the oldest cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6476.744s">If</a> you look at it from the state perspective, we're 1630. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6480.507s">We</a> were founded. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6481.648s">We're</a> one of the oldest communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6483.249s">We're</a> one of the most densest communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6485.591s">We're</a> not Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6486.632s">We're</a> not East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6488.413s">There</a> are more dense communities than us, but we are a dense community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6492.396s">And</a> as you go out of 495, you come across smaller communities and less need for the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6497.24s">And</a> they have wells. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6498.885s">You</a> go outside at 495 and they have well water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6502.409s">The</a> MWRA is around Boston, and it's a consolidated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6506.912s">And</a> Mr. Marks hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6510.175s">The</a> $8.5 million needs to be drawn down. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6516.439s">Unfortunately,</a> the mayor is doing what is in his legal right to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6521.042s">You</a> can't blame it on the mayor this time, because there's no law that prevents him from drawing off of this account as much as he can. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6529.587s">There</a> is no top number. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6532.869s">Oh</a> sure, go ahead.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6556.944s">OK,</a> so that is his responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6558.845s">So</a> he can.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6560.006s">He</a> can absolutely.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6561.707s">He</a> can absolutely take that number down and put it towards infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6565.35s">But</a> it's up to the people of Medford, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6567.691s">And</a> until the people of Medford decide that they're going to come here and show up, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6574.216s">and</a> make their voices heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6576.237s">And</a> I really do have an appreciation for you guys now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6579.319s">I</a> don't know if I'm going native or what. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6581.701s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6583.242s">But</a> I do see you guys as working really, really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6586.884s">And</a> as a body, I see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6589.025s">So</a> maybe I've been coming here for like three years now, and so I'm getting osmosis or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6594.408s">But</a> through osmosis, I'm coming to appreciate you guys instead of seeing you as the enemy. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6600.052s">Anywho,</a> so anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6603.914s">So</a> anyway, the mayor isn't doing anything illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6608.135s">So</a> either the people have to make him, by pressuring him, by showing up at his doorstep and saying, we want that $8 million drawn down to $1.5 million just in case there's a main water break. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6622.099s">And</a> until we do that, he can sit there and collect all the money he wants and use it for the bond rating, which is not what it's intended to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6631.342s">And</a> you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6633.53s">The</a> reason why we are such heavy users of water is because we have so many leaks in our system, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6640.7s">So</a> it's a self-feeding system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6642.702s">If</a> we don't take care of the leaks in the water and sewer, then we use more water as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6648.792s">So</a> it's a self-fulfilling problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6651.315s">And</a> until we take care of that, but it has to be the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6654.399s">You</a> guys can sit here all day and all night, and I've really heard you guys, all day and all night, all day and all night, say the same thing over and over again, and it's like a hamster wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6664.952s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6665.653s">Don't</a> give up, because you guys got the DPW yard built. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6668.874s">So</a> don't give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6670.055s">You</a> guys helped fix housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6671.437s">You</a> guys helped fix, get rid of TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6674.6s">You</a> guys are making a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6676.442s">You</a> got to keep on banging on that drum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6678.664s">But</a> until the people start helping you to force the issues, nothing's going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6685.452s">But</a> you got to keep your voices out there and be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6688.775s">So</a> I agree with the transparency, have your committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6692.557s">I</a> could start a petition on so many issues in the city.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6697.04s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6697.96s">Oh,</a> I already signed that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6699.461s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6699.841s">So</a> that's what I have to say on that topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6701.442s">Thank</a> you very much.

city would be in a total media blackout, really, with the exception of a couple of articles in the transcript, a couple of articles on the patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7469.898s">But</a> really, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7470.816s">This</a> is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7471.436s">This</a> is the one place where the people have an ability to have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7476.878s">More</a> people should use this forum when they have issues, when they have the issues of the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7483.26s">They</a> should be in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7484.72s">And</a> they shouldn't make you guys repeat the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7487.561s">They</a> should be here face after face, different face after different face. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7491.8s">But</a> that said, I'll leave that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7493.961s">I</a> do have some things about personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7497.203s">Mr.</a> Markson hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7499.504s">It's</a> a comprehensive problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7500.965s">Policing</a> is an absolutely, and Mr. Penta, and all of you, it's a comprehensive issue, and it's not gonna be solved just by increasing personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7510.931s">It</a> has to do with the traffic patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7515.093s">It</a> has to do with the demographic changes, and by that I mean prior to 2001, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7521.812s">Most</a> people that had a two-family house, one of those apartments was owned by the homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7527.215s">We</a> know by huge numbers, those two-family houses, when the old folks moved out, they sold it, and that property was used as rental income solely, as an investment and used as a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7542.705s">There</a> are so many two-family and three-family houses that are now businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7548.148s">What</a> they sell is a home, an apartment, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7551.974s">They</a> sell apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7553.854s">It's</a> no longer, you know, mom upstairs or dad downstairs or whatever and cousin or, you know, uncle. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7560.676s">There's</a> a couple left, but those are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7563.397s">There's</a> a lot of people that these two family houses, the person that owns the house doesn't live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7569.818s">And</a> that is a demographic change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7572.198s">And</a> people that rent, I don't care what you say, people that rent do not feel that they have the same voice as I do, who's a homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7579.898s">I</a> can come up here and I can feel in charge of my life more because I have a stake in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7585.619s">People</a> that rent have to answer to their landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7589.88s">And</a> if they come up here and they make a big deal, their landlords may take it against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7594.402s">They</a> shouldn't, but, you know, life is life, and that's the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7598.402s">So</a> we've had demographic shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7600.063s">We've</a> had racial demographic shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7602.543s">We've</a> had a whole bunch of changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7605.137s">in</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7605.878s">So</a> that's the traffic issues have to be handled, the parking enforcement should be citywide, and it should be completely citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7615.166s">It</a> should be for commercial, it should be for in front of hydrants, I don't care if you live in North Medford or West Medford, it should be completely citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7624.094s">Because</a> what happens is you have favoritism, and I know I'm getting to personnel, but it's all part of the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7630.905s">If</a> you, if you can, you can hire 200 police officers, but if you don't take care of these other issues, they're going to be chasing their own tails. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7639.053s">You</a> know, they're going to be chasing their own tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7640.635s">So</a> it has to be done comprehensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7643.458s">And</a> the building, he always talks about the building enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7647.982s">Um,</a> it, that pays for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7651.105s">And</a> so I'm all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7652.206s">That</a> pays for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7653.788s">That</a> guy or, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7655.319s">girl</a> or a couple of girls or guys can help with police enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7660.201s">And</a> everybody knows how many cars there are on this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7663.063s">And</a> the average single family has two cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7665.144s">The</a> average two family is going to have four cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7668.105s">It's</a> just that's the way it is, unless they're really right on top of the T. But they all know that because you pay an excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7675.929s">So</a> all of those issues, it should be handled not in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7680.191s">Somebody</a> talked about a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7681.252s">It</a> shouldn't be handled in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7682.792s">It</a> should be all inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7684.423s">And</a> it should be done properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7686.665s">And</a> unfortunately, we're behind the eight ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7688.346s">We've</a> been behind the eight ball on parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7690.367s">There</a> should have been meters in the squares a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7692.989s">There</a> should have been enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7694.13s">We</a> could say that shoulda, shoulda, woulda, coulda. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7697.112s">It</a> doesn't do us any good because it's water under the dam now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7701.495s">We</a> need to move from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7703.294s">and</a> do the best we can with the contract assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7706.216s">And</a> we're going to have to tweak it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7707.296s">We're</a> going to have to back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7708.777s">It</a> might be a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7710.558s">It</a> might end up to be a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7712.579s">But</a> we're going to have to work with that mess and then move forward from there, because something had to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7717.182s">Unfortunately,</a> it wasn't done 5, 10 years ago when it should have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7720.224s">But</a> that's where we are today, and that's what we have to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7722.885s">OK,</a> so thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7725.347s">First,</a> we only have 105 officers for a city of 57,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7728.508s">It</a> is ridiculous, given the proximity to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7734.063s">120</a> is a reasonable amount to start with. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7737.226s">Community</a> policing is also the only way you are going to increase visibility and build trust in neighborhoods which have large rental populations and or minority populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7747.735s">Walking</a> the beat, not sitting idle in a cruiser, will create trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7753.18s">I</a> would propose having them walk in pairs of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7756.583s">They</a> don't have to work together, but in the square in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7760.246s">One</a> over here, one over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7761.806s">They</a> could break up, but they need backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7765.388s">I'm</a> sorry, we don't live in a nice world anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7768.09s">And</a> so they need to have somebody available within a shout for their own safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7776.875s">People</a> don't want to accept this, but that's the world we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7779.877s">Walking</a> the beat, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7782.458s">Night</a> shift not included, but certainly days and evenings to 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7786.943s">We</a> should have people out of their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7789.644s">Because</a> one of the worst things, the perceptions of the police is they're sitting idle in a cruiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7795.065s">People</a> hate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7796.066s">They</a> tell me all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7797.326s">Well,</a> why should I care? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7798.126s">Because</a> they're sitting, look at them, they're playing with their phones in the cruiser, idle, idle. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7802.548s">It's</a> different when they're driving around. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7804.448s">They</a> look busy when they're driving the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7807.17s">But</a> the perception matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7809.031s">Perception</a> will decrease crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7811.433s">They</a> might be busy doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7812.914s">They</a> might be reading about a client, you know, testimony that they're going to be given in a court. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7818.198s">But</a> they don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7819.058s">The</a> person, you know, doesn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7821.56s">And</a> that perception matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7823.802s">Second,</a> we are underutilizing trained officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7826.904s">We</a> do have and we're boring them to death on details. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7831.69s">In</a> the name of a 15% kickback, nobody wants to talk about this, it's a sore spot for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7839.773s">National</a> Grid pays us for that detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7844.274s">We</a> rent out our cops, we rent out our police officers to stand over that hole, whether it's National Grid, Comcast, whatever it might be, and we rent them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7852.737s">We</a> like that because that's where they make their extra money so we don't have to pay them higher salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7858.199s">They</a> deserve higher salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7859.479s">I</a> think they should just have higher salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7862.165s">But</a> the way the mayor gets around that is he has them work a detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7867.427s">And</a> the real frosting on the cake for us is not only does the city save money by giving them the details so that they don't have to pay them a higher salary, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7880.572s">The</a> frosting is that we get a 15% kickback. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7884.154s">We</a> get 15% back on that detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7887.555s">Well,</a> that might have been fine in 1980 in Medford, but it's not suitable to use our cops that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7893.738s">We're</a> burning them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7894.538s">We're</a> boring them to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7895.879s">They're</a> on their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7896.759s">They're</a> looking at their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7899.24s">And</a> they're standing over the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7900.301s">The</a> job is to protect the workers, not to really police the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7905.236s">People</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7905.957s">They</a> think that they're there for the traffic, but they're really there to protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7908.719s">They're</a> being paid by National Grid to protect the workers of National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7912.323s">Oh,</a> I— Not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7913.644s">Too</a> long?
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7914.985s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7916.713s">Federal,</a> let me see here, okay, for the average observer, their experience of seeing a Medford police officer standing over the hole is the worst thing that we can do for perception. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7929.439s">This</a> does not create sympathy for the officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7932.321s">The</a> mayor doesn't stop, if the mayor doesn't stop that practice because of the loss of their revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7938.504s">Okay,</a> I talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7939.619s">Federal</a> deficits and debt are going to continue to climb in the grant-rich environment that was once in abundance will continue to dry up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7948.605s">School</a> aid and community aid programs will fall short of their previous numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7952.947s">Sooner</a> rather than later, the old fight will ensue over hiring to keep a classroom size down or to hire a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7962.773s">The</a> police officer loses to a kid every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7966.673s">Yet</a> if one of these kids comes in school with a knife or a gun, who will they call but a cop, a police officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7974.076s">And</a> that cop won't be there for your kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7979.319s">If</a> the people of the city do not get in front of the crime and safety, it will consume more lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7986.002s">Wishing</a> in a way will not make it so. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7988.603s">Building</a> code enforcement, I talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7991.324s">And</a> now I'm going to talk about another topic that is hard to handle, illegal immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7997.412s">Illegal</a> immigrants both live inside city limits and enter the city limits every day to shingle a roof, to paint a room, to cut grass, or clean a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8007.955s">The</a> police, if no others— Ms.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8014.096s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8014.697s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8015.217s">Oh,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8015.857s">You</a> got a point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8017.017s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8017.777s">Well,</a> anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8018.718s">But,</a> well, it is the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8020.718s">It</a> is the police because the police, if no others, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8024.395s">should</a> have the right to know that they are living here or coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8029.077s">Because</a> they, too, suffer from domestic violence, sex trafficking, or gang violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8036.08s">So</a> it's in their own interest as well as us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8039.101s">Whatever</a> the policy is, they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8042.222s">And</a> how are we going to deal with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8043.703s">And</a> the police, I don't need to know they're here, but the police need to know they're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8051.834s">All</a> right, police officers are authorized to use deadly force and therefore need to be in check with their emotions at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8058.64s">We</a> need to ensure an absolute locked record for therapy for those officers seeking help before they do something unhealthy to themselves or others. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8067.086s">To</a> think that they can do their jobs and not be impacted by it is ludicrous. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8071.89s">However,</a> should they act out in violence inappropriately toward family or others, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8076.667s">They</a> should be monitored closely and held to a higher standard because they have the authority to use lethal force. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8082.529s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8098.813s">I'm</a> not saying that.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8106.601s">And</a> I, no offense, I have a right to say it.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8115.407s">This</a> is the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8116.807s">Because</a> if you don't have enough officers and you don't treat them right, if we don't treat the officers right, then they are more inclined to have that stress build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8124.39s">They</a> can't strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8126.511s">They</a> cannot strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8127.331s">So</a> how do they relieve that stress? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8129.452s">It</a> builds up and it builds up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8130.892s">It</a> comes out on somebody on the street, comes out some way.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8141.176s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8142.656s">I'm</a> not saying they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8143.577s">They</a> should. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8144.277s">And</a> that's great.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8188.406s">It</a> is just, I'm sorry, can I? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8189.886s">No,</a> no, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8190.787s">All</a> of the above. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8191.467s">It's</a> a comprehensive program, and we know <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8195.95s">that</a> when you put someone under that kind of stress and you give them that much authority, they can abuse that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8202.514s">I'm</a> not saying they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8203.775s">I'm</a> not saying they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8204.895s">But</a> I am saying that if you continue to put them under pressure, everybody has a snapping point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8210.919s">And</a> we should really build up any kind of training program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8216.229s">We</a> should add more to it so that doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8218.97s">Because</a> this city is turning more and more into an urban environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8222.612s">It's</a> not going suburban. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8224.193s">It's</a> going more urban. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8225.834s">And</a> we need to be on top of that before something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8229.956s">And</a> I just feel very strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8232.597s">So</a> I understand you want to, you know, I understand that the police have programs, but we really need to be on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8240.58s">I</a> want to increase the numbers, and I don't want to misuse them.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8245.464s">Yes,</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8246.905s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8296.243s">And</a> I would want to say one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8297.864s">The</a> people of Medford should be here saying what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8301.926s">They</a> should be here again petitioning for more police officers for the very reasons that I laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8307.69s">And</a> maybe you didn't agree with all my reasons, but it doesn't matter because I'm a person and a city person, a citizen, and I represent some of those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8316.194s">I</a> represent myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8317.375s">So</a> if I'm one out of 57,000, that's my choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8321.598s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8323.739s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8426.572s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8427.032s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8428.913s">I</a> went to the Washington Disabled Americans for Life Memorial this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8433.555s">It</a> was beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8434.175s">It</a> was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8434.696s">It</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8435.456s">The</a> sky was blue, it was fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8440.359s">2,300</a> people were there, and most of them were disabled veterans and their wives and husbands. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8448.043s">President</a> Obama spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8449.624s">He</a> was very sober when he spoke because, anyway, he was very sober. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8454.446s">There</a> was a couple of unique stories, which is Jesse Brown, who was a disabled veteran, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8459.549s">African</a> American veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8462.651s">The</a> Vietnam veterans, because of Agent Orange, are dying at rapid rates compared to their World War II counterparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8469.153s">He</a> was 68 years old when he died. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8472.535s">He</a> started this project in 1998. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8475.676s">He</a> did not live to see the fruition of his labors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8479.198s">And</a> another man, Sinise, Gary Sinise, who played Lieutenant Dan in the movie Forrest Gump, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8489.52s">was</a> an advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8490.52s">His</a> brother-in-law, he was touched by the story of his brother-in-law in the 1970s. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8494.362s">His</a> brother-in-law died this week at 68 of cancers related to Agent Orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8500.764s">So</a> that was sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8502.344s">There</a> was a woman that was a sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8505.085s">She</a> paid $10 million out of her own pocket for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8508.766s">In</a> the 1960s, she was a musical dancer in New York, in Times Square, and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8518.436s">and</a> she was asked to sing to the troops in the VA. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8523.679s">She</a> went there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8524.239s">She</a> was devastated from what she saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8526.34s">She</a> was singing the song in West Side Story, Take My Hand and We'll Be Halfway There. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8532.783s">She</a> went to reach out for a soldier's hand and it wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8535.685s">She</a> said that if she could ever do anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8538.692s">In</a> her lifetime, she would, and she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8541.114s">She</a> donated $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8542.255s">It</a> was a beautiful story. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8544.557s">And</a> the DAV fundraising that we did the other week was $1,300, a little over $1,300 for the one weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8552.464s">So</a> I would like to thank, and I would like to announce that that is not the DAV's money, that is veterans' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8557.968s">And</a> if anybody has a Medford resident or a spouse or a child of a disabled veteran, they are all qualified <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8567.54s">to</a> receive help in the form of an electric bill, heat bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8572.361s">So</a> if you have a widow that is having a hard time, you have them call me and I can help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8577.703s">I</a> will not give them the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8579.424s">I</a> can pay the bill for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8582.285s">And</a> that's with that $1,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8584.452s">And</a> that money is for all Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8587.514s">It</a> can be used for others, but it's for Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8589.856s">If</a> you have a veteran that can't make it to the hospital, call me and we can help pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8594.559s">We</a> can also do food by giving them a Stop and Shop gift card or some kind of, we can't give them the money, but we can go to Stop and Shop and can you give us a voucher for $50, $100, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8605.947s">So</a> we can do that with that money, so thank you.

 <p>[Jeanne Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1774.783s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1775.503s">Gene</a> Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1778.125s">And</a> very similar to the way that the Medford housing is a separate but connected entity, so is TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1786.227s">I</a> received the Judge Jackson report from our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1791.249s">So</a> our city solicitor has involvement with TV3 on some level. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1798.111s">And</a> so I think that there is a coupling and an overlap between Medford, Medford residents and TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1803.553s">So</a> it is our asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1805.393s">It</a> is our asset and it should be used hand in glove with the Chevalier Auditorium and with the Condon Shell and all of the rest of the arts community <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1815.223s">And</a> at best, and I'm glad Mr. Palleri is here in the room, because he's the one that can answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1823.987s">At</a> best, there's mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1826.228s">I'm</a> not accusing anybody of anything illegal or inappropriate, but at best, this channel is being mismanaged at such an incredible level that if $5,000 was missing from Bank of America, somebody would be paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1846.037s">So</a> there is no station currently working right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1851.363s">We</a> need that station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1852.444s">We</a> need it as a public voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1853.625s">But</a> $200,000 a year they get, and I want to know where the money is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1860.612s">$200,000</a> from everyone that pays a Verizon bill or a Comcast bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1865.581s">And</a> it's called the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1867.223s">It's</a> on the back of your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1868.564s">I</a> thank you very much for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1870.206s">This</a> is a huge issue in the culture of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1874.169s">MedFed's</a> ability to connect for <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1877.841s">videotaping</a> hockey games, football games, political events, the memorial service that we had yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1886.025s">It</a> is part of the vibrancy that could be part of MedFed and MedFed's future. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1890.567s">And</a> why it's not up and running? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1893.529s">If</a> it's not up and running, it's completely being mismanaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1896.911s">And</a> not for nothing, but somebody should be replaced or removed, not in any bad way, but just because they're incompetent. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1906.678s">is</a> incompetent at Channel 3, that's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1909.819s">And</a> if the mayor cannot adjust that, if the mayor cannot take care of this problem, then we need to go to the FCC or whatever other authorities have control over TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1922.044s">It</a> could be the FCC, it could be the tax code because they're a non-profit, whoever it is that's the outside authorities, because the mayor has not taken care of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1932.569s">With</a> all due respect, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1934.5s">The</a> mayor has not taken care of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1936.121s">It's</a> been going on for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1938.603s">And</a> if you look at all of the past meetings that we've had in city council, and you can go on YouTube and find them and just put in TV3 or Mr. Penter or my name or some other councilor's name, and you will get the YouTubes of the topics being brought up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1957.625s">Let's</a> have a respectful TV3 channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1960.727s">Let's</a> fire somebody if that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1962.848s">And</a> I'm not accusing them of anything illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1964.989s">I</a> am accusing them of incompetence, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1968.591s">Without</a> a doubt, somebody has been incompetent in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1971.632s">And</a> I'll do respect to Mr. Poleri. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1973.974s">But</a> somebody needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1976.395s">Thank</a> you.
