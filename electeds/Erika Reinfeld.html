    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=2411.265s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, did you have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4682.571s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was wondering if you could speak to how unique this process is for schools in particular, because I think to Tracy's point about community questions about why did it happen this way, and people's reference point is likely other construction projects that they've been involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4700.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so is this typical across building projects, or is this really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4706.059s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: a singular experience for the MSBA process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4708.581s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe Marissa can answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4714.344s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: When my work was rebuilt, this happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4716.465s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And this is what is going to be inundated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg7MfqcnomU&t=4719.907s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm curious if you can, in a nutshell,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1203.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this sounds incredibly exciting, and I love the timeline, not just because I also have an eighth grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1209.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious how the begin work immediately in June lines up with community input, particularly given that summer is a vacation time and our educators are gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1219.219s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know there's an architectural selection and that probably needs to happen before we get the community involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1223.941s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But when can we expect those sorts of conversations and meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1277.256s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely, and I know you have a subcommittee for engagement and communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1333.949s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much for laying that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1336.77s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1462.82s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If you're definitely going, you should be the alternate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1707.635s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1708.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So one of the things we hear a lot is, what do I expect when there's an after school lottery or when my child is coming to kindergarten or moving up to sixth grade or to eighth grade and I think the district has done a really nice job and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1723.848s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: bringing on a director of communications to centralize some of the communications coming out of the central leadership, but I think we do better in some areas than others when it comes to communicating expectations about transitions for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1741.317s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: knowing that we have a director of communications now, and we recognize some of the things that are always going to need to be communicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1749.701s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, there are program specific things that need to come from a program in the moment, but I think overall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1756.704s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we are at a point where we can really start to put together some frequently asked questions and some schedules that can be communicated to families in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1764.83s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I would just like to have a deeper conversation and bring Director Pappichelli into that conversation to discuss how his position can support some of these very broad communications that affect a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1835.045s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I will just add this isn't to take authority away from people who are doing communication, but it's to support them in that work and to, I think this meeting could also give some of our families a chance to communicate to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1848.757s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know you heard a lot of it at the meet and greets, but what they would like to know what they're expecting so we can be ahead of that and not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1859.513s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have all of our folks on the ground, spending all their time answering questions about things that could have been communicated in advance so that they could focus on doing the work and executing on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1932.42s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think this mostly speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1934.001s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is kind of a trumped up version of our don't run out of paper resolution that I think we passed this time last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1940.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But, and I, I do apologize because I know it is work to put together those school supply lists because they do change from year to year and I hate putting more work on school staff in this busy time, but I think it's really important that we give our families and indeed are the people in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1955.335s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: As much lead time as possible to pull together what they need for academic success in the new year when in the new academic year when we don't necessarily know what's coming down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1989.144s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That was actually, I was going to mention that because I know that class selections are still being made and we're still figuring out what the offerings are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=1996.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I would look to you to advise on how best<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2042.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was thinking that gives us, because normally I think the lists go home on the last day of school in elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2048.173s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They typically, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2049.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: At least that's when I've gotten them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2050.855s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll just say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2181.131s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2181.971s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I normally don't like the vague language of as soon as possible or at earliest convenience, but I think that's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2188.733s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I accept that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2192.734s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=379.246s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What's the history of increases here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=451.543s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Am I right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=459.325s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=460.205s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was also wondering how this matches up with some of the right sizing we've been doing on our budget over the last couple of years with our revolving accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=468.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's a question for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=471.035s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: budget analyst Gerry McCue, but that is my question around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=521.249s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, because I'm curious what I know that was one of the accounts that has had a lot of movement over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=889.167s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=998.987s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this is a very fancy way of saying our elementary schools are overcrowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1002.549s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We need to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1003.769s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What this began as a resolution to undertake those solutions, but very quickly evolved into a report to assemble the data so we can really understand the nature of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1016.515s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the problems and the challenges we're facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1018.476s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I apologize, this probably should have been submitted as a report request by the time I was done writing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1026.061s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But the community, the principals, everyone has come to us, we know this is a challenge, and everyone has an idea of how it ought to be fixed, whether that's through redistricting, restructuring,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1039.54s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: changing how we select students per elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1043.622s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I would like for the district to begin that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1049.065s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we've just had a lot of schedule changes that we've had to implement very quickly, but this is a pressing problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1054.988s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And there are two stages to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1056.548s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One is to figure out the long-term solutions based on the data that we have, but we also have a very urgent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1063.732s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: issue of potential kindergarten admissions exacerbating this problem for the upcoming school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1070.333s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm looking for some short-term solutions as well as some long-term solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1075.274s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think the district has a lot of this data and can present the challenge and potential solutions before choosing one to really investigate further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1086.497s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's the goal of this is to begin the process of solving our overcrowding issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1106.611s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1111.635s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1230.253s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm certainly open to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1231.634s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am also on that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1233.977s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'll be getting that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1235.839s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I might<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1237.295s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: confirm with colleagues who are not, I think any, all right, I'm seeing some unofficial signals that that feels okay, so yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1248.882s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And my question to the superintendent is, would we need, because that's strategic planning for the longterm, would there need to be, looking at the elementary school for next year, would that need to come to this group sooner, or would that need to go to family engagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1285.734s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it possible to have that conversation about elementary without having had the bigger conversation in the subcommittee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1293.18s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm thinking about timing here and the May 19th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1370.11s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1370.531s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Then I will accept the amendment to bring it to strategic planning, but I would defer to the superintendent and the team if this piece of it needs to come on the agenda sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1388.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, accordingly, when the data is ready, we can schedule strategic planning and see how the kindergarten situation fits into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1395.218s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, we've been closely monitoring everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=1397.019s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5742.276s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I echo all of the thanks and appreciation for the work that's happening and I want to extend it to the members of the community, students, teachers, parents, voters, who allowed us to have these conversations about what we can do for students and with students, rather than what we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5762.839s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: a much more encouraging budget process and negotiation that we were able to do this quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5770.643s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that is because people in the community put their trust in our schools, our administration, our teachers, just everyone involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5781.468s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I just wanted to thank the members of the community and the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5785.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This couldn't have been possible without the override funds and a commitment to putting students first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5791.113s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6651.204s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6654.625s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Dr. Cushing, I'm hoping you can tell us a little bit about the consultation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6658.367s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know a lot of thought went into designating holidays and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6663.937s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm hoping you can talk about how communities were consulted about the possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6669.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had a lot of conversations with people when we were reviewing last year's calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6677.064s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can speak to one religion more than others, as I imagine many people here can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6777.754s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Not counting against their bank?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6814.162s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hence the motion to discuss further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6817.064s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I also support triangle and I'd be interested to see how that goes to inform future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6825.569s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll defer to colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6892.782s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6896.107s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I was just going to say, I know that we in our schools do need to really make sure that those major assignments and tests are not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6906.571s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And to be aware of the burden that can be on students to notify teachers that this is a holiday for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6914.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It is sometimes challenging for students, not all students, but those students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6922.758s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: who are not comfortable putting themselves out there in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6926.461s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I certainly hear from people that having teachers be ready and aware and not making it a big deal will be really important, as well as the other student acceptance of marginalized religions in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6945.537s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think in terms of choosing which holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6947.418s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The other piece here is what actually happens during the observance right the observance of Yom Kippur is a fast based fasting holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6954.203s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's very different than Rosh Hashanah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6956.505s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I appreciate that consideration in this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6961.228s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7147.938s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Let's see, Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7150.973s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um, this to clarify, I just seconded this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7154.555s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7155.055s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is to discuss both the changes recommended by Dr Cushing and the holidays in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7160.758s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7161.218s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7161.839s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um, in that case, I would want to make sure that we invited, um, faith leaders and representatives from to attend this meeting, explicitly inviting them, not just making it known that this policy, the subcommittee is meeting chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7179.101s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7188.845s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I watched that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7190.525s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I did watch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7851.57s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7852.431s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So you answered my first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7853.792s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My second one was what was the previous, what have the increases been like previous, what's the history?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=3781.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have the same question, but I also wanted to confirm that if somebody has initial feedback on what they're looking for in the role but does not want to serve on the committee they should still answer, they should still respond to that survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=3794.18s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think if you do a second push, it would be really useful to put that in there because I certainly read that as, if you want to be a part of the committee, that's what the survey is for, rather than also feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4251.998s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member, Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4258.293s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would just amend, replace further considerations and next steps with additional considerations, since it's a policy and not on the top of page three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4272.888s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not part of the policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4275.59s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4276.932s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe that was a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4290.343s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I guess the question is, where is this page three content available for people to view?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4308.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think since this addresses questions that the community had about students in particular situations, like transfer students, significant needs, et cetera, it should be available and easy to find place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4321.219s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4500.352s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One more amendment is just to add eligibility for a diploma under the post-2024 requirements so that it's explicit that this is about the diploma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4512.316s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Last bullet point to assess eligibility for a diploma under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4524.714s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Eligibility for a diploma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4530.696s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I will stop amending things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4535.517s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, you'll get me next week, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5260.067s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5261.749s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5263.563s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, my question was related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5265.283s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You said this could be added on if we see costs are coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5268.524s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If we, say, decide that we want to do this, is this estimate going significant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5275.785s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we cannot always predict what the markets are going to do, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5280.346s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But is there a significant risk in waiting to do a solar addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5286.047s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5301.828s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What I'm trying to avoid is six months from now going, oh, we should have authorized this six months ago, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5309.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5391.028s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you and I appreciate locking things in because this has to get done before our kids go back to school in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5397.893s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This has to happen over the summer so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5436.135s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I say we move, but I know my colleague has a... I'm going to go to Dr. Galusi and then member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6098.622s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6099.282s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6101.68s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would just add to that, that the state provides limited flexibility in some areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6106.244s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think it's really important where there is some flexibility to increase, as member Graham said, options for students and provide students with the autonomy to do the things that they are passionate about and really make electives things that they elect to do while still meeting basic health and academic requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6128.582s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know our various departments have done a lot of work to build really wonderful electives in a lot of different areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=6135.364s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want as many students to be able to access those as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2509.698s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2510.498s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll echo the thanks to the finance department and to everyone who contributed to this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2515.38s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My question is, is there an anticipated time frame for looking, I know you said we're not adding any building-based positions, and I understand that in the sense of how much uncertainty there is and not wanting to make promises that we can't keep in terms of the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2532.408s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know there are adjustments that get made as enrollment is projected enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2537.033s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We'll see what the enrollment actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2539.276s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we have been trying very hard to get the message out around kindergarten, but we often see an influx later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2545.963s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then, of course, you knew I was going to say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2548.186s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have concerns about the guidance levels at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2553.011s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: like I said, I understand they're not adding positions this time, but is there a time frame when we would look at that and see if that is really needed and be able to add those positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2566.175s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Especially as contract, as we understand what the collective bargaining comes to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2619.113s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We look at new schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2620.353s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I could imagine needing staff to support those different, those changes or ongoing uncertainty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fyxDl0MdF_A&t=2629.655s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3353.168s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3355.33s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3356.351s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3357.432s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was I found it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3360.054s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had to look up a few words, but not too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3362.156s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3363.597s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a hyper local local question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3365.559s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering if on the city side, we're going to see some non standard increases in departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3372.705s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My understanding is some of the city departments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3377.966s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're a little restrained last time in order to fill some gaps in the school budget, which I very much appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3383.736s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm wondering if we're going to see those come back of people who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3389.512s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: unevenly increasing within the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3392.933s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That might be a question for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3394.453s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It might also be premature, but I know some of the departments in the city, I don't wanna say sacrificed, but their ask wasn't as big because we had some significant gaps in the school budget to fill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3408.996s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know the override covered some of those, but I'm curious what the impact is gonna be on the allocations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3539.596s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3540.016s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then, of course, there's the outstanding question that I know nobody can answer about what the federal landscape is going to look like and what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3548.478s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: is going to come or not come to the city, what compensations the states have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3553.021s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And of course, we'll be talking with the school finance director about contingencies and what things look like within the school budget, because we get obviously a lot of federal grants and a lot of federal aid and questions around, is this going to be a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3569.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: if we end up, find ourselves with less money, is this going to be an across the board reduction or is it going to be targeted to particular areas if we have to make those decisions, which I very much hope we don't, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3581.292s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But just recognizing that on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=3608.773s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=104.976s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=653.271s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Unless that's a problem because I have a child with the Roberts, but I assume that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1104.832s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Jerry, do you want us to save questions till the end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1124.522s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And sorry, while I'm here, will we get a copy of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=1127.183s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think it was in our- Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2111.22s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, just to clarify, that's the balance, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2113.021s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's not the spending on it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2120.062s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=2137.561s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, I just wanted to make sure that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5378.015s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Will we get this list that you just went through here as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5381.979s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That would be really helpful to see what people want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5394.12s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Even just this tab, I think, would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5397.784s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5400.826s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMjhyZWt-ek&t=5435.293s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a motion to enter executive session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2790.37s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2791.71s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think my hand is the same color as my wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2795.991s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what happens if demand exceeds supply on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2801.253s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is super exciting, and I think a lot of people will be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2803.834s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think there are some really real financial challenges for equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2809.639s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what's the protocol?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2820.511s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If more people want to do this then there is room for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2824.996s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do you have to be a host family to be an exchange family or just for your student to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2830.802s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2892.217s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, it is a very competitive price from what I've seen of Europe, but it is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2927.966s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was just wondering if what if more people want to go than there are more than 15 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2998.962s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That age prioritization was, I think, what I was getting at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3003.204s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4131.192s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe I'll switch to the default yellow instead of my accurate skin tone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4136.617s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Could you clarify what the role is in terms of special projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4142.984s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know there's mention of maintaining the capital plan and relationships with vendors, but when we approved the assistance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4153.323s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: facilities director as part of the override allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4157.087s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Part of the motivation for that was we knew that the district was going to be entering into a number of special projects, not just the new high school, but with the capital plan that we have approved as a committee, we know there are going to be select projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4172.181s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You mentioned HVAC, but we know that's not the only one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4175.164s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We know there are things coming up and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4178.783s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would, maybe it's a bullet point just on special projects, but I wasn't sure exactly is it the facilities manager, is it the assistant facilities manager who's going to be serving as the liaison to the vendor, the OPM, the project manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4196.245s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think if that is an explicit responsibility of being the point of contact or the team lead within the district for these new construction projects, these big maintenance projects, not just ongoing maintenance, I think that needs to be called out more clearly in one or both of the job descriptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4214.989s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I wasn't quite sure which one that was landing on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4226.015s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: into which job description should a bullet point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4232.037s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4236.159s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, are they both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4238.32s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it at the discretion of the facilities director to delegate that to an assistant facilities person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4245.482s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know there was a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4247.323s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4249.364s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to see that reflected in one or both of these descriptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4543.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is this another other duties as assigned needed here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4547.947s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4548.568s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We know that this is going to grow or evolve, maybe not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4577.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then assist with collective bargaining and administer all contracts involving the facilities department staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4583.088s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it really just the custodians versus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4591.692s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If this person is responsible for the custodians and not other management, I'm not sure it's appropriate to be administering contracts not related to custodial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4607.517s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You tell me how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4622.507s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So maybe it's assist with collective bargaining and administration of all contracts of rather than the administer verb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4630.872s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4633.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: a little bit semantic, but this person is not responsible for fully to administer it, to assist and administer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4642.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They're assisting with the bargaining and administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5557.757s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive the full reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5561.259s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There's a lot of numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5580.707s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, the change on this was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5770.62s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5878.356s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5879.056s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5881.078s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5881.638s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And thanks to my colleagues for considering these resolutions, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5885.7s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Our job is of course to set policy and this resolution isn't setting policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5890.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's simply affirming the existing policy and directs the superintendent to continue existing practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5896.847s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I just wanted to talk very, very, as briefly as I can about why this is on the agenda, particularly since it echoes the guidance that Dr. Galusi has already sent to district staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5906.933s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: and a statement that the Acting Commissioner of Education for Massachusetts put out a few weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5913.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is on the agenda in partly in response to concerns from students, teachers, some students' families wondering whether things like our GSAs and respectful pronoun use and language in academic and administrative forms and protection from bullying and harassment are going away<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5931.224s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: in light of the political climate, just want to say, no, they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5935.187s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But also this is on the agenda because there is a pattern in history and in communities more broadly of using marginalized populations as a test balloon for trampling of individual rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5947.856s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I don't need to dwell on that, but I think this is why I, or really we felt that this was important to draw a line now and state this publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5959.725s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I also just wanted to note that we did separate out sexual orientation from gender identity because there are different risks, vulnerabilities, really, that come with those different identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5971.632s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that's worth acknowledging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5974.793s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But ultimately, this is about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5976.848s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Belonging right learning does not happen unless people feel safe and safety requires a sense of belonging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5983.375s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, I, I think we do have a few students on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5987.66s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think there may be some people watching on YouTube and just to say, we celebrate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5992.805s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5994.847s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: and everyone belongs in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5998.09s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a couple of language changes I would like to put questioning back into that first sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6004.477s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we missed a couple of the policies around harassment and retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6010.823s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Just so just to add those to the list of MPS policies, but these exist, these laws have not changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6016.869s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We welcome our queer and gender nonconforming students and staff, families, and I think it's worth saying publicly here and now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6027.304s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Olapade, I don't know if you wanted to add to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6186.161s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's in the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6192.417s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the ACAB policies and one of the JB policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6205.3s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This one has a language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6225.228s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Mayor, you're muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6432.059s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Olapade, did you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6433.918s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6520.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to again echo what Member Olapade said, but to note that this comes a little bit out of an executive order from the end of January, from about a month ago about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6536.021s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: ending radical indoctrination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6537.582s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think that is what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6539.583s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is why we are supporting the district's commitment to educational materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6545.966s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's also coming out of the Texas and Becerra case, which if people are not familiar with this, this is speaking to remove section 504 compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6557.771s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think it's important that people know that these are some of the things that are happening<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6564.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: here, and then I just also wanted to note that the, again, the laws have not changed here executive orders are not laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6573.299s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This court case is pending, but things like I've spent I spent a fair bit of time with the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6579.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Harvard affirmative action case and while race as a lone determinant was determined, was the Supreme Court handed down a verdict that said that was not a basis, that decision does actually affirm that lived experience and how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6598.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: identity characteristics, including race, inform your educational experience and your opportunity is in fact a reasonable basis for making decisions about what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6609.967s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: belongs in policies and classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6613.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it is worth noting that these are laws that are in place and that they do, as member Olapade said, seek to expand and maintain opportunity and ensure that people are able to reach their full potential and be reflected in the learning environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6778.052s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I think our... I think today is our March 10th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1834.71s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was potentially going to motion to take 2025-03 out of order, because that either seems to be a sending this to the subcommittee or just updating the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1846.918s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I see this is coming up on the agenda, but maybe Member Ruseau could clarify whether this is a policy update or a recommendation to send it to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3402.575s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I agree with that and the reason behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3405.115s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My only question is whether that poses a, if we're looking to be opening registration in January, are we concerned that that would affect people's ability to commit or our ability to guarantee a spot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3478.234s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Will this opening of registration coincide with other summer programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3482.616s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if jumpstart dates are set or other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5752.275s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was also going to ask about financial aid or sliding scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5755.258s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I support that as seeing that model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5759.041s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I would actually like to see more of a differential between the resident and Medford school staff rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5770.47s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And non-residents, the rec center program is 250, Power Kids is 315, and then I believe Six Acres is 850 for two weeks, which turns into 425 for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5783.033s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so looking at our numbers here, I think particularly for non-residents, we can definitely push that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5794.311s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: when we want to be prioritizing the people in Medford and Medford schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5836.38s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I also just wanted to add, I think the CIT program is a fantastic addition, and I love that for our older students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5843.361s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I support having things be a little higher so that we can pay our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5848.542s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So finding that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5849.923s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I do think we can have a bigger delta between in Medford and out of Medford residents, although it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5857.524s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was that 10 students per week, or was that over the course of the whole summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7372.825s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld and then Member Intapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7375.725s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I have another amendment to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7377.846s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to add in between the access to school premises and dismissal of students language about bus encounters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7387.729s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if the encounter involves school sponsored transportation, bus drivers and monitors shall take the following steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7394.13s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One, do not discharge students until instructed to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7397.171s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Two, do not allow the agents onto the bus until instructed to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7402.173s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Three, request identification from the agents and a copy of any judicial warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7406.435s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Four, immediately contact the superintendent's office for further instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7410.396s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And five, contact the transportation office to document the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7414.197s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Again, this is the practice that is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7417.038s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It mirrors the language of entry into school premises, but our student-provided transportation is an area that we also need to include in this, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7438.126s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do you want this language to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7442.369s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7444.271s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7695.773s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7698.55s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I will also say there is some significance to today being Holocaust Remembrance Day, and I would actually love to have this passed on this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5040.401s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for this overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5041.641s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think I was the one who initially wanted this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5044.722s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And one thing that I don't see a lot of here and I imagine will be coming up in presumably that some of it is going to be addressed in the supplemental proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5054.365s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But part of the reason for this report was to inform the fiscal year 26<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5059.887s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: budgets, particularly around the impact on students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5063.468s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know at the elementary level, it ended up tweaking some of the class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5069.13s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Middle schools, I'm still concerned about the loss of the guidance Councilors and bringing that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5074.552s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think I have a middle schooler I've seen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5079.235s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's working, but I think we've lost some of the aspects of student support because these guidance Councilors are spending their whole time teaching, and it's affecting also other classes in teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5093.061s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm hoping to see a little more information about the impact on the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5099.844s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham mentioned what was happening with the administrative assistance and the, you know, these stipends were, I talked to a few of the people who received the stipends to cover some of the responsibilities from the Director of Professional Learning and Assessment, and that seems to be working reasonably well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5120.289s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious where you see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5122.59s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: needing to invest in fiscal year 26 for some of the less budgetary impacts, but the student experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5241.042s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5241.542s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's useful to hear kind of what are the urgent needs that are being addressed by this immediate infusion of override funds, but to note that this is still a conversation that we're having about the next budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5266.488s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6635.815s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: clarifying question on the restoring of the administrative system at McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6640.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Will that end up being two administrative assistants for two schools or will it be one per school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6645.393s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it designated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6652.283s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know people fill in for their person next to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6669.963s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6670.843s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley covered my other clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6673.464s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then one last one, you mentioned that the administrative floater had been supporting food services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6678.145s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're not leaving food services in the lurch by transferring that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6681.946s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6706.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6706.625s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to make sure we were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7416.826s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was just hoping you could speak a little more about the logistics of how funds reserved for bargaining for a future contract gets spent in the bargaining fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7429.575s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You alluded to it for a couple of these items, but just explaining how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=237.753s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7199.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, minor quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7201.745s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: When will the McGlynn schematic get to 100%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7203.947s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How does that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7291.566s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure this isn't going to introduce some new delays unexpectedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7296.128s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7296.388s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is how this timeline is built is to do it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7299.428s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I'm wondering if you can comment on the in-classroom experience in the hot months of May and June and what are we looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7308.61s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't have a great solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7309.971s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7326.482s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: May and June have not been... Well, we usually have like two to five really brutal days and that's when everyone gets hot and angry, hot and bothered, should we say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7392.648s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just, I wanna be ready and anticipating what things are gonna be like and being able to tell people, this is why it is this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7953.618s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To be clear, I am in favor of approving it, but I think it's useful to have the context of what was discussed in the capital planning meetings because we were supposed to have had that last week and have that context for the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7968.283s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I'm on that subcommittee, so I know what's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7972.124s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I guess maybe I'd defer to the people who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7976.87s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I am in favor of doing it tonight, but I think it's useful to have the context of that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8048.255s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Director McCue is ready, so I withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9583.026s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How does that coincide with the lifetime?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9589.571s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And it was a reasonable proportion of the freight motor lifetime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9594.295s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It wasn't like, oh, we're getting 1% of its valuable lifetime by doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9598.278s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It did line up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=194.707s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to relay from a comment that I received from the public of looking for somebody who's going to prioritize some of whom maybe are more vulnerable populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=205.912s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know that is something that Dr. Edouard-Vincent was very committed to as well, but to really make that explicit, that we are potentially looking at a fair bit of turmoil as changing federal and state regulations come down, filter down to local districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=222.999s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=224.199s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: being on top of that and aware of how it affects the wide range of populations within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=496.513s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Galusi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=580.122s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=602.709s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=213.835s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6629.004s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's how I read the motion here is to create a job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6634.702s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: for somebody who will work in collaboration with the city and propose the stipend for Director Nwaje to continue the work through the fiscal year in a consulting stipend basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6646.117s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that is how I'm reading this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10446.908s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You mentioned renovation couldn't get something up to ADA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10451.031s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can you confirm that we do have ADA accessible bathrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10454.653s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10485.379s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So not necessarily convenient for people who need them, but they are on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10491.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12140.012s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to know either at the second reading or as a result of the investigation, just who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12146.238s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: where the responsibility is going to lie for doing that testing because this most recent round of testing obviously was through the program that we are now no longer eligible for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12155.002s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, we're eligible for the grants to update the drinking stations, but we can't, we won't be having the state come in and do this testing to the level that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12164.347s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't need it codified, but I would like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12166.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to know who's going, where that responsibility will lie, but I will second the motion to approve the first reading on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=615.207s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, just to refresh, the funding source for that, some of it is allocated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=621.829s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Where's that coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=623.589s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=628.071s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we didn't have the final number until recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.286s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.626s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.826s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know we had designated some things for HVAC, but it's all bonded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=671.487s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=729.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does that make sense so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=731.326s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=736.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.914s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1064.5s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1065.502s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1088.53s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And are those, do you know, are those typically funded at the full cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1092.693s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1159.582s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with similar efforts parallel efforts in other city buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1246.1s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1248.221s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1249.242s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1270.315s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1493.838s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1494.258s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1675.891s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1681.074s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Did we get an answer on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1683.875s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1761.33s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And former member McLaughlin had mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1766.374s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: a grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1771.278s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1776.022s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's something that we can revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1778.284s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1783.889s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Dr. Cushing, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1794.19s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1798.911s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we couldn't get the application in one year, and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1875.881s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And who's we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1915.48s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Then let me ask a clarifying question about these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1920.544s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are we out of compliance or are we in danger of being out of compliance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1953.583s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And are the fixes that are costed out here, I know the range is big,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1959.998s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: will those have sufficient longevity that we won't need to be looking at this again in the immediate future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1966.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's a real fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2166.316s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The Disability Commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2358.897s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2359.758s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I also think we can't be dependent on this grant coming through to get in compliance for accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2366.103s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think this has to be a priority with or without the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2396.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then you asked what else here in the shaded portion is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2400.471s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: When you say the flashing failed, the word failed is always worrisome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2404.274s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What does that mean for those of us who are not stonemasons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2413.179s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and we're fixing that for the roofs on other buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2417.081s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That also feels like a... Mend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2636.133s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Will that come out in this mini recommissioning assessment that we've just split off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3448.02s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yeah, I think so this isn't on the verge of failing or this isn't already failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3652.167s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was going to ask what the timeline for the assessment is, but it sounds like we don't have that number either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3758.442s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3759.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We were in elementary school when we started this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3762.024s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we have what we need to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3766.388s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can't it's up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3768.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it sounds like we have a quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3775.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And is it going to affect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3777.036s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know how long it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3778.157s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3780.459s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are people using the field now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3784.382s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3787.044s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How long does it take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3787.904s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I remember when the Roberts playground drainage issue was happening and kids couldn't play on the playground and I won't mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3817.84s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so this isn't going to disrupt essential recess activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3824.483s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think so, right, Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3833.786s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, and then yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4237.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, three at Andrews, two at McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4398.177s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that goes into in progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5214.535s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll just jump in and say, I do spend a lot of time at the Roberts, given that, well, I only have one kid there now, but there have been residential properties that have now been converted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5228.745s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The available land, whether that was even an option to take for the schools, to purchase for the schools, is a question to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5240.083s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There aren't a lot of properties it's it's very residential it's houses and we put up the, there's a new, there are new condos and then there's an ambiguous construction going on on Park Street and Hickey Park is the closest park and that ends up being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5257.694s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It shouldn't be a 10 minute walk, but it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5259.635s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And it's a 15 minute walk with kindergartners and have to do field trip forms to go to the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5265.519s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They do field day there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5266.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It would be nice to get some kind of connection with Hickey, but it is a few blocks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5272.343s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I do think space is at a premium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5571.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5573.197s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So the question on the table is, are we prioritizing any of these schools for a CPC application this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5580.099s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5777.562s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The other hard conversation, which is not the scope of this meeting, but is how are we managing the unevenness in population in schools across the district, whether that's looking at reorganizing the grade levels, whether it's just redistricting, whether it's somebody come up to me and say, we should just open a new school, which I suppose that's on the table too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5805.2s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's another hard conversation that informs what type of playground we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5809.462s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because if we move to a different model, we may have a different student population in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6014.583s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One of the elementary schools in my hometown did that, but they actually had the whole school underground as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6022.911s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was very cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6023.591s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They had it elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6024.953s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was very cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6027.645s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That was the 60s and 70s that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6031.446s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Weird architectural world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6046.572s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sorry for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6048.972s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We ended the last one early, so this was due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6145.489s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You might want to, picky details, flip Missituk and Brooks, because it sounds like that's the priority order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6185.143s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was just going off the conversation that happened before, but you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6188.184s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We didn't have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6190.044s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6207.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Have we identified all of the, right, this meeting was timed so that we could say this is, I see the potential open space CPC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6215.649s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't see any of that for the current projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6219.892s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Actually, some things had been committed up at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6222.353s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and then we have an application pending for Curtis Tufts, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6232.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6238.666s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think the question is what we're asking school committee to, I guess, is this the work of the district to say what if this is going into a supplemental budget request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6252.392s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What is coming out of funds that have already been allocated and what is a new request to city council or from capital stabilization, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6264.297s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of the mitigation is potentially a stabilization<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6269.841s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6285.674s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also trying to do the math on what the grand total here is, but I don't know that a grand total is what's important so much as the total for each of these buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6390.919s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other element of this process was net school spending, but that's covered under the recommend proceeding in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6443.555s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And what does that mean for something like LED lighting replacement, which ends up being $180,000 across the three schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6489.463s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yep, there's that column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6491.883s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I've zoomed in and I'm scrolling back and forth, so apologies for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6672.569s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need a deadline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6673.93s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know a couple people took action items to confirm quotes or points of contact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6679.315s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there, do you, in preparing that slide, do you need, is there a deadline you want that information by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6684.939s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously we want it as soon as we can get it, but reasonable demands on people's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6696.869s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Till end of next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6706.087s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, nobody's working Thursday, Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6768.058s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6769.599s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6772.801s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6774.281s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=427.305s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=573.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think Member Olapade summarized it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=575.519s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it would be good for this committee to understand what has been happening, what the need is, and what that intersection looks like in terms of building capacity within the district, understanding that there is very particular training that Director Nwaje has that people in the school district don't have, and just really making the best use of people's time and expertise in a really collaborative way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=601.716s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: make sure that everyone who needs to be supported is supported on both sides of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=839.922s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=841.463s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The language in this resolution is very vague, and so I am very eager to know how we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=849.858s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: to know the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=851.139s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you for being here, Frances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1109.403s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, I just, I'm curious, are you a mandated reporter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1590.799s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to ask if you can't do hours, is there a way to estimate what percentage of the time or what I'm trying to do, because we're being asked to put this into the school budget, which I think is a very fair request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1606.311s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so trying to figure out, I know that we can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1610.947s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But a value on this but to figure out in a proportionately and looking across the system at how this how this shakes out in terms of what time the staff would be spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1625.183s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: scrambling around to get answers versus you having answers more at the ready and just kind of the percentage or what this looks like if you know I think we are blessed to have a resource in house like this and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1847.262s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Another question, you mentioned having an idea and coming to discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1854.443s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Again, in the trying to understand what all of this is a resource for and is supporting what that means, what's the balance around things that you are responding to requests from within the school community versus bringing things to the attention versus just the routine follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1910.279s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I ran into Janine when I was on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1915.981s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There are these things that I cannot touch and I should not touch and we absolutely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1984.326s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I think that that was kind of what I was getting at or wondering about at in terms of building capacity within the district because there is so much work we can do on so many of these fronts, whether it's a physical constraint a cultural constraint a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2000.118s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: situational something that arises in terms of being responsive to what's happening, but also building awareness of resources, of best practices, and all of that, both in terms of our administration, but also the staff and the employees more generally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2020.869s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think we have an opportunity, as we say, we have an opportunity to work with Director Nwaje on what DEI looks like in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2029.592s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering what that opportunity is and whether it's, you know, it is, no, it's really, this is about compliance or this is about the opportunity to do more and make our district a better, more welcoming, more compliant place, which I think is something we would all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2049.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: love to do and to have really built into that culture from the moment of onboarding, really from recruitment on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2589.01s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And can I just jump in on that, that culture and retention, it's one thing to get people into the district, having them stay, just to be really explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2599.112s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If there's no belonging, that doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2601.713s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2954.452s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what processes exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2958.362s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know whether the end of this sentence is in our community or in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2964.425s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm interested particularly in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2968.626s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is your support of DEI efforts in the school and ADA efforts in the school, is that to help us develop the systems and processes we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2976.57s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we have those in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2978.47s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Where are we in this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5097.011s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think the thing when you saw me go, is this the right resolution for right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5101.894s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was me saying, is this, we cannot rely on Frances to do all of this work, but we can't have her not do this work either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5111.259s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This collaboration is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5113.88s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I, you know, I put my hat on of going, I went to the strategic plan and I look at all of these objectives and initiatives and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5124.406s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Only some of them are covered, I know they're they're baked into a lot of what we do as a district, but to really put that front and center, understanding who is responsible for these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5137.342s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: in many of these instances, is this a consultation or is this a responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5142.307s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I would like to see these are the responsibilities within the district in doing this work and how that interfaces with this valuable collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5155.558s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I do think extending the partnership, the collaboration makes sense and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5165.524s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What does it mean to take it to the next level of what this looks like on the ground and with the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5172.932s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5210.446s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To continue to extend the stipend through the end of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5215.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, that's already, that's already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5220.493s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, we had approved this through the end of the calendar year, but to move into the fiscal year to maintain the full collaboration at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5232.02s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Now that we have a sense of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5235.729s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what this means in practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5321.593s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The consolidation on building on me, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5375.817s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To be really clear, I don't want to nickel and dime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5378.418s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're not trying to nickel and dime anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5380.38s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're trying to provide fair compensation for work that is important and happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5462.118s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5463.079s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have two more regular meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5474.787s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'll just say that I would like the reality check of is the current stipend in the ballpark?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5485.754s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5488.274s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: because if it needs to be significantly more, I want to know that by December, I'd like to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5507.59s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And if no, rather than we stick with what we have, I think if we can't get a good number in that timeframe, what we have is the best we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5532.536s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I probably, although I'm okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5537.498s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does this does a within district position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5540.879s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does this make sense to the people in this room?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5579.299s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because one of the things I think we heard from Francis early on is this is what this job isn't, or this is what this consultation and this partnership is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5587.481s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I heard this group say, those are also things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5593.203s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Those are ands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5595.703s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: not oars, but hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5598.504s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5599.264s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I will mute myself now and let member Ruseau read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5663.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5699.355s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes I appreciate being able to address this thoughtfully and not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5707.771s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: in a sudden resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5790.869s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5795.171s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh no, I was making sure nobody else had something to say as I was speaking slowly, but hearing none, motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5529.013s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so I have a lot of questions about the transportation logistics and I, this is probably not the time because we need more specific proposals but the concerns about busing students from every single elementary school to every other corner of the city around seems like a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5545.841s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: huge challenge but I think we can't have that conversation until there are more specific sites, so I just wanted to ask about the SNL Sports Academy and partnering with local colleges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5556.684s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do they have the ability to provide that consistent program for the duration of the public school school year because a lot of college schedules are very different than the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5570.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds a little bit like SNL Sports Academy does one-time events and provides programming in after-school programs that have a base core staff versus having, are the student athletes the ones who are responsible for the full-time staffing for the duration of the public school year starting in August, ending in June, and having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5597.666s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There are a lot of challenges that college students have throughout the year that take them away from a regular weekly commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5606.992s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone who's worked with college student workers knows that consistent staffing is a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8636.851s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, then Member Intoppa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8640.453s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to say so they covered some of my, my question about the expanded program but I just want to say as you're thinking about the new schedule and the new pathways to definitely I just want to say publicly to make sure to talk with our arts department because I know they have a lot of ideas and are facing kind of that opposite challenge of under enrollment because of scheduling and the opportunity so I would love to see that proposal come to us as a coherent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8666.699s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You said lots of out-of-the-box thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8668.14s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know they're already working on ideas there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8672.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Exactly, and so I'm excited to see what's coming there because I think it is multiple sides of probably dice, not coins, to torture a metaphor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9192.254s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, I just wanted to ask if this was a proposed change to the policy itself or if this was a for this year only given that we are like, we're looking at a proposed budget supplement and some restructuring based on the override results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9247.051s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I also just wanted to note that we have scheduled a budget hearing for February 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9252.853s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so that's putting it right up at this deadline here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9274.441s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But we had voted to approve that schedule with the public hearing and then another optional public hearing if needed after the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9285.467s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe we could send you those dates, Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9740.475s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9740.935s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this was just to bring this request to the forefront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9744.436s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm actually gonna make a motion to consolidate this with the following resolution because I would be happy to see this report, the summary of what our position responsibilities are looking like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9756.38s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: to inform the next budget cycle to be part of the justification for the budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10035.612s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and I will just add this bit at the end of my resolution about limited to roles and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10041.075s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's just to say what I'm not looking for is a conversation about people's performances and how individual people are and are not meeting these responsibilities is what is the need, what are the responsibilities, and do we need to make that a permanent, do we need a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10058.87s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: temporary coverage for this role, or should this be built into the new budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10063.711s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So just to clarify, it shouldn't need to be said confidential matters, stay confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10068.312s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to be really clear, this is about the need and the responsibilities that people have in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10073.994s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm excited to have that conversation about how we can meet students needs through some of the supplemental funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10092.967s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to make the administration prepare a report for our December 16th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10379.123s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinhold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10381.064s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm fully in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10382.826s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does this also place him on the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10389.21s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10389.93s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, yeah, because I think that's really important here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10392.712s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, he has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10393.833s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, has already said that he's been supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10396.035s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But is do we need to formally do that as we don't need to do that here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10403.581s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=345.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2225.21s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The accountability, oh, I guess I have to be called on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2228.558s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You're the member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2229.499s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm Phil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2230.44s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, the accountability percentile is that within the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2234.904s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2235.345s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I looked on the Desi site and it's it's compared to other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2239.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that within the district or other schools with similar similar population statewide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3272.973s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3274.454s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3276.355s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So you've mentioned a couple of these key areas within ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3280.838s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do these results, these gaps, do they match what teachers are kind of reporting outside of the standardized test evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3291.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because writing is definitely one of those things that you see a lot better in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3300.14s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: everyday classroom experiences rather than the standardized test model?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3394.982s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think with the writing, it's just more of the output, the final product that was... Because I know students approach homework very differently than they approach, or in class exercises very differently than they approach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3434.361s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: understand how good an indicator this particular test is on these really important skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3441.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3441.907s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4128.444s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4129.826s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, you're shocked, it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4132.429s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Should we be expecting to see some similar wiggles with the new integrated math that's coming up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4138.216s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You answered my question about, is this because we switched curricula at the elementary level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4142.702s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Should we be expecting this middle and high school as well in a couple of years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4196.194s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we don't think things are gonna dip back, dip down the way they did in some of these areas here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4201.176s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or is that just, we can't predict that yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4242.841s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So- The MAP scores and the MCAS scores are matching up in terms of which areas are strong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4304.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4304.646s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then as we look, as we think about staffing for future budget cycles, I know when we targeted certain literacy skills, we prioritized literacy specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4315.934s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know there was a period in MPS history when there were some math specialists in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4321.057s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that something that we're looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4323.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What you described sounds like the structures around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4327.955s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: team planning and scheduling with the trainings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4332.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're covering it with the existing staff and the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4336.449s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But is this something we should be thinking about as we look ahead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4400.185s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But we are not desperately suffering without them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4403.587s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And these scores seem to support that we are making the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4408.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4411.591s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All the things we could do with bigger budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4415.153s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5444.897s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5445.918s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5447.098s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5448.319s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I remember you saying a few meetings ago that the reason people didn't pass was because they didn't show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5454.243s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was mostly an attendance issue rather than an instruction issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5458.286s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And on the Saturday and after school, those four, and I forget if it was four or three and the other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5465.931s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5467.688s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If additional remediation services are needed, is that interfering with people's ability to take elective classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5476.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You alluded to the high school schedule and the constraints within the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5483.572s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How does this affect people's ability to take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5488.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I've seen that in other districts where the students who need MCAS support get pulled out of some of the other classes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5498.277s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: are really essential to wanting to be in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5535.149s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5536.129s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, because I know we have this challenge in elementary school of, like, my kid misses art in order to do strings, but sometimes she misses recess and science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5548.075s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I didn't ask Dr. Seary, like we need more targeted science, but do we also need more time for science as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5555.237s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So trying to understand what's fighting with what to guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5648.599s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for laying that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6643.594s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6645.649s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I'm looking at this list and I'm incredibly grateful that we are getting that kind of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6651.232s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a little concerned if we need all the support, putting that on someone in the city who already has quite a full time job, I could see this all being a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6662.797s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think coordination is great, but it feels like maybe we need some more of the support built into the school structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6675.682s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll yield the floor to Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7563.742s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7565.222s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7567.744s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so the amendment is to allow the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7571.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Every single bullet point here is work that is already happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7576.69s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7590.768s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is work that's happening uncompensated or as part of the, this is part of the current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7717.729s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's an annual stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7890.389s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's part of what I'd love to hear a subcommittee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7894.369s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7894.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I can I can do the math and say, all right, if it were if we're looking at 7500 for a year, and we're talking about a temporary acknowledgement and compensation for this work, we divide by 12 multiply by two months for November and December, that puts us at 1250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7912.779s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Which I think was member in tapas to accept this through the end of the year, at which point the subcommittee will have assessed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7924.372s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: and spoken with HR city schools to really figure out what is, what is the best use of, for instance, as time, what is the best use, what is the capacity within Medford public schools, because I really do think a lot of this capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7945.707s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It has to be in the schools that diversity, equity, inclusion permeates everything we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7952.432s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And it's gotta be built in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7954.914s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's gotta be part of the fabric of who we are and what we do and multiple people thinking of it, not just one person from the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7966.583s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's not the authentic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7969.656s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that Frances does fantastic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7971.718s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I wanna be really clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7973.299s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7974.64s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had no idea she was providing this support to the schools and I'm incredibly grateful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7982.047s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't want our students to suffer for these supports not being in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7988.252s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I also think having one person do this work is not sustainable long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7994.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7996.977s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: some acknowledgement of the temporary work, but not fully jumping on this model as written in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8023.51s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I do not want her to burn out doing all this work for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8029.034s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We need her too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8135.225s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: For the fiscal year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8136.185s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Fiscal year 2025, July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8140.629s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the first half of fiscal year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8218.256s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And member Olapade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8220.257s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You've done the motion to send it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8221.998s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8226.141s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8227.382s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll put it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8245.714s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=157.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure, it is really hard to just to know we have another member online now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=513.706s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Before we go, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=528.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=544.505s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=642.145s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having member Ruseau and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=647.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=713.712s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=717.034s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There's one piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=722.839s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Should that be sexual discrimination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=727.222s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=729.457s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=753.265s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not inclined to go in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=775.26s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1056.98s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a definition of the word consider?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1059.201s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because it's not offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1062.163s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not, like, I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1086.328s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1087.308s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Versus offering those supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1089.909s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like, I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1109.554s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1119.969s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1123.932s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1128.835s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There was an imminent danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1131.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1139.322s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1146.583s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's the non-punitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1410.039s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1546.694s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1574.65s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1645.558s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Remember, Randall wants to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1650.201s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1651.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the section where I had a lot of questions, and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1657.125s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If there are more than two parties, if we're talking about a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1661.854s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: like a team of people or multiple staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1667.558s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people as a group talking amongst themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1679.667s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1688.928s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these words, multiple things happening simultaneously versus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1699.039s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: An investigation into a group situation, and that's not really addressed, and I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1707.488s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: if there's guidance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1709.91s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.269s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.809s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I have examples that aren't Title IX specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1749.31s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1750.77s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1751.711s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1752.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1763.271s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1776.078s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1779.721s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One student is suspended, another one isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1783.291s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: parents are comparing notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1786.032s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And they're saying, this is what the administration told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1788.632s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, well, this is what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1790.313s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I can't release information about this other student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1794.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But the parent has given me this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1796.554s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I want to bring that as part of my complaint, because my kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1801.075s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Our kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1802.776s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1833.629s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do that or want to know, like, what else is there's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like, there's a there's a video of something that happens and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1842.035s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 1 complaint complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1928.382s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, if there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students or the school say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1962.088s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: and we as a group want to file a complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1966.071s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2124.653s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind, and I'm trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2129.475s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2138.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, we were on page nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2157.985s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2164.795s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if there is a interconnected investigation that remains within the single grievance or, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2511.138s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And this might've been the previous section, but so there's this timeline talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2524.02s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2537.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2539.522s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2541.148s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2589.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does that supportive measure potentially include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2595.325s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2629.909s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because one of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2644.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2683.257s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: but like administrative leave can't happen during it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2686.859s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And when does administrative leave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2715.049s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Privacy challenges on both sides are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.23s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.51s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2872.932s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2878.936s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that's certainly where we've seen in higher education these things come out, is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed, and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2893.151s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just, people need to be good people, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2965.352s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2972.378s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeals officer is involved in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2980.132s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There needs to be an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3013.066s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3034.557s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was only because that particular role had one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3112.313s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That is how I take them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3113.914s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3118.737s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3122.86s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Me too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3126.663s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: At my child's school, just not picking on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3416.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3533.337s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Interpreter, but until it's been proven, they can't put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3544.406s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So they do say that alleged victim is a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3551.933s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That person, but that's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3616.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So does this automatically go to a regular meeting or do we waive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3573.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to comment kind of a combination of these last two questions about transparency in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3578.479s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So member Graham already mentioned that the budget process is by law an open budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3584.041s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to say we in Bethlehem Public Schools are in a really good position to be transparent about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3589.983s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Our budget process got incredibly cleaned up by our last finance director who continues to consult one of the smoothest, most well accounted for budgeting that we've seen in quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3601.866s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was not school committee, but I watched the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3604.487s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It is a clean budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3605.767s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We know where the money's going, how it's being spent, and we're going to continue to have those public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3610.148s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have a new capital planning process policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3613.328s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have open subcommittee meetings where these things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3616.469s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They're happening in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3617.509s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: These conversations, we are collecting input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3619.989s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we are in a really good position to show what is happening in the schools, where the money is going, and how it is responding to the needs that we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3631.613s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: from our department heads, from administration, from our vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3636.899s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is a good time to be transparent and we're ready to do that with these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4723.358s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I did look at these numbers when I was doing some of the analysis and our levels are back to where they were right before the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4732.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So when people left the school to have their needs met elsewhere, they're coming back to Medford and they're coming back with significant need based on not just the pandemic, but just general student needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4748.724s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think things are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4919.626s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to say, we got here because we made decisions that filled short-term needs, that were band-aids, and we didn't look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4932.481s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Far ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5004.756s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're making decisions based on the money that's available and what we can and can't do, not necessarily what is best for students in the long term from the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2140.529s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so this presentation was very much about remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2143.852s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering, while we have these folks on the line, if there's anything we need to be keeping in mind for a new building that could potentially be coming to Medford in the next few years, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2224.608s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2225.709s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are there resources available to help with some of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2229.25s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not remediation if it hasn't happened yet, but you mentioned grants for getting filling stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2237.153s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that sort of thing available for new installations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4445.746s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4448.823s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about expanding the pool of drivers or what is the main impediment there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4456.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4458.271s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the timing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4459.332s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it just a fixed thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4460.693s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And the reason I'm asking is as we look to plan for the next few years, what are some things that we maybe could expect in order to get the pool of people we needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4474.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think member Graham's questions around how we can support the people who are already there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4479.15s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: are really key, but looking at expanding the pool, like once people are in as drivers, do they stay or are we losing people partway through the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4487.753s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What can we do to make sure we have more people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.106s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And would we be looking at that going up in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4527.587s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's going to go up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4651.843s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like if we shifted school days, that's not going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4657.13s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I live right in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1659.227s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My question is what of these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1663.68s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: can or should be bundled right does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1666.322s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1668.224s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does it help to do all the HVAC together because of a vendor or because of timing, or is everything here, like the roof rebuilds does it not matter which building it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2033.922s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, that reminds me of one of the resolutions we just had, I think last month or maybe it was the beginning of this month, around understanding what the needs to upgrade electrical systems to move away from fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2049.485s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that's not a specific project, but that's something we want to be planning for so that we're not kind of forced into making these decisions around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2062.308s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: just on the basis of cost and availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2067.309s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's an assessment that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2152.518s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Though presumably that's the kind of thing, I guess then that question comes to the same question we had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2159.284s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If we wait on that, does the price go up or down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2161.506s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because some capital projects, the price goes up if you don't do it right away, and sometimes it goes down significantly if you give it a year for the technology to catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2171.434s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So which direction does this lean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2176.378s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2284.744s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that, and so the cost of doing that is people's time, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2289.112s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or is it time and training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2292.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it hiring of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2352.731s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, then my other question in terms of making this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2357.796s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: These are all the things that we know are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2362.6s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: going to be big problems soon-ish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2367.522s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a kind of middle tier list of things that we know are coming in the medium term, but if we don't proactively maintain them, they're going to get worse and become even exponentially more expensive to fix?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2382.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2385.615s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The analogy here is things like our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2387.596s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's a lot harder to repair roads that are severely weather damaged and potholes and all of this than to do maintenance on things that are showing wear and tear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2400.084s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that saves us from doing desperate repairs later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2406.108s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know we didn't, I didn't ask you to prepare this in advance of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2409.811s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So maybe this is a better question for November, but I want to think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2416.963s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what we need to fix now to stop it from becoming a huge cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2643.626s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2644.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.067s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.888s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I wanted to put those things out there as they have to be factored in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2650.952s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we're probably at a point where we need to now start that prioritization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2821.024s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, ADA compliance to me feels like we really need to get in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2830.551s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But tell me more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2832.593s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2834.014s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we had identified some things at the high school, and I think we're waiting for member Branley to call the building and grounds meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2843.441s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does this go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2956.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I will recognize that I jumped on member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2959.217s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think he was also going to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2961.898s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We should see that we should finish this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3024.364s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just moved that up with the like recommissioning assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3027.765s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to say that category is recommissioning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3053.311s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, one other thing on that one, on electrification, is that, is there any sort of grant to support that assessment for climate mitigation, for energy, alternative energies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3073.98s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3077.145s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: but that seems like something that should be supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3160.415s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and on the drainage, is there any, I know that's something that you were really thinking about with the new McGlynn playground because, I mean, that playground was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3173.14s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: regularly not draining to understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3186.009s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not a drainage issue, but there is a drainage issue there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3192.374s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was just wondering if there's a service contract to be maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3198.072s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: this turf setting, does it also, is it possible to bundle that with the other school, even though they're, however- I believe the turf is being, I believe we are finally on the maintenance contract at the Brooks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3214.777s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3217.418s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: With the door sweeps, there was also a dumpster mitigation that I wrote down that I don't see in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3226.368s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the general, there were two pest control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3285.232s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's all one project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3286.592s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That should all be in line 27 or are they separate lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3592.113s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, part of my question on that is, what does that do to summer programs that we're offering in different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3600.481s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know most of our programming this summer was at Missittuck and high school, unless I'm missing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3610.811s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: In the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3612.232s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3761.242s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, as I recall, there's the determination based on what the project is, and then there's also a funding threshold, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3767.707s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm looking, if I'm remembering correctly, and I might not be, it was 250,000 was a cutoff, and I'm looking right there at network closet mini split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3784.019s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know what borderline is gonna dictate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3787.754s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: how things are classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3788.935s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if that's if we need to look at that quote a little more carefully for that determination, we might need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3798.302s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sure knows that number much better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3835.523s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is we have talked about getting elementary school students into middle school spaces, whether it's after school or some other reorganization down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3851.949s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know that that is concrete enough, but I know that when I spoke to Nick Tucci, for example, the concerns around having elementary school students in there would require some changes to classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3872.338s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what the timeframe is that maybe the superintendent knows that a little bit better or somebody who's been talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3878.061s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're due to get an update on after school at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3882.243s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But that is something that is potentially a capital project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3892.249s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If we're looking at changing who is in the middle school building, the what are currently the middle school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3918.303s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, quite capital, but right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3921.164s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3944.21s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I guess, Dr. Cushing, you mentioned the roof as being ready for solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3950.251s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are there other solar projects that are possibilities down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3957.361s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: you mentioned that for the Andrews, are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4059.608s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4060.889s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4061.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was talking to a third grader who apparently they like to be fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4066.372s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4067.032s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4068.253s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4072.446s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, fourth grade, whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4073.807s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Anyway, I was gonna say, I think this is when I was having audio trouble, but anything Curtis Tufts, I assume that those calculations are being made with MSBA thinking in mind of what's worth doing in a building if we really are looking to co-locate and that five to seven, sorry, five year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4098.926s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4227.081s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, we have that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4228.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4267.302s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So does that take the place of adjournment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4269.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9508.884s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9514.869s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What is elevated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9515.909s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is zero the baseline on everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10349.916s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have three questions, two of them for Director Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10353.86s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10357.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that end of calendar year or end of school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10365.401s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10366.081s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance Councilors has affected the delivery of health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10373.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10398.553s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10402.294s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10418.52s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10419.06s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10424.462s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: People can tune in and out to different sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10426.863s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not an enrollment based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10429.292s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.846s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what opportunities there are for teachers to give feedback or share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13069.892s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: how well it is working for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13071.413s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I realize there's still a lot of training going on, but that formative assessment of, is this curriculum working for us and for the people who are delivering it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13079.577s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can see a lot of these meetings coming, we're looking at the student data and we're really focused on the students, which is absolutely important, but I, where the teacher voice and their experience, is that happening in the PD sessions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13096.305s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that happening in the weekly meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13196.451s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And participation on the DLT is volunteer basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13200.635s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13201.455s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't turn anybody away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13205.358s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But there's no stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13487.255s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to amend this the same way I amended last week's to include nicotine pouches and non, we have the phrasing in last week's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13496.929s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: minutes to include nicotine pouches and state exclusion of prescription nicotine products, such as patches prescribed to end nicotine dependence and addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9683.445s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9689.886s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Either do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9697.117s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: protocol in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9707.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I trust our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9708.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9735.177s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not a fan of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9737.278s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted, things can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10150.718s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10153.759s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10156.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just during school hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10157.88s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to say that I...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10209.372s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10223.575s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10790.737s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10791.777s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10792.198s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10800.803s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: These are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10806.927s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10812.29s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to do that now or give an overview of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10818.455s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: of what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10826.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10834.806s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10845.173s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It expands the definition of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10847.202s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: reduces anxiety, and increases equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10850.645s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Question seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10855.029s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10867.821s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's valid question seven, along with the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10872.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10882.911s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10893.097s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10894.935s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10901.258s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10908.861s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Many people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10915.243s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10921.471s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: starting an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10928.253s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10931.794s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so we need to expand what we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10934.435s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10940.217s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10946.218s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But if we're gonna ask people to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10949.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: to spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10952.197s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We found out how low many of our stipends are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10956.379s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have been hearing for years about competition with other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10961.14s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so that is question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10965.042s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10969.803s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We are still committed as a body to working to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10974.798s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: our students and educators have what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10977.761s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11005.473s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So what's our definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11013.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11420.451s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we, sorry, I think, Simon, are you here for this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11425.613s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11426.514s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have our frequent flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11430.576s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11489.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have some, I have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11491.263s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11492.124s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what happened to the language about student use and signage from the original policy or what's online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.244s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.704s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11524.445s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11527.886s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11539.569s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11542.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11552.743s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Nicotine pouches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11555.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11559.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11572.431s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11573.571s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Not patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11581.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, I have our assistant super chair saying yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=128.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever June 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=153.433s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the approval of the teacher budget line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=157.434s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=161.116s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There were two abstentions, no no votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1676.263s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1677.404s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1693.899s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: because I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1903.465s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2874.85s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2877.891s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Were there people who wanted to do Summer Fun that didn't get to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3213.001s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3217.003s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What happens next for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3879.437s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3883.06s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me of the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3903.401s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So remember Ruseau touched on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3904.843s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What was the percentage of students who accepted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3908.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3961.961s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early DIBELS, early MAP, or even qualitative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4011.953s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.247s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.607s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4031.753s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4044.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hill and others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5672.463s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: May I ask what that looks like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5675.684s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5677.404s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5725.509s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6045.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6507.321s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6513.996s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6524.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, this one's too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6526.898s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And they all end up being too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6528.819s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have to do this look big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6531.219s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was the last one to fail, but what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6537.24s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6539.621s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6541.001s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6547.844s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do you need more language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6549.524s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I got enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6550.365s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6929.215s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6934.856s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If it is a parking fee for vehicles and a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7238.561s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reichelt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7239.321s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7245.783s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You said they accepted full responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7249.024s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just an I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7304.163s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7307.185s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7308.846s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7310.347s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.002s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reindell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9455.263s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9460.49s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9463.936s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9664.853s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I love the efficiency of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9666.273s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9677.808s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9678.068s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So just something to keep in mind proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9681.175s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10151.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: there any other motions associated with this policy motion to waive this is this the sort of thing where we can waive the second reading because this is very much aligned with the massachusetts association of school committee recommendations so motion to waive the second reading i don't think we should do that no all right withdraw the motion okay so this will be on the agenda again next week for a final reading got it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10247.004s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.084s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.525s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10260.809s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10261.369s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=503.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=505.323s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a quick question and then I'm happy to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=509.686s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what collaborative budgeting looks like to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=512.788s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like how do you work with other people on the leadership team and in the administration and schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=521.514s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like how does that play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=693.134s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=121.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to enter executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3881.687s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3882.928s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to repeat the questions from Member Ruseau and Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3888.072s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I do want to say I've worked with a number of programs in this sort of thing, and I have found that City Year is one of the more supportive, providing the support to employees than some of the other similar programs and even those as part of the AmeriCorps program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3904.203s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I found City Year to be really a solid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.345s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.745s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The question that I have maybe is for the administration more than you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3914.331s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Roberts, it's around what this looks like in terms of planning coming into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3920.555s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we've, anyone who has been in education or well really many, many jobs, it's not exclusive to education, has had a student teacher, an intern come in and that can often be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3930.683s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: more work for the person supervising, obviously for great benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3934.546s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I really, really support programs that are teaching these skills and giving these community collaborations an opportunity to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3943.854s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not about that, but what kind of foundation and conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3949.398s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: would we be having with the teachers and the administration in the schools, particularly noting that we are now in the summer period and many of the staff will be coming back right before school starts and moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3963.535s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's a question about onboarding and the commitment for what it looks like on the ground for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3969.321s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: really being able to get this going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3972.064s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I appreciate what Member Olapade said, that this is an and, not an or, but even adding ands to the top of already very full jobs is a lot of work, and I'd love to hear about how that is managed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4088.277s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry, the other part of that was making sure the teachers and support staff that are being worked with have the opportunity to express that this is our specific need in this specific year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4861.226s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I could, I apologize, this might have been said already, but is the third, we're talking about an elementary school and a single classroom, is the third grade a fixed point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4873.29s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think the schools that we're looking at, particularly the Mississippi is where we've had a lot of concerns about the average class size being a lot for a single teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4883.353s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's not necessarily in the third grade, for example, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4889.275s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What kind of, how does this intersect with our class size questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4895.439s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're having another adult in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4914.793s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not fixed for a particular grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5758.581s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley, you're muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5880.609s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I think these are all really valid concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5883.011s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I also think this is an opportunity to pilot what community partnership looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5887.835s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's something we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5889.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's a way forward in making Medford a great place to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5893.74s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I can hear concerns, maybe two programs is too much for a pilot, given the uncertainties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5900.166s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5902.645s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think this is something we can learn from, and it will lay a foundation for being able to have more partnership, more community support, training people to be in education and make a difference in students' lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5915.669s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's a valuable pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7420.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So versus tabling the motion versus tabling this until we see that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7521.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8432.816s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mr. McHugh and everybody who contributed conversations both within the administration and within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8441.603s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: These were not easy conversations, and I appreciate the clarity of the story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8446.026s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One thing that this story doesn't tell that I think it's important to say on the floor in this meeting is that this whole process has revealed a lot of important conversations that need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8459.096s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It has the potential cuts from the initial budget proposal have revealed the challenges in the high school schedule, the middle school schedule, the enrollment and distribution of students across the schools, particularly the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8474.603s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's raised questions about the stipend rates and then the timing of the budget cycle itself and how it coincides with non-renewals and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8484.748s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that is really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8486.989s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8488.37s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's not immediately germane to the approval of the budget at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8493.493s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But the one thing that I would like to do, I would like to make a motion that the school committee receive a report by December 7th describing the implementation and impact of the position reductions that were not related to enrollment, just to understand how the intended and unintended consequences of the decisions are going to affect next year's budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8513.807s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because what I hate seeing in budgeting is when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8517.249s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: a position goes away, and I will say I'm particularly concerned about some of the middle school positions, but when it goes away and then we never go back to say, how did that pan out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8529.718s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Things just disappear and fall off the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8532.42s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I would like to see a report to inform the next budget cycle of how those impacts affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8559.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8561.031s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I had phrased it, the report describing the implementation and impact of position reductions between the previous and current year budgets to understand the unintended and the intended, sorry, the intended and unintended consequences of these decisions will affect the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8580.035s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to send that to someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8658.347s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's all I have to say for now, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9500.388s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Quick clarification, are the kindergarten teacher numbers based on projected enrollment or current actual enrollment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9545.288s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I was curious and I will say, I'm more familiar with the Roberts just because that is where I have a student because the projected enrollment is the same as the current enrollment, but the number of teachers in the budget is less than the current number of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9561.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that is an increase in class size that we're expecting, we're not sure if we're gonna need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9620.039s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does the housing market play a role in that in terms of, you know, I know there are neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of younger families move in unrelated to birth rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9643.997s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9891.995s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's contractual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9895.777s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's in the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9897.238s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All the stipend rates are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10067.054s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10948.726s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10978.942s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11362.389s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: OK, in phase 2.2c, the capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, those just get incorporated into the plan itself and don't need any kind of special call out for funding requests, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11438.741s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so then following on that, it's presumably out of the scope of this policy to request from the city that they respond to the phase five here, the approved, go forward it to the city of Medford with the funding request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11453.991s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: we're going to assume, hello, we're going to assume that we get that information back, but that's outside the scope of the policy, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11480.711s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this is this communication is coming both ways and we're seeing in a timely manner I think the way that city council and school committee can work together on this and of course the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11493.464s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was curious how this interfaces with our consent agenda where we are approving purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11501.108s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If it's in the capital plan and in the budget, we still need to approve the actual spending of the money when appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11508.611s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11509.872s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my very last thing, I also did not find any typos, but I think that phase seven, number one, I think the two sentences should each be their own item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11523.461s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Phase 7, 1, net school spending, and then the attachment should be a separate motion to amend it in that way, if I have to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11561.351s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to motion to waive the second reading this feels, but I was, you know what, I was on this, I was on the committee in the room when this was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11568.216s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So let me turn it over to colleagues who are not on the strategic planning, capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2698.695s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5717.259s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5718.881s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5721.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was going to ask about targeted follow-up, because we know that response rates tend to be low among some of your invited populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5729.943s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My other question is, how are you going to be measuring the success of the institute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5734.806s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it comparing the people who did it and didn't, who were all issued invitations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5738.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How do we know that this program worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5837.55s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5919.105s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6085.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'll amend my motion to include those dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6128.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6191.823s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I don't have a lot to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6193.004s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was really a foundational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6194.406s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We had a great crowd of people who gave us an overview of what was happening and we're moving forward towards phase two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9344.116s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive this reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9363.169s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.21s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.691s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9771.252s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive the definitions reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10573.524s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have another minor text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10576.265s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10597.751s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10605.303s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I did have a question on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10609.106s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10613.949s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10623.539s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10627.222s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10631.486s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10641.836s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10648.737s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: who exactly, how are we getting these numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10651.279s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Why are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10656.262s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10666.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10826.19s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10961.706s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Then maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11127.947s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11128.307s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=23.683s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=24.665s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, how many years have we been Zooming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=27.43s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=30.56s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So please be advised that there will be a meeting of the Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability Subcommittee of the Medford School Committee on Tuesday, May 28th, five o'clock p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=61.624s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The Zoom ID number is 926-407-5749.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=68.528s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we will start with a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=71.07s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do I do the roll call as the chair or does Paul, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=75.973s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=78.215s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=79.376s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=81.604s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=83.066s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Three, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=84.328s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Zero, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=85.47s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we are joined by members of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=89.976s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I believe some members of the public as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=91.939s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=94.702s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the follow up on the resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=98.027s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't actually have the resolution number in front of me, but be it resolved that the Subcommittee for Curriculum Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability meet with the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in these reviews consistent with the policies described in Section<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=125.651s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: of the Medford School Committee Online Policy Manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=130.302s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So by way of context, we've called this meeting because in recent years, the Medford Public Schools have adopted a number of new curricular materials through a robust process of review and input and stakeholder input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=144.573s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we would like to have the ability to assess whether our goals for adopting those materials are being achieved and what that looks like in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=155.582s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the materials themselves, as well as the instruction and the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=159.325s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And by way of further context, in the Medford Public Schools strategic plan, item A1 is to establish an ongoing process of curriculum review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=170.511s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm happy to pull up that document with the details of that, but I've asked Dr. Galusi to give us an update on where we are, because phase one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=180.217s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: is slated for 2021 through 2024 and here we are in 2024 and we'd like to get ahead of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=188.243s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think if we start with an update on phase one and then discuss what phase two looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=194.887s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it useful to say who's in the room here from the schools before we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=256.823s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hi there, Jennifer Skane, Principal of Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=447.49s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think we should dive deep, but just to get a sense of what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1210.359s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, did you have any questions, particularly as someone who's seen a lot of these curricula come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.249s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.75s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1219.151s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1221.437s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, so I think what we want to do, so this gives us a really good foundation for what's been done, what's in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1228.499s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the goals in calling this subcommittee at this point in time is to say, so some of these things are due to be evaluated regularly, and that process is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1242.482s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things I want to be really thoughtful about is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1247.784s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: that there are a few different stages of assessing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1250.507s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know this is ridiculous for me to say with this many educators on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1257.273s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things that I've been thinking about in regards to this is that didactic triangle where the content is one piece of a triangle and the students and the teachers are the other points and assessing the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1271.227s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: isn't just about the content itself, but it's about the relationship that that content has to the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1277.935s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think the review process isn't necessarily a conversation about the teacher-student relationship, but it is to the content and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1286.424s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: into the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1288.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so some of that looks like, for the content and the teachers, that looks like the implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1293.631s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And is this doing, is this working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1297.474s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are these things being implemented with fidelity and in a way that the teachers are adequately trained to teach this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1304.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then that seems to me something that needs to come earlier than the process of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1310.666s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: assessing whether the students have mastery of the content or whether they're in well hopefully the engagement with the content is coming sooner and to be able to assess that through observations through test scores whatever it is and what that process looks like so it's not just we're looking at everything all together once we hit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1330.25s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the six years or the curriculum expires in 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1332.912s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we're just deciding if we're gonna renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1336.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to make sure that we have a process in place to review that in a strategic targeted way at selected points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1344.938s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And you all on the call know far better than I do what is feasible, because as we all know, the more time you spend talking to people about what they're doing, that's less time that they're actually doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1355.803s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So figuring out what that balance is, is something that I'd like to kind of lay out in terms of the timeline, who the stakeholders are, and the role that different people are going to be playing in a review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.375s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.535s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I would love to hear from the folks on the ground there as you know, is, is map testing giving you the information you need and what other information do you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1549.138s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What are, what are the ways to get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1550.798s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think as we all know, we, we don't all want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1554.88s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't want to just make test scores the measure of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1558.401s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What are the, what are the metrics we need here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1879.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I just don't want to lose sight of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1881.187s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So the scope of this meeting is about assessing the curricula, not necessarily student gains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1886.068s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, part of the goal of these curricula is to reflect student gains, but to make sure that we're measuring something that tells us whether the goals of adopting a given curriculum are being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1898.172s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I see hands in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1899.672s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1900.312s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Demos was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1906.912s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, did we lose her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2089.123s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And sorry, Mr. Tixera, the list that we just saw from Dr. Galussi of the curricula, how many of those have the built-in ELA support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2099.409s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know it was included versus a separate curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2202.636s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2255.151s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2256.511s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That actually, if anyone else has comments, I welcome them, but that seems like a reasonable transition to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2317.433s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2319.284s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to the other kind of takeaway I wanted to get from this, which is the timeline of when that, it sounds like MAP provides a lot of flexibility for doing a lot of that in real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2330.269s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And if that is embedded in the process, I don't know how much more explicit it needs to be, but I'm interested in kind of identifying who are the stakeholders in making those decisions and getting that input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2343.494s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know when curricula is chosen, it's done with community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2347.336s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: from families, obviously a lot of, most of the folks in families are not educators or curriculum developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2354.701s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, but they can speak to the experiential component of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2360.245s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And of course, the teachers who are teaching it saying this is working, this is not working anecdotally, qualitatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2367.611s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So identifying who those parties are and when they come into the review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2374.556s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think would be a useful exercise for this call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2575.973s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are there thoughts from the group on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2580.657s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And also giving some attention to non-MCAS subjects as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2586.602s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know we've been talking about NWEA MAP, but a lot of the math and the literacy is baked into things where there's a little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2599.684s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to say leeway in other programs, because it is they're absolutely rigorous and to standards, but how can we make sure that's being included in this process and that those programs are getting what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.479s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.919s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to another question I had for this group, which is the cross-departmental influence, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2737.925s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see Mr. Cieri is on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2740.506s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do our students taking advanced science classes have the advanced math skills that they need to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2747.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And what room in reviewing curricula saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2750.732s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The next grade is getting students are coming in with the knowledge that they need to succeed at this grade and with this curriculum or looking at across you know do a piece does the statistics department have the statistics students have these math skills or these critical thinking skills that come from a humanities program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2769.015s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering what cross-curricular opportunities there are to say this is a program that speaks to multiple needs, and certainly at the elementary school level, foundational math, foundational reading, but being able to make those connections across areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2796.513s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do either of you wanna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2798.214s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And particularly in terms of being able to review curricula with that in mind, not just are the students getting these things, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2996.554s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that taps into a question that we had brought up earlier of, is it the material?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3001.396s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the implementation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3002.597s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the instruction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3003.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And really being able to assess it out, because we don't want to throw out a curriculum that has a lot of potential and would be doing well if there were more training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3015.323s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But we also don't want to keep hammering away at a curriculum that isn't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3021.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I saw two hands go up, although one of them, I think, just went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3178.263s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's another great point that I think is not quite this meeting, but when a teacher brings a curriculum to the district and how that gets adopted and assessing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3191.83s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's a great point as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3195.132s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Nicole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3307.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3308.317s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that was kind of the goal of this of getting this group together to have this conversation is to say, what does that process look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3317.342s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And what is the timeline for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3321.104s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know if that becomes a question with with the strategic plan for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3326.267s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: As we said, the phase one is coming to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3330.737s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Coming to an end this year and knowing what that phase two is, is something that I can speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3339.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I hope the rest of the subcommittee agrees we'd like to know what, as we approach the end of phase one, what does phase two look like, who's involved, and what's the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3527.803s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3528.724s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm noting that it's six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3529.845s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would love to see this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3533.287s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3534.067s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I do notice it is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3536.229s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think, especially in those instances where we're looking at, I don't want to call them Frankenstein curricula, but to say there's a gap in this published material that we need to supplement with either something homegrown or some other published material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3713.991s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, although I will say I love the reasons for initiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3716.832s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's really important to make explicit that some of it is scheduled, some of it is emerging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3725.036s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And some of it is external.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3729.258s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3732.079s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And do you have a target timeline for this process from adoption to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3743.024s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: For these stages, you said we could spend a few years in implementation and monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3748.325s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3818.155s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's five, my daughter was in second grade and my other one's in third now, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3847.861s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't think it's fully up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3850.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3857.915s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.335s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think it's useful for this, if not the subcommittee or even the entire school committee to know when is it reasonable to say, all right, into readings been in place now, we need this up, we need an update on whether it's achieved its goals or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3873.287s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know school committee approves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3875.128s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't teach, we don't tell teachers how to teach, but we do approve major investments in curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3881.512s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so knowing when it's reasonable to see those updates, that data, those data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3892.016s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3893.917s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so mapping out where those are for the various curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3926.803s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3928.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3929.824s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone else have anything to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3931.325s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know this was kind of a preliminary meeting, and it was for many of you laying out some of the things that you've been already working on for a couple of new school committee members, but it is very much appreciated, especially after hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3944.83s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um member Brandly or member member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3947.031s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Did you have any other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3962.082s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3963.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3964.363s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3969.386s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3970.167s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm excited to see this, this next stage of the process laid out and to understand where we are with the various curricula so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3979.502s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We can come to you when it is appropriate and not make extra work asking questions and when they're not, when the answer is forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3999.286s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4001.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Brandly, Member Ruseau, is there- Can we go to a door?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4009.371s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4010.232s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4011.733s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4013.274s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4014.375s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4015.215s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4017.757s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4019.158s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4021.08s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.04s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.641s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much, and I look forward to continued conversation on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=779.15s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=782.03s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, my question is how this intersects with the building and grounds subcommittee, but I think your question was more directly related to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=943.683s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=944.364s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So the other thing I was going to say, when you said it's time for the school to take this back and make the decision, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=949.587s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I think we need to build into whatever our procedure is, a regular like report out according to the city or according because we need to be in their plan in their capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=961.716s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1011.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Their presentation is not intended to be at that level of detail, which is why I like what they're doing, you know, they're turning all municipal roofs to solar right like we want in on that we've got a part of that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.095s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.815s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1457.921s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Round opens July 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1484.643s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Applicants must demonstrate an emergent public need and evidence of seeking alternative funding to the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1511.818s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: way ahead of the game and like here's the list of things and we're just sitting around waiting for you know the the free cash certification city's budget picture to come become clear yeah okay um in response to your comment about the principles and i think we need some threshold guidelines on what constitutes okay little project i like that yeah i<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1883.632s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All-day refrigeration, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1887.975s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: ADR systems automatically adjust HVAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1954.431s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1954.951s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does anyone have nut allergy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2255.717s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To what extent does Waterheed's failure at the Brooks predict Robert's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2262.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They already failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2263.811s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2300.73s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I live in an old high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2307.394s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe the condo conversion in 84.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2330.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to be able to put that on our board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2331.543s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That was eligibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2332.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So you should be submitting a letter before you do a poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2336.445s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2363.043s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2363.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And what year was that in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2365.664s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's like early when we started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2369.106s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2369.286s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2559.482s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We made a to-do list for Peter of things that he was going to look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2562.952s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2585.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's not why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2638.772s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do you need any, do we need to include any information about the relationship with building and grounds and or the road?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3046.488s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it worth making a presentation on this to the MSBA building committee or not yet or, or, I mean, I know, I know, I know that she did the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3056.993s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3070.821s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I believe I signed up for Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3073.722s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3074.582s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm waiting for the official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3076.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: calendar you're good yeah at least you just said she was gonna send one so yeah okay but it's in my calendar i'm skipping another meeting for it sounds great sounds like better than whatever meeting that was yeah um okay is there a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn so seconded by right bill all those in favor aye<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=447.864s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever the public hearing minutes and the behavioral and special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=463.259s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the minutes to the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to include a link to the meeting recording, because I believe that the feedback provided by the representatives from Curtis-Tufts should be easily accessible with the record of the votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=493.413s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'd also like to strike from the public hearing minutes the home address of the students who provided public comment for privacy reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=506.976s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And just put the- Just put their names that they spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=512.557s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think their home address should be on public record for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=833.992s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, we would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=844.1s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4200.421s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Rheintald?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4201.381s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I have a question about the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4203.902s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I was also incredibly encouraged by the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4207.303s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of those people who are often targeted by some of these challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4225.77s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4230.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what that sub data looks like there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.351s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.991s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4266.68s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4327.369s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4328.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I agree completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4329.69s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4336.052s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this all this work really has to be district wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4339.193s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm so encouraged by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.154s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.834s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And thanks to everyone who made it possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5330.169s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5335.134s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5383.507s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are we going to need a break in the middle do we need to take our, like, two minute break now or if you want a motion to recess for five minutes, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9030.472s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9031.493s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you member on top of for summarizing some of those emails because we all got them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9036.456s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, these numbers didn't change since the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9041.299s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I will also repeat myself from the last meeting, which is to say there are no good solutions here there's only least bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9048.903s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But what I want to know is what are the other options here, we you know we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9053.866s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This looks terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9055.467s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Having no money and shutting down the schools is also terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9058.71s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What other things were considered what can we, what can we expect here what if this is the best what, what did we not do to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9070.22s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then, particularly in terms of the extenuating circumstances numbers I think we've done a great job of presenting the big picture and how much money is here, but we got a lot of information about what those on the ground numbers are how many appointments are happening how many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9085.698s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: IEP is how many particular needs are happening at the Mississauga across health services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9090.48s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't see any of that here to understand what makes this the least bad solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9097.062s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we're going to have to figure out with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9099.843s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it is the role of the district to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9105.425s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Jerry, thank you for absorbing these comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9107.486s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You did the numbers, but that's not where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9112.298s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You took the data that was given, but I feel like I just don't have any of that information about other than hearsay what people have sent me and knowing that this was sat down and said this was the possible course of action, and it wasn't feasible because of this, but this is feasible and I want to know that it really is I need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9131.969s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: that there's a plan, you can say this, this person is going away again I'm going to repeat myself because this is the same presentation, the work isn't going away and so who's going to be doing it right if you're cutting the person who's leading the effort to roll out our new health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9147.288s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Where is that happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9148.568s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What will this look like in practice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9151.109s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because these are the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9152.63s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know that we have time to get into those nitty gritties, but I would really like to see some information, not just on numbers, but the on the ground numbers, the qualitative reasons that this is the least bad plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18616.156s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18620.157s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=232.632s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, is there any history that we need to know about about how this has been done in the past other than inconsistently or in terms of timeline where the administration this year we got a packet full of policies slash draft policies with the final draft forthcoming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=435.84s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=860.62s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Let's say it's about arrival and dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=899.665s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So... Because if they have a concern about a school committee policy, that would be raised outside of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1263.8s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So would I be so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1268.166s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know how you wanna discuss this, but since we were just talking about this phase three, step three, sounds like we're talking about approval of handbooks as a whole once all of the discrepancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1281.155s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if there's an item that needs discussion in subcommittee, that handbook is not approved rather than everything approved except for this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1291.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's a cleaner way to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1306.65s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think it's just an added sentence around each handbook will be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1314.012s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Actually, let me ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1314.872s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I assume we're approving handbooks one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1317.893s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we approve one handbook at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1323.815s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, but to say, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1328.186s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: approved by the school committee committee will be her handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1358.393s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, that was the question I asked on April 8th that sent us down a little spiral, and I just walked it back as it was late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1378.819s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We'll be in whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1402.822s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1408.725s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there ever a scenario when we send a handbook back to a school saying, fix this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1415.142s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or is that a, you are invited to this subcommittee meeting to discuss this handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1480.116s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, it seems to me the main thing, the role that school committee has here, or possibly the superintendent, I guess this is my question at the end of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1494.123s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: at the end of phase two here, this point three, the second part, or the first part of it, the school council will send the handbook and memorandum to the superintendent for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1503.667s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to specify what that review entails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1507.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I guess it's just sign off, but maybe it's the question about in one and two, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1512.671s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The only time the handbook becomes a problem, and I've certainly received questions from parents about this, is if they perceive that an enforcement of a policy, which is kind of what the handbook lays out, is in conflict with the policy itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1526.899s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Who's doing that reconciliation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1529.26s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Presumably it's happening in one... Or is that just what needs to happen in that first review and then the memorandum of changes says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1543.413s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: we need to make sure that this section, I guess I think there are relevant sections of the handbook that relate to new policy, law, regulation, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1555.76s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's what the memorandum is meant to do is to say, we changed the, I had this, we changed the discipline to match the new bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1570.031s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: policy, or when the out-of-school suspension, when the suspensions policy changed, to say we changed the discipline section of our handbook to comply with this, who checks it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1746.71s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But are we asking them to do that before they send it to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1750.731s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not asking them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1867.001s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The memorandums, I think, is perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1869.623s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You need to know what's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1871.865s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's your track changes of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1894.389s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, so I think one thing that we do need the superintendent's office to do unless this is us, but is to confirm consistency across elementary schools right if one elementary school makes a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1909.018s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1912.094s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: that affects the other ones or the two middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1916.377s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like I might've missed it, but one of them seems to have a homework policy and the other doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1922.08s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that seems like a problem in equity for students that making expectations clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1928.304s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I might just have missed it in this as I flipped through this large binder that we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1947.556s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I do think, if you get a memorandum that says you need to change this to comply with that policy and one school changes it in one way and another changes it in a different way, or is this first memorandum saying, no, no, this needs to change in this specific way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1967.708s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think- We're to say that all handbooks have the, you know, I think there's an important, there's a useful conversation to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1974.331s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't have to have it this year about should each elementary school have, should there be a Medford Elementary Schools expectations and then school-specific procedures?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1985.317s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Should there be one elementary school handbook with an addendum for the Roberts, for the Missittuck, for the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1993.862s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I do think there's some consistency that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1998.567s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2033.228s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2033.808s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, those are the three things I think we hear about consistency on levels, consistency across schools, consistency between school protocol and official policy, and then consistency between what parents are told verbally in the moment and what's written down in one or another location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2056.411s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this process can't address all of that, but it can address the consistency across schools with alignment with official policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2141.137s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to double check that there were tables of contents and everything, which there aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2147.922s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we mandate any parts of handbooks that every handbook must have this section or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2155.527s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I don't know if that's part of this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2206.488s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I do know people are looking and saying, look, this says right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2214.331s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely at the end, but I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2218.905s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's interesting, because some of these have federal laws included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2221.748s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of these say, we've included the policies we think are most relevant to elementary school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2229.316s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think nobody says, here, go to this website, which who would want to, knowing that website where our policies live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2307.18s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and the one that they gave us has a bunch of yellow highlighting that says, this is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2310.883s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2361.725s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I will say when it comes time for me to review, I like having it in hard copy, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2387.951s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, but is that, and then I guess in phase three here, we haven't said, so it says the school committee will receive copies and we will approve it, amend it or discuss further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2404.537s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does that mean everyone is reading every handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2425.58s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So is maybe is so is that I guess is that a separate question in terms of onboarding new members is you should have the handbook so you know what's happening in the schools on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2625.737s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I didn't mean to take us quite so far off topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2629.519s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So in terms of this policy, I think the staging is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2634.201s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The dates seem reasonable to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2636.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sure the people carrying out phases one and two have opinions on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2721.215s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think, I mean, I only know about the Roberts because Mia said, Oh, yes, I'm on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2729.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2729.908s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, former member of stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2779.489s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to say in phase 1.1 the superintendent or their designee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2791.67s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was there a designee within central administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2795.454s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think it needs to be clear that they're not designating it to... Yeah, so it always is or designee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2812.441s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so that is implied kind of across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2815.303s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know we've had things saying, well, we didn't mean that you should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2818.585s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We meant that your office should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2820.646s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2911.132s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2911.972s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can you just put this up on the screen so I can read everything, I think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2919.176s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2919.976s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was, yep, that's great for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2922.777s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, I don't need the, that magnification that you had before was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2928.16s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2929.788s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 125.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2929.828s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just needed it scrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2932.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I can see the end of three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2936.111s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't need to see the policy information section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2960.823s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3029.724s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm right in thinking that, because the handbooks have to be final and approved for students to receive at the end of August when school starts, because I know they sign off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3047.373s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: May has been terrible and with our very wise decision to push, bring the budgeting process forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3057.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: it just may, it compounds may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3060.787s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I'm not saying push budgeting back because knowing all this early is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3065.429s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a disconnect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3068.071s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is my pedantry on display here, that the digital versions being created in phase 1.1<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3077.802s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: is what becomes the draft digital handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3101.704s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, what you're asking is for the superintendent to duplicate the current year's handbook and update that to create the upcoming year draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3119.79s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The upcoming school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3175.886s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, if the superintendent notices an inconsistency and makes an update, do then they need to have, is there a third memorandum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3187.034s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want this many memorandums, but do we need to know that the superintendent updated the Brooks handbook to match the Roberts handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3207.563s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or do they do the superintendent have to go back to the school council and say hi for consistency reasons I'm making this change I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3257.76s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Provide the memorandum to whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3260.02s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To school committee and the school council, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3265.602s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3285.39s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3286.131s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Just remove the provide before create on the second line of number four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3297.181s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Backseat typing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3306.509s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3313.098s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would call these mandatory changes, but that'll just confuse things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3318.403s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we then, we're in subcommittee, do we motion to send this to full committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3323.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Passing it by the administration first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3397.679s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What comes after the word?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3398.999s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can figure out words in context, but I don't have enough of it for this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3437.742s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Getting administrative, getting the approval from the administration and or principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3537.696s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3554.389s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of this conversation for this meeting or is that the follow-on motion once this is reported out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3568.851s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3576.478s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, but I mean, do we need, do we just need to approve these as is once we get the?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3634.765s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because the current policy is we don't have a policy, just they have to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3640.028s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3640.469s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Until this policy goes into effect, we are not breaking our own policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3658.237s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it too late to amend this policy to say this policy will be effective as of August 1st, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3684.496s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, I thought our rule said it's effective immediately unless indicated otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3689.138s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I swear I read that somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3694.94s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I've got the page open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3697.121s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3697.581s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know I'm dragging this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3698.961s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And no, that's not it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3706.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Governance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3709.365s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I wish this tab could move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3754.072s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm taking your word on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3829.741s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think my only question is, when we bring this to the floor, do we need to talk about this year's handbooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3847.774s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or I guess maybe I'm asking if it needs to get added to the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3887.096s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Alright, so, but that's not a motion of this subcommittee that we review handbooks for approval by the end of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3902.23s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3903.171s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, then I guess we didn't have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3922.148s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3922.489s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3926.394s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: member motion second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3932.023s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3069.185s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3069.965s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just have a couple of questions regarding the proposed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3073.127s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So on slide 15, there's two positions being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3078.85s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It says payroll slash HR new positions, capacity and supervision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3082.932s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So with the current proposed budget cuts, could you just elaborate on what these two positions being added with considering they cost roughly $150,000 annually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3300.752s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I just had another question on slide 19 for the proposed general ed class size from schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3308.724s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, for 2025 for the Brooks it'd be up to 19.9.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3313.505s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The McGlynn 22.2, Mr. Tuck 22, and then the Roberts 20.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3316.927s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do you have any data about the possible negatives of increasing classroom sizes to that size as that could potentially put a lot of strain on teachers and educators in classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3483.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I'll start with what I like, which is I like the transparency and the clarity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3488.147s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you again for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3490.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I really like that this reflects the past year of spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3492.988s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's incredibly helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3497.149s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that moves into my first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3498.889s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just gonna go in numerical order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3501.85s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Slide seven, this didn't appear on the slide, but you mentioned that there was 500K for undistributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3507.951s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was that used for its intended purpose last year or did that end up being flexed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3569.134s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3570.255s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Slide 14, you mentioned new technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3573.137s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is this coming with added security concerns or costs to maintain safety, privacy, all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3618.47s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But that's one of the positions that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3620.905s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: potentially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3651.628s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, but there's a director position as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3666.246s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I'm always gonna have this question on slide 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3669.747s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see a lot of contract services listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3672.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What assurances can you give me that contracting these things out is more cost efficient than doing it in-house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3686.694s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3693.357s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3724.4s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, on this same slide, you mentioned the supply budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3727.282s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that going to reduce the, I'll call it an unspoken burden on individual staff members for supplies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3740.173s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: In terms of, are those for individual classrooms, or are they for school-wide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3776.209s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm glad that we are providing more of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3782.085s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham already asked about class sizes and offerings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3787.306s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would love some more information on the McGlynn position, the consolidation of the administrative position there, given that those are two schools and each of the other schools has its own administrative assistant and also given the particular vulnerabilities in that school's population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3865.805s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sure we'll hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3867.486s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3868.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3870.067s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my, my very last question was actually building a little bit on member Graham's question about the DPH minimums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3876.609s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We, my questions were, when are they, where are we and how do our health needs and this, the health needs question might be for some of the people out here compared to other districts with their ratios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4041.101s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, I understand that, and I will have questions for the administration at later dates about what the plan, if these changes are accepted, what the plan is, because just because you take people away, the work doesn't go away either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5868.483s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask a follow-up question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5871.024s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not sure, I may have missed it in Member Bransley's questions, but if the secretary positions are being cut at the McGlynn and other schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5884.751s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask a question if, because I'm not sure, it may have been clarified already, if APs were on the, being considered for being cut, because if the workload is being put onto the secretaries, I may be mistaken, but for the McGlynn, it's roughly, for the elementary school alone, it's 500 students per one secretary, and at the high school, based on the cuts proposed, it's gonna be 600 students per secretary, so if AP,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5912.256s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: AP assistant principals are cut in the future, then who's going to do the workload?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5917.485s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because the workload from the secretary is going to go down to the AP unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5920.57s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If that works, someone's got to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9000.985s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: hear from I just so I'm encouraged by the long-term prospects I want us to not be in this situation next year or any year after and then as we open this up to public comment I this you know this is what not just underfunded but deprioritized education looks like to be in this situation and so this year is terrible we are in a position where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9024.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're not going to find good solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9026.995s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We're going to find the least bad solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9029.435s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So please work with us to help us figure out what we can do to not cause irreparable damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13015.384s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: from speaking with teachers, they've told us that it is an open-door policy, and we've also been working with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13021.827s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Cabral to get in the new handbook provisions to explicitly state that Medford High School is an open-door policy to allow for school committee members to visit the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13240.362s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wonder if I could present a letter on behalf of the Student Advisory Committee drafted to the school board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13258.925s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: On behalf of the students of Mefford High School, we the students of the Student Advisory Committee, expressing a consensus opinion of the committee for the school year of 2023 to 2024, are writing this letter to express our opinion on the planned budget cuts to the Mefford Public Schools positions and budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13274.939s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The Mefford Student Advisory Committee acknowledges that the city of Mefford is presently experiencing a budget deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13279.684s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This deficit has put a great strain on city services provided to the citizens of Mefford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13283.755s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One place where these budget constraints are already felt is in the Medford Public School Districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13289.0s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of the major issues the Student Advisory Committee would like to highlight to the Medford School Committee include the lack of running water in the teacher's break room, a lack of heating and cooling in classrooms during the summer and winter respectively, as well as asbestos remaining inside of the facilities in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13305.953s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The school committee has proposed the budget cuts to the 2024-2025 school year budget of the Medford Public School Districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13312.015s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: These cuts, if carried out, will have an immediate and long-term detrimental effects on the quality of educations for the students in the Medford Public School District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13320.498s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: As a result of these budget cuts proposed in the fine arts positions, as well as numerous other positions, student activities that are essential to the school and culture of Medford High School, as well as the community of Medford as a whole, will be put at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13335.794s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Furthermore, this will lead to a drop in education quality and opportunities for students, which could lead to a decrease in the number of students attending Mefford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13344.396s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Furthermore, these proposed cuts will raise the workload of Mefford Public Schools faculties, further increasing the already large burden on Mefford Public School faculty members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13354.279s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Additionally, the proposed 2025 proposal would increase the average class size across the board from nearly 20 pupils per class, with McGlynn and Missitook pushing a proposed average of 22 students per class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13366.018s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The Student Advisory Committee believes that when it comes to student education, there should be no compromises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13371.022s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Students deserve the right to receive the highest quality of education possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13374.964s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: While the deficit does pose a considerable concern, the Student Advisory Committee would also like to point out that these proposed cuts are affecting teachers and lower echelon administrative staff who do most of the day-to-day paperwork and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13388.534s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: While the School Committee does not have the authority to make the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13391.957s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They can request that the City Council propose a new budget to account for the needs of students and teachers in the Medford Public School District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13397.819s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Students deserve a quality environment with well-paid teachers and faculty and a safe, operable facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13403.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And before I end off, I would just like to add a personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13407.29s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: As a lifelong student of Medford Public Schools, a student representative for the Student Advisory Committee, as well as a student government official, and someone who has performed in the fine arts, I can say without doubt that these cuts will result in an immediate and long-term, long-lasting negative impact for students for generations to come if these cuts are made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13425.59s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=790.178s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=792.64s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=793.921s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=799.507s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Don't say that out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=802.714s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So last week we heard comments about roof replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=806.156s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This isn't gonna mess with that, or this won't get uprooted immediately with- No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=818.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But this won't get in the way of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1333.872s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=132.234s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to go to executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5886.573s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I just I just wanted to say that I would like to see the default to be to consider the non fossil fuel solutions for our building projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5898.4s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: which I think is a reverse of kind of historically what we as a society has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5902.663s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm, and I think provision three here in particular is about bringing these decisions to the school committee so we can evaluate the language in terms of the climate goals that we have for the city the sustainability goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5917.491s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And, and not just the financial goals looking being able to look comprehensively at upfront costs and then sustained maintenance costs, and I think that's really important that we're not just making the decisions based on what it costs right now to do this, but also to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5934.483s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: maintain these systems and make them sustainable for the future, because we know a lot of our buildings are about to experience some major stresses with age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5944.831s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And this right here right now is the time to be planning for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9411.026s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9413.368s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So to confirm, we're looking at this coming out of the city budget rather than the school's budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9421.593s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Just wanted to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9424.116s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Then my question, Dr. Cushing, you alluded to this, what does compatibility look like for future projects in terms of what equipment we're going to need and being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9436.559s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: make the connection move transition into the next stage of renovating this what is more, and I guess maybe I'm asking what is Moore's law for HVAC equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9453.448s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because, in all honesty, provided the transition I was expecting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9456.67s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9490.494s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would love that, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9685.671s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, and then will the, do you anticipate, I know nobody can see the future exactly, but do you anticipate there will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9694.255s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: more climate friendly, more low carbon options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9698.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's kind of what I want to anticipate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9701.285s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to be in a cycle of replacing things with what we have, just because it's the only thing available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10262.697s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10267.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11802.305s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or member, I'm sorry, this is just to approve the pool<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11812.349s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have some questions about the athletics and theater, but that's still under discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11816.351s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we'll see that at another point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11820.813s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11821.413s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11823.274s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11824.254s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Pool and facilities rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12849.899s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak, Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12851.974s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to answer questions, but it's late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12854.295s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Basically, we've had a lot of new curricula come on in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12858.876s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have a pretty robust process for introducing the curricula and also our top goal or the number one on our strategic plan is to develop this cycle, so I'd like to get that process moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=104.714s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I believe member Graham is also in transit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=131.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3479.178s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about how things get recorded if someone abstains a vote, because we have it listed as 7-0, but it was 6-0 and one abstention on last week's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3561.15s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3567.253s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4353.248s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, but thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4476.269s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5891.981s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5893.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, thank you, Dr. Galussi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5895.919s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a couple of clarification questions, which is to note, so the table of substitute coverage, this school year, these numbers are over eight months, whereas the previous year is over 10 months, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5909.786s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5910.726s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5911.987s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But the number is still higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5913.728s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was school year 2022-23 particularly high in absence, or are we...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5922.283s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: or was this year particularly low?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5924.885s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Without more context on either side, I can't quite tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5983.805s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how we can project ahead as to what the need is going to be and what's typical here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5989.091s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are things actively going down because the needs are changing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5997.096s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6011.161s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great, so and then one little question, do long term subs attend planning periods and team school grade level planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6019.684s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of the long term sub responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6040.565s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and then I just wanted to confirm, I think you introduced some information that may have shifted my numbers, but it looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6050.279s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: we're spending 50 to 60% of the spending on substitutes is in-house, but in-house folks are covering about 86% of the need here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6060.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if we are shifting away from in-house coverage, we're going to see that percentage change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6066.525s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Although I do want to say, especially noting that there are a lot of teachers here, thank you for this coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6071.126s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It is much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6142.34s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I definitely want to second what Member Branley said about understanding where the, what coverage, where the services are being sacrificed in these situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6153.573s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6154.513s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I also wanted to ask, you mentioned a few of the things that the staffing company would do in terms of onboarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6161.474s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I always have this question when we bring in consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6163.795s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What is the added value of paying a staffing company to do this work versus things that we've thought of in-house, such as just raising the rates of pay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6171.816s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Why are we bringing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6173.677s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What else would the company add that would make that better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6249.848s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6254.29s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That makes sense, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6255.291s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just trying to understand where that money is gonna go to hire someone outside versus to the people doing the substituting, doing the coverages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6802.226s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6804.827s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just in regards to point number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6806.667s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6808.328s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see I see a, uh, lists this as although as awareness day, so I think that's a pretty easy motion to amend that policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6816.831s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The question of putting it on calendars is a little different because we have the public calendar that is the closures and then there was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6828.796s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: that we recognize Awareness Acceptance Advocacy Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6832.52s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering if that is part of, in terms of distribution to the public, is part of the longer conversation about the calendar and how it's published.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6842.608s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But absolutely, I think we should amend the policy as it currently exists, that line there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6848.861s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my question on number three, I wondered if it would make sense, although possibly not with the suggestion just approved, for the subcommittee to sit down with CPAC, the Medford Family Network's autism<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6865.459s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: spectrum parent support group and then the conversation around procedural safeguards and FERPA and all of those screening things and then prepare something that the full committee might be able to approve with a concrete step for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6883.111s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I wonder if that information gathering might be well suited for subcommittee with members of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7162.134s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7163.015s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You could potentially share the agenda on screen and not read it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8930.379s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so in the initial approval to set up this committee, we had identified various subcommittees, such as communication and community engagement, sustainability, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, finance, and then others as needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8944.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does this composition<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8947.051s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: have the ability to form those subcommittees along with the non-voting members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8951.552s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see you nodding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8952.352s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The other question is, looking at the broad range of expertise that we got, this committee was also designed to, I've been pushing very hard for advisory committees throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8964.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are there particular advisory committees that you anticipate needing based on applications who were unable to be seated as voting members or general expertise that we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9058.319s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9059.94s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm looking forward to receiving the initial report so we can confirm that those things are moving and are as inclusive as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9067.482s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9069.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I will now defer to Mr. Guillen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9514.425s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can I motion to approve the community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9518.367s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds like we feel comfortable moving forward with that vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9718.715s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or from like alternating for the non-voting member Rousseau, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9907.54s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I thought Member Ruseau had done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9910.382s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9921.269s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To be represented and voted on at the next meeting as to who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9930.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9997.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There's a question about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9999.867s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The ad hoc committee, when created, was about developing the process for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10003.927s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was told it wasn't about doing the actual review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10010.277s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I just got a zoom error message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10012.657s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I want to confirm that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10014.018s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is this ad hoc committee doing the review as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10016.358s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I am concerned about my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10019.719s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I will say that is my bias on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10038.607s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And just to report that we because this committee changed, we do not have the final process in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10046.293s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: For the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10200.46s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10201.481s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You said every school is required by whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10203.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a school committee rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10205.225s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a state rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10253.118s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's- I guess I'm looking at it from this side for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10259.062s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10260.784s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10358.378s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What are we approving that they'll be presented at the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10367.075s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And we're sending comments, feedback, further requests to you, Dr. Edward-Vince.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10377.702s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm unmuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10378.262s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10379.783s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=138.08s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And if he can't, my wife has been involved with this group, so I can speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=142.682s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I spoke with Ellery as well, but I'd love to hear where the district is coming from on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=147.724s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But it is a three question survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=149.805s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can pull it up, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=157.089s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had reached out to the Safe Routes to Schools people to say, hey, is there anything you'd want us to keep in mind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=163.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And they said, oh, actually, this thing that has been kind of chugging along slowly is set to launch tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=169.219s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it was, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=171.641s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=174.025s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The survey itself is run by Safe Routes to Schools, which is a statewide group that does local advocacy and assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=183.351s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And it is a very basic survey, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=187.313s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if you click on where you live, whoops, and then you answer questions about your child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=197.919s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How do you get to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=198.94s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How do you get from school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=200.901s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And this is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=203.174s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=204.635s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know this group is interested in getting more data about what stops people from active transportation, walking, biking, rolling this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=216.201s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But this survey is just this assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=218.483s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I believe it goes to the state organization of Safe Routes to Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=224.146s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: They do the data and provide a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=232.748s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have the report from the Roberts from 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=234.95s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It used to be done by school, and I think they're pretty excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=239.454s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, Kitty, about having a comprehensive approach from the district on this, but it's really focusing on alternative transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.114s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.314s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think I'm right, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=479.254s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes one meta question I have is whether we're looking to have an assessment and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=485.656s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The what are the obstacles to participating in district provided transportation or alternative methods versus what could the district do differently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=495.078s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That would shift your transportation behavior because those are kind of two different approaches to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1366.447s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1368.708s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I will note that Member Ruseau and several other members sat in on the Student Advisory Committee or Student Advisory Council meeting last week, and they raised some challenges with the busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1381.652s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of it was around how it is implemented at the schools in terms of stopping points and lines and crowding, and some of it was around timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1390.336s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1394.127s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The high school high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1396.329s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I would echo what member Ruseau said earlier that getting student feedback certainly at the high school level and I think the middle school level as well I think my question is, to what extent is this survey about the quality of the experiences of the services being provided versus the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1415.896s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the, the, which services should be provided and are going to be used because, you know, the things that we keep hearing about, about overcrowding on the buses or lack of bus monitor or vaping on the middle school bus, those sorts of questions, as you say, distinguishing fact from fiction, how prevalent are these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1434.448s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I saw Megan's hand go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1484.648s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean- I think my question there is to, is it, can we phrase those things in terms of obstacles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1494.949s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are people not putting their kids on the bus because of X, Y, or Z reasons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1501.39s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that phrasing is useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1721.877s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: May I share a map of our school radiuses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1726.18s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1727.021s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1730.563s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So these are our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1734.226s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, my toolbar's in the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1735.947s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1737.228s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1737.568s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is within half a mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1740.69s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the lighter shading is one mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1746.007s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then these dotted lines are the three miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1749.031s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, particularly when we're looking right Fulton Heights I know we do a bus at the high school here, but we've also got a lot of outside the radius for the high school and a lot of these neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1762.126s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: are a particular demographic and so there's a there's a huge equity issue and understanding I love Megan's idea of reaching out specifically to families right the elementary schools have this have these radii but even some of that is not being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1778.618s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: captured in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1780.34s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then there's also, I think, the stigma issue that needs to be talked about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1785.886s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Riding a bus, the kids who are able to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1789.55s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is parking free for high school students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1792.353s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1793.208s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: OK, but that, of course, requires owning a car or having access to a car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1798.874s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I don't know to what extent stigma is informing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1802.517s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You know, we can ask about how would your behavior change if we made these changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1807.782s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But some of it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1809.584s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Some of it is really rooted in, you know what, even if you give me these buses, I wouldn't take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1816.204s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: or even if I knew how to walk to school, I wouldn't, or my family, my parent drives past the school every day, and so they drop me off, and I'm never gonna switch to something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1828.607s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So what we're hoping to accomplish, is there an ideal situation that we want to achieve here, or is it just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1933.94s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that- And that was, that was actually their complaint that there are two buses and they're crowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2842.731s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so they raised five concerns, and I just need to find that tab that has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2848.935s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So there are five concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2851.697s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Where did it go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2852.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Wait, nope, that's your document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2854.039s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This one's my document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2855.78s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2857.641s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2858.262s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2868.956s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it was the student safety in the bus lines, the setting designated arrival and departure position positions to reduce crowding more buses for North Medford and other underserved areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2884.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: five and 10 minutes, and it wasn't consistent as to when the arrival time was, and it wasn't time to accommodate people staying late, so that's your late bus question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2893.193s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the 95, either comes very early, very late, the early bus is very crowded, the late bus doesn't get people to their jobs on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2902.716s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, did I miss anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2920.527s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I think a potential setup is just the baseline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2924.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What do you do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2927.289s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would you like to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2929.91s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or do we have questions about getting fewer people taking buses, more bike pool, more walk pools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2938.553s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But what do you do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2941.502s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would you do if the options were there for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2945.263s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And what are the obstacles to getting to those ideals, whether it's walking, biking, buses, carpools, parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2958.628s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that is how this is shaking out for me in assessing what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2965.948s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would you anticipate doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2967.91s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I want to recognize Megan's point that there's some education around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2972.033s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we could absolutely aim to have fewer cars in the school drop-offs and pickup lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2978.338s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's going to be some education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2979.759s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There's going to be some resistance in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2982.141s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But understanding what the barriers are for walking, biking, carpools, busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2990.008s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: is important, so where you're going, and that's specifically what the obstacles are, or as I asked in the beginning of the call, what could we do to facilitate your ideal situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2999.631s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I think obstacles is probably the way to go on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3004.653s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's what people are experiencing, is they're saying, oh, I'm not doing this because X, Y, or Z. Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3101.838s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: For whatever it's worth, the city, I spoke to Todd Blake, city engineer, and they're saying they're in the process of mapping the school addresses of students who take the bus and kind of looking at which roads are getting the traffic and what kind of shape they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3120.026s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So there's some coordination with the city once we have these results as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3126.169s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But they're interested in understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3130.054s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: especially since I will note that a lot of these neighborhoods have changed since I imagine the last time we did any kind of transportation assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3425.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm noting Megan's comment in the chat here about asking families to sign up for the bus in May this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3430.958s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does that mean there's content you'd like to have ready with that sign up to say, you're not asking for a preliminary survey response or we shouldn't try to push things to meet that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3441.886s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3446.509s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because if this is the moment when everyone's ready to talk about their transportation needs, I don't want to miss an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3510.035s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham, do you know if this kind of assessment for a new high school, would this be a separate effort to understand the needs there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3550.836s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I know building and grounds are separate, separate entities for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=220.526s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I guess we'll go in the order that you called us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=224.088s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So hi everyone, I'm Erika Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=227.029s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am talking to you right now from MIT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=230.471s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I teach science communication here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=232.312s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I've worked in a lot of museums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=233.433s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have background in astronomy and theater and museum education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=237.615s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: all of the disciplines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=238.696s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am interested in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=240.377s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a Medford mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=241.897s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I am very excited about having all of these voices in our conversations about what our schools are going to look like in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=253.523s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you for taking up time after school to be a part of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=257.806s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It is amazingly appreciated by us on the committee and also by your fellow students and teachers and administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=264.809s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=324.198s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, well, let me, can you hear me before I go on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=329.241s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=332.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=333.965s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=334.686s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, hello there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=335.786s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=336.247s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So again, I am Erica Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=338.908s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am talking to you from MIT today where I teach science communication, but I have also worked in museums for the Smithsonian and for MIT's Cancer Research Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=349.876s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a background in astronomy and theater and museum education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=352.778s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I am about all of the things that you study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=355.419s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=356.48s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: so excited about the curriculum components, and I am so grateful to all of you for volunteering your time to be on a part of the school committee in a student advisory capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=367.087s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a Medford mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=368.448s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I just really appreciate this, and I know your classmates, your teachers, the rest of the committee does as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=869.585s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think the other part that needs to be a part of the conversation is understanding some of the motivation for why the policy exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=876.308s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I've, I've heard certainly some concerns around, you know, is this, are we just talking about backpacks, but what about large totes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=882.752s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And there are some equity issues where some student populations are more likely to carry a large tote and some are more likely to carry backpacks and are those being treated the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=891.856s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But is this about the devices that can distract people in class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=895.918s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=897.699s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: an opportunity to not have those devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=900.621s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so how can we make sure that a new policy solves the problems that the initial policy was intended to have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=907.546s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that's the other component.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=909.787s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We see the burden that the policy can place on students, but then taking that away, what are the consequences of that for being in class, for being between classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=922.213s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think there are different concerns during passing than there are in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=925.955s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So just making sure that conversation includes not just the impact on students, but on the entire class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1106.55s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, sounds like you all have a fairly good idea of the issues and the reasons that we want this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1110.571s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I wonder if rather than doing another survey, you might think about once we, you have a proposal for what this would look like, asking people to respond to that specific proposal rather than having another open-ended feedback that comes in, but make it more of a feedback than an input response situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1131.359s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd say here's what we think would solve the problems we know about, what have we forgotten?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1368.222s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If this is the if this is the same Google Doc that was shared in the last meeting, I believe I have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1390.466s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, am I sharing the one that that we had last time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1395.036s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1399.64s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Close that window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2202.205s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2202.686s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was very thoughtful, very well researched, and I appreciate what's gone into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2208.871s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can I ask, have you spoken to any of the school, the faculty, teachers about the alignment, any of your advisors about the alignment with their, with learning goals and course goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2444.696s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would you most like to get from the school committee members who are in the room right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2449.46s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm aware of the time and that there are more things on the agenda and obviously as an educator I have a lot of thoughts on how this all plays out and I don't think this is the moment to go into depth in every point because there's a lot to be discussed and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2463.484s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um, hashed out, but you know, is this something that we would want to schedule a subcommittee meeting with the curriculum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2470.766s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Subcommittee and instruction to, to talk about this with teachers and students in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2476.548s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would be most useful at this point with limited time for, in terms of either in this meeting or next steps that you would like to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2519.764s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2520.064s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's really helpful because I think school committee can set policies and obviously that does take some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2525.309s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: There's a limit to, especially with open meetings, of how fast a fast track is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2531.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But also there's the stipulation that the implementation falls to the schools themselves and we can't tell teachers how to teach, but we can set some of those parameters, whether it's about the homework, about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2545.376s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the expectations per syllabus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2546.956s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: A lot of this seems to be about laying out what are the expectations and knowing what's coming over the course of a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2553.558s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But thank you, that's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2555.659s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see how urgent this is on many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3245.586s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have one question and one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3247.948s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One question is, are these conditions exacerbated during inclement weather?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3252.392s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I ask because I personally am a most seasons biker, and so I'm curious about alternative transportation in terms of biking as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3263.441s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are there more people riding buses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3267.204s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Does the weather affect these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3281.402s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3282.383s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other, the comment that I wanted to make is that this is really good timing to have this meeting because we have a strategic planning subcommittee meeting scheduled for Monday about a district-wide transportation survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3295.072s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so if there are particular questions that you think we ought to be asking more broadly in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3300.055s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would certainly love to receive those from you in anticipation of this meeting on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3308.458s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3309.579s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that can happen over email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3311.84s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not trying to put anyone on the spot, especially at 331.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3446.141s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, it was protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3447.302s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was in that meeting that that those protected bike lanes went away because a lot of people spoke out against having bike lanes on Winthrop Street and the compromise was that the bike lanes not be protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3456.674s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that was because people showed up and fought against protected bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3460.779s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So if this is important, please do continue to show up at meetings to advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3641.115s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for the work in putting it together and for presenting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3644.996s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm gonna ask again, so what are you hoping to get from this group at this time in regards to this document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3824.97s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I asked member Ruseau and Mr. Dalton what kind of protocols need to happen for something like this to be reviewed and put up as an official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3834.578s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is my new member hat going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3838.362s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How would this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3913.005s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4652.494s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to know if this is the first, when, is this the first time these awards have been offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4660.717s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are these inaugural or are they continuing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5929.875s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5931.776s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Didn't we have a motion to request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5934.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think we voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5936.399s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think, I think we did take a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9535.301s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9536.222s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9537.083s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9540.046s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: One, and I know this was in the old policy as well, what if the Secretary is a new member?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9545.772s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that, I mean, a new member can't, and the Secretary's elected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9553.103s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: during that first meeting, at which point the duties have started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9555.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm a little confused about the logistics, but I know this has stood as is for quite a while, so I don't know what to do about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9563.591s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my second question is, there was a phrase removed about non-discrimination, that there's membership on a school committee is not limited to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9576.442s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9637.626s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is covered by the non-discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10107.116s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So some of this used to exist, and then when we moved to Zoom, that became the only online access that was announced in meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10114.023s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is just to say when people go to look at the minutes, they should be able to get to the videos quite easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10120.289s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that it can be difficult to post the individual video links.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10124.874s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I did talk to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10127.608s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Tom about whether or not this would be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10129.85s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: He said it would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10131.291s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But in the absence of that, I would be completely fine with just the link to find previous recordings here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10137.896s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It was suggested that there might be some policy changes required on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10143.02s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I went and I looked at the policies, and they really just describe what's in the minutes and what's in the announcements about time and place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10150.426s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10152.242s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: need to be, doesn't seem to be needing an amendment on the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10156.423s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have that language if we need to add them, but it kind of changes the name of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10160.624s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm happy for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10162.205s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is just about making these things available to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10167.166s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10194.54s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To post, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10196.382s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So we have the agenda and then we have...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10199.98s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then we have the minutes are posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10202.022s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Once the minutes are approved, the minutes go up and it would be easy enough to just add that Zoom link or so I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10208.707s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would be perfectly happy with just a here's where to go and find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10352.7s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that's one part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10353.4s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The other part was about letting people know where they can watch it on cable and through live streams, which, as I said, used to be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10363.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And as somebody who would often tune in and listen to these meetings while I'm dealing with dinner or children, it was helpful to have those links with the meeting info.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10389.608s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think you can just strike and that individual recording links through the end of that sentence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10397.631s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Just archives recordings of Medford Public School Committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10442.603s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10466.202s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because these are the education channels and there's a separate local access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10469.105s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And is it not consistent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10505.844s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: All right, so the live stream to Zoom, though you're saying that our Zooms do get pushed to YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10519.295s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And that link's the same, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10606.777s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10608.138s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was looking at that as the minutes and the notification, but Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10649.625s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't have a strong preference on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10653.989s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My sense is that the people who aren't watching it online want the channel numbers, but... I would, not to be difficult, but I would make a motion to amend to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10678.183s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I would say channel numbers and YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10732.774s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I will also say that these meetings, sorry, the notice is posted to the website where we have agreed to put that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10740.017s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that link exists where meeting notification exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10743.318s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't need that link on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10746.311s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think the channels make sense on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10748.912s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so no YouTube link, just the channel numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10751.473s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12195.273s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: incidents with the police report or the number of police reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12197.934s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because my understanding is there are sometimes multiple police reports filed around a single incident or is an incident defined as one student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12275.56s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12276.26s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to offer an amendment that the rate cards be accompanied by a historical perspective for these funds or history or for those that are recommending a rate change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12290.366s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know which one is more appropriate here, general history or just those with a change in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12387.23s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=88.632s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=815.094s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=815.835s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=816.075s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=817.396s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to thank Jerry again for being proactive and say, don't be embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=821.059s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We'd rather get the information sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=822.641s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2470.117s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2472.078s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I am curious when the lags will catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2476.36s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So when we'll know whether these numbers are lasting or temporary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2482.003s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I guess my other question is what ability do we have to see what the trends are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2486.985s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm seeing a lot of net losses and I'm curious how many of those are perpetuating from year to year and how many are anomalies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2676.264s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: For this cycle or for what's the timing on looking at that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3058.439s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3059.159s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what's happening with potential budget presentation by Tracy Novick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3065.303s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's a math school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3081.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3081.993s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's super key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3102.384s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4434.422s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I had one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4436.784s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see in here that meals are the responsibility of the travelers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4441.469s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a plan in place if there are students for whom that could pose a hardship to cover that in a sensitive, discreet way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4477.731s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And how many, yes, how many students are on the team here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4799.651s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think we can move ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6021.206s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6022.067s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I'm wondering how our programs compare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6024.81s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I love that you've had this meeting and that you're moving forward with the other programs in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6029.916s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I tried to do a little bit of research and I see that our rates are on par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6032.86s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do they also have waitlists of similar sizes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6057.282s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then are there other, so you said in the current schools, you're using the cafeterias,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6066.386s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the libraries, the gyms, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6068.147s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm a museum educator by training, so I'm familiar with the informal or unstructured learning environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6076.671s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What are the options elsewhere in the district, kind of beyond elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6082.714s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What would we need to run that sort of program somewhere else or for someone to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6151.144s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I recognize staffing is certainly an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6154.248s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are you competing with these other programs in Medford for staffing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6157.371s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is everyone trying to hire the same people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6631.888s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6633.109s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6634.089s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6634.329s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Could you give us a sense of how the waitlist has grown, what the trend is here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6640.27s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is it getting, I assume it's getting bigger or is it leveling off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6701.674s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'd be really curious to see that as long as along with the numbers of percentage of people who are declining waitlist spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6709.937s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think if that's changing as well, that tells us something about how people are filling their needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6729.713s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, because I think you're absolutely right that the raw numbers don't tell the whole story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6734.556s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so what are the key metrics here to understand how we are or are not meeting the need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6740.48s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Because we hear a lot of anecdotes and what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6743.806s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what's true across the district or in specific schools be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6810.906s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then one more, you may not have this answer until the end of the year, until next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6815.109s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So Ready, Set, Kids is a new program that was kind of formed in response to some of the challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6821.434s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Has it helped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6879.98s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I know that's one difference in between, I know you said these problems are not unique to Medford, but I think there are communities around us that have many more options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6899.867s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I live next door to that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6901.667s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I see the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9502.18s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9503.08s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9503.821s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was wondering if we could reorder things in the definition section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9507.722s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The rest of this protocol does a great job of going from progressively, introducing progressively more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9515.758s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: extreme conditions and I found myself jumping around and reading it backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9522.905s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: With the definitions that the outlook is kind of the first stage and then we're looking at the watches or the advisory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9543.327s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: But I think if we flip them, it'll make it more... I think the goal here was perhaps to make the excessive, the most extreme thing first, so we see that first, but it felt really inconsistent with... I'm happy to flip it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9557.918s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=0.049s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=0.109s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or refer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2.73s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=4.471s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=6.372s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: To Medford's Office of Sustainable Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=8.554s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know our climate action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=11.715s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: References lead only, um, but either or invite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=16.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The sustainable someone from the sustainability office at the city to comment on that as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=39.998s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It's CHPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=43.061s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I can put that in the document, I think, if that's useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=47.014s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=48.034s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I didn't have time to do the research, but from what I've seen, it seems like there are some really important milestones for schools that we should be thinking about as people using the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=124.993s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=125.554s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's perhaps then included in one of the consultancies that the next section is gonna refer to to make sure that we have that consultancy in submitting our application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=402.432s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, the or was simply because I haven't, I didn't have the time to do the research, but I'm going to trust the experts in the inboxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=415.574s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Or I accept your revision to my amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=452.715s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=454.976s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1068.141s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1069.723s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I support the idea of alternates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1073.026s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: My big question on that is, if we lose committee members, we're going to need to, for the most part, replace that particular expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1082.314s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think this is a little bit what Member Ruseau was referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1086.277s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so being really thoughtful about what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1091.542s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: because the building committee is we're choosing this not by lottery not we're choosing it very much based on expertise and I but I think it could certainly be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1101.733s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I guess my question to the superintendent is this for specifically for the members of the public or are we thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1110.603s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: the designated voting members who are actively fulfilling particular roles because I think if it's for the public, we can add a question to the application saying, would you be willing to serve as an alternate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1122.857s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then we would need to specify that the alternates are essentially a non, are they a non participatory but non voting member during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1130.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: and they move into a voting role, or is it they're observers for the whole process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1136.808s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So what does it mean to be an alternate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1611.562s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to put into this document the procedure for filling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1617.173s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: vacancies that arise, or is that something that the committee, the original appointed committee will say, if we lose members, this is our replacement plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1672.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and I because I agree with the process that member Ruseau out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1677.061s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it was member Ruseau outlined if we go back if that expertise is there we take it there or give that first refusal, and then put out a call for specific expertise if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1748.447s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, we did not address the question of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1753.312s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hodgkin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1755.214s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1756.615s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I would certainly support putting her as a non-voting member in the same capacity as Principal Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1767.485s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It does bring us to an even number, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1771.3s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: may or may not, although not voting, not on the voting, just in the room, I guess it's just pushing the numbers up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1778.184s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are we like, and I was also looking back, is MEEP represented in Medford Family Network?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1784.288s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How are those, when we're talking about all the programs in the building, how are those represented here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1798.789s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And thank you for being here, how you come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1831.625s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Fantastic, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1869.913s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1875.438s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2064.804s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2065.986s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We need to add email address or phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2068.909s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How do we contact these people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2070.912s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2085.435s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2085.876s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then do we want to know if they are a teacher or staff at a different school in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2094.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We have high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2098.19s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was torn on this, and so I... I guess that's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2160.348s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If it were me, I'd be putting it in other relevant or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2165.669s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I want to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2167.831s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And just to make sure, just to confirm that Medford High School encompasses vocational actually, and I suppose Curtis Tufts as well, because we are looking at whether or not this becomes one facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2196.428s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2628.97s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Not to the application, I just want to make sure that the application is posted with the necessary context of the goals of the committee that I think is outlined early on, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2640.333s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It can't just be a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2642.313s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Perhaps it's a resolution and that explains what our goals are and who they're joining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2659.564s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: before I think I think the goals that we outlined are really helpful to say this is this is what this committee is looking to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2666.166s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And yeah, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2668.926s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2682.689s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And the shifting of the numbers with the addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2685.834s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2686.755s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2792.697s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I worry a little bit about getting all community members up to speed on Robert's rules of order, but if that's how open meeting has to be, that's how it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3072.336s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question for Dr. Dr Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3075.477s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering what the status of the project website is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3079.739s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: As per the last resolution to set that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3112.474s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It wasn't when we wrote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=321.391s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So this is partly a procedural question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=325.921s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we ask comments about the job description that's written, or is this just a pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=334.245s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Has this been posted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=341.828s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I had a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=343.429s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Just a question around the practice of salary measure of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=348.151s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Do we ever post salary ranges for things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=351.073s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=352.853s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Measure it for with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=354.878s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: We don't post salary ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=357.619s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=358.099s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that's a, that's a different conversation then about practices around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=362.76s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Um, and then I was, I just wanted to ask about it's in the knowledge of progressive approach to enhance student dining experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=370.963s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm curious what that means and whether that means culturally inclusive or culturally sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=377.925s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering if that language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=381.172s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: can be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=382.493s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Progressive feels very big to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=469.727s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: or to add culturally inclusive in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1497.718s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1499.1s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The question about community vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1501.362s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of a regular election cycle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1503.385s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a special election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1504.526s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2559.515s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I was gonna motion to approve, but I'll second, that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2565.457s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2566.158s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are you not done, Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3661.053s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am curious what expertise we already have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3665.176s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Like I pretty sure we don't have people in the district who have been through a new construction process and that feels for new construction in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3677.487s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm curious what the expertise is and where our gaps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3682.17s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other thing that I wanted to say is I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3685.811s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Defining the committee, I like the idea of starting with what we need and being really clear about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3690.953s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think putting that in addition to the committee, just the process of here are some key milestones for that community input at these stages is really going to be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3701.198s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And these are the points when we will evaluate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3702.839s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is the committee shifting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3705.8s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Are we rotating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3707.702s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: this position or that position, but I would like to know what expertise we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3713.104s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The requirements say one principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3714.805s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I feel like if we're talking about the Medford High School vocational combination, we actually need two principals there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3721.408s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So that kind of conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3723.588s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How big is our committee of people that we already have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3766.506s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then what are the gaps there that we would need for the core committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3769.809s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What needs to be filled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4352.788s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, to be a little bit clearer in terms of my saying what are our gaps, I think we should potentially be looking to fill particular functions and roles on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4362.835s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think absolutely representation is important, but what is it that we need to do to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4368.579s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is a very logistical process, and particularly at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4373.142s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: certain stages and in terms of educating the community about what this is, I would hate for us to run around finding all the things we could tell them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4382.488s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think an FAQ would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4386.01s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: What are the frequent questions we're getting and put together an answer on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4390.232s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I do think there should be absolutely points for community input throughout the process, but perhaps in this initial stage, what are the key things that people are asking and that they want to know similar to what we did around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4402.611s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I hate to make the comparison to COVID, but there was a very soliciting input and then hopefully answering those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4411.334s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4411.674s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4458.055s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5587.493s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5587.973s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5607.67s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I am willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5608.57s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I defer to a member who is willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5612.633s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: If anyone is gung ho, they can have it, but I'm absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5628.802s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: That's going to be your excuse for everything now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5699.019s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1927.216s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1930.118s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1931.959s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1932.88s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm new to school committee, so I haven't seen the presentations other than in passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1937.963s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I have a couple of questions and I'll start with the accelerated math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.027s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.467s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So my big question here is what is differentiation gonna look like in the seventh grade now that there's going to be a broader range of skills and abilities and comfort with math?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1956.141s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And how are teachers going to be supported in meeting those wider needs without the trust?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2046.021s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And they have the opportunity to do some of the vertical integration talking to the grade below and the grade ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2071.252s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I have questions about the integrated math, but if any of my colleagues have things on the middle school, I want to make sure we can keep that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2787.039s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Member Redfield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2788.739s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So, Member Graham touched on my questions about education for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2793.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so a small question is, what kind of support is going to be available for students coming in from other districts who have had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2800.575s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: who were coming from the traditional path into the integrated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2894.287s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I will say, I love the spiral model of education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2896.928s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's much more effective than the latter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2900.225s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So my next question is around that kind of interdisciplinary perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2903.666s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I know you've had a lot of conversation within the math department and digital learning, and how does this intersect with, say, the science courses, you know, chemistry, physics, where a lot of these concepts are coming into play, and at the vocational school, things like metalwork and carpentry, where that geometry foundation, and as much as I hate to reference standardized tests, academic milestones like the SATs, which lean really hard into the geometry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2931.089s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So how is that being integrated kind of beyond the math department and making sure that those intersections, those alignments are matching up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3006.929s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3007.149s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And will they have the opportunity to do that peer-to-peer professional development in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3011.93s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This is what worked for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3012.83s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This was my challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3013.751s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: How can we help each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3055.412s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Well, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3056.172s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thanks to your work and thank the committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3058.414s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know it's a lot on top of teaching to be thinking about that at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8987.268s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8991.849s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So most of my questions were addressed particularly around the triggering of, you know, is this predicted heat for three days or is this actual because after three days it's already been excessive heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9003.152s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I almost can't believe I'm asking this and this is to Member Ruseau's point about conversations we keep having over and over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9009.974s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Encouraging hydration bathroom policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9015.208s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there something built in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9016.389s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know this has been controversial across the district about access to bathrooms, but when we're encouraging hydration, this is going to impact that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9025.536s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Is there something we need to be considering on that front?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9030.6s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: At the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9032.881s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I haven't heard problems at other schools, but I do know frequency of students using the bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9040.199s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I've heard it disruptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9041.319s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I know it's disruptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9043.32s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone trying to leave the house with a child knows it's disruptive, but just what that looks like in the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9051.822s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my other point is the acknowledgement of the services that school provide, but also perhaps an acknowledgement that many home environments are also unsafe in excessive heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9089.763s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9090.564s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10319.738s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10320.118s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10321.923s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if this is a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10323.804s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I think our policy is that we don't meet in August unless there's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10328.688s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know if there are implications there in terms of a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10334.032s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I think my question is, I would really like to know the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10339.796s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds like there are school updates in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10342.398s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know budget season is June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10344.88s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I'd love to see budget conversations happen earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10348.182s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And so are we looking at mapping out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10351.346s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what a typical year looks like or what a specific year looks like here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10357.068s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10404.267s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then my other question was just how does this intersect with the meeting we're having in two days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10408.729s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I would certainly favor it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10411.784s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: looking at this after I've kind of seen what a report cycle, what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10417.407s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Right, because the reports and the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10618.011s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: The email was sent on January 19th from Lisa requesting, I got an email on January 19th requesting the Committee of the Whole for January 31st at 5 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10628.294s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Specific to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10629.794s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I got the calendar specific to this to discuss requested reports for the remainder of the year to be held on January 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10638.137s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I got the calendar invitation on January 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10802.767s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Can we can I I'm not sure if this is an amendment to it but I have some things that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10808.359s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: would also like to see in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10810.04s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10811.001s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I would like to see an assessment of how many or how much time full-time and part-time staff are spending covering when we don't have subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10823.911s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You know, we just heard about an assistant principal who's coming in to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10827.513s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I've heard of co-teachers being pulled into another classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10831.596s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I would really like to understand what services are not being provided or what work isn't getting done when we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10838.297s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: cobbling together a substitute situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10840.899s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And the goal of, and I don't know if that's one of the key questions in the beginning, but the goal on that is to, I really appreciate the specificity of what is the need, what is the cost, what's it going to cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10854.711s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: This to me is, what's it going to cost us if we don't fix the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10858.715s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: So I'd like to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10860.536s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then I don't have a great sense of what our history as a district is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10865.529s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: in terms of long-term subs and building subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10869.61s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that has fallen in and out of existence as people have and have not become available over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10878.732s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I know I had a student whose teacher, we had two maternity leaves in the same year and one of them had a long-term sub and the other had a cobbled together situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10887.694s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: And then our building, an elementary school had a building sub and then they didn't and so understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10894.195s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: what that looked like when those things were in place and when they haven't been, or even just what dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=360.851s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=363.452s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=796.65s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was curious, is there on our, I think there's a shared Google Drive that we got access to today, is there, does that have the archive of the meetings and kind of agendas of what these committees have done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=808.719s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=810.421s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1029.712s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: You did tell us our first meeting we attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1080.863s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever the minutes from December 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1103.656s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1114.483s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve these with the correction of the spelling of my name.<br><br>
