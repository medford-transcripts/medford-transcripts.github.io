    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1566.357s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: from Florida and the representative of the design firm which presented to us a preliminary schema which was required for the application of this grant on making improvements to a park that's part of a vital neighborhood within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1586.135s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's an innovative design that follows upon and incorporates many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1593.21s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: new features that one finds in parks in the United States today, which also benefit from federal funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1601.296s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, the features were enumerated for us at the meeting the other night to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1608.822s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't want to belabor them, but this is a phase one, if I understood correctly, of the implementation plan that will not take into account any significant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1621.543s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: embellishments to the basketball and tennis courts, nor to the baseball field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1626.724s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But we'll take into account other areas of the park and also add special features.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1633.006s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I approve of this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1635.627s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If there is a neighborhood in Medford, and I'm sure my colleague to the right will attest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1641.289s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: where there's vitality, families who are staying in this community, living in this community, and multi-generational families there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1650.351s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's the neighborhood around Harris Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1653.632s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I think this would be a wonderful addition and improvement to our community, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6088.651s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Move that we adopt the committee report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6092.452s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and approve the expenditure of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6689.907s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think we should wait and discuss this in committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6694.828s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We've set principles behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6697.16s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Even just tonight, an hour and a half ago, we delayed and chose not to vote on two outstanding citizens to be replaced on a board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6710.706s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They had been thoroughly vetted, not only by the general public, but by their peers and by this body before, yet we're making them wait a week to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6722.95s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The people who work for the city are required, once they've negotiated their salaries through the union process, ordinance change is required to expend on those salary increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6740.056s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Year after year, we make them wait nearly two months<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6745.225s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to get their raises, thus raising their taxes on their retro pay, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6750.869s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If we're going to go through those lengths, with all due respect for this expenditure, I think it should stand the test of process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7256.069s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Can we take any other one if we feel impelled, if it's an urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7263.775s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Sure you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7264.856s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: These aren't subject to petitioners, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7267.538s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7775.385s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm offended that someone would suggest that we're punishing anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7859.815s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8199.679s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I know this is a touchy issue, and I am grateful for Councilor Scarpelli to take, for taking such leadership on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8209.481s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have yet to make up my mind how I want to approach this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8213.241s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm grateful that Councilor Scarpelli has done such<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8216.633s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: extensive research on the matter and spoken to so many people in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8221.999s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: On face value, it seems almost innocuous, but I think it's going to need further discussion, further conversation, and as one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8243.47s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I look forward to that dialogue as we address this issue and hope I can educate myself and hear from more citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8253.133s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've heard from some, but as we're moving forward on this, that we hear from more citizens and make a wise decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1792.599s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just as a comment, Mr. President, some years, over 25 years ago, one of my former confreres had graduated from the Sorbonne in France, and the treasurer of the college went to his graduation and noticed that the city of Paris used a special cast-iron public trash barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1812.989s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He somehow contacted the director of the DPW of the city of Paris, or the director or commissioner de sanitaire, found out where those cast iron barrels were made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1828.615s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He ordered them and put them all over the college campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1833.337s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 25 years later, undented and only with a second coat of paint, they still function very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3967.468s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A number of things have been brought up by some of the Councilors that I'm concerned of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3995.079s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't want to vilify anyone, Mr. Superintendent, but I can't imagine in my mind how one mislays something so important, critical, and apparently dangerous that's in a school building as bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4558.231s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4559.212s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think we need to be certain of our intentions here because we're committing ourselves to a portion of this project needs and there still remains a balance of $176,000, $177,000 nearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4582.298s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm correct in reading this 217 that we've been informed by someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6032.603s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Under Mayor Burke, we've probably spent a good portion of it down on this type of stuff, the type of stuff of parks, public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=4964.456s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A yes vote would not adopt the open space discount, am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=4981.762s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That is the motion, yay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=161.169s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, we've had, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, quite extensive meetings, and we've gotten a lot of answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=170.413s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We've gotten a lot of response and thoughtful responses to the questions that we've asked on behalf of the citizens regarding this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=180.598s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Uh, we've also, uh, uh, I think, uh, the representatives of, um, Eversource and the, um, uh, their, uh, uh, contractor who's going to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=195.766s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: execute the project, have listened seriously and intently to the concerns of the council regarding the citizens and what they want regarding traffic, regarding safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=210.431s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we also dealt in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=221.434s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and the city administration and various department heads who have expertise in these matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=229.459s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And although we were able to make some inroads and renegotiate some of the aspects of the Yalta conference, Mr. President, I'm satisfied as one Councilor to have heard everything satisfactorily that concerns me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=249.55s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: approve of this project of the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=253.136s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1079.028s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1080.049s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just briefly, on that note, as you remember early on in the process, 13 years ago, that was one of the major concerns that I think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1094.535s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: who administer projects like this sometimes become, because they live in a world of email communication, sometimes lose track of the fact that not everybody lives on that planet, and that we're dealing with a bigger solar system, and so various modes of communication have to be employed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1112.131s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's why we sent that letter out to the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1140.073s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: While we're on suspension?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1141.85s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: While we're in the suspension, some citizens on Winchester Street would like to address the council regarding a matter that we all received notice on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1697.794s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1698.935s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1700.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the Building Commissioner, Mr. Moki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1712.047s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Clearly, upon all the research you've done, Fran,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1717.172s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: that the activity that's going on is beyond the scope allowed in the initial variance given to the property owner some 20 plus years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1729.454s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The property owner's not in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1731.034s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He leased the property out to a company that's clearly operating way beyond the scope of the restrictions placed on the use of that property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1743.577s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They are in the process from what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1747.135s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Building Commissioner has told me they are in the process of finding a new location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1752.799s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: However, he doesn't have an answer on when that's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1757.382s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's what has him concerned the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1760.324s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1766.688s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I just want peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1779.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Here's what it is at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1781.741s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: First of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1786.145s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: White.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1789.043s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1792.625s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They do enormous projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1796.308s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1802.832s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And they're not treating you well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1805.014s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1809.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Moki has examined this and cited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1817.984s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: the property owner for a zoning violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1820.586s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So a citation has been issued, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1823.887s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1831.951s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Hopefully this will be resolved before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1835.433s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He personally met with the manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1844.39s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1849.934s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So they themselves have been put on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1853.497s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He's assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1863.485s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to survey the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1865.166s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He wanted you to be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1867.266s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And then this is going to have to follow its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1871.748s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1882.331s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because he doesn't want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1884.352s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That reflects poorly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1886.372s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1898.3s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1898.58s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1901.542s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Like it's kind of been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1902.843s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1905.866s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The trucks left for the day on their projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1909.268s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1909.969s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So that's where I've been updated on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1913.993s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1924.644s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But that's where he has us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1927.867s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1932.07s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But this is important, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1934.392s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as Councilors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1949.671s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I know you, friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1950.591s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I mean, you're not a complainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1953.094s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I just want to sleep peacefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4539.048s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4540.889s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4543.63s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If I could, through the chair, say thank you, Commissioner, for bringing this forward and taking the course of action that you're taking in repairing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4554.175s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think it's an appropriate use of this money, and it's going to go a long way in giving a good quality of life to the citizens there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4564.582s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4565.022s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I know your staff does excellent work in communicating to the neighbors what they're going to encounter in these projects, and I can only foresee this going well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4579.09s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4580.271s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Good luck, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4581.872s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Chairman, move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=54.118s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=58.984s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=65.378s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=80.225s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so there is an additional couple weeks people have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=84.347s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They should check out the resources and to their new deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=90.65s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=357.053s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1737.923s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor DelaRusso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1739.164s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1741.285s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1749.978s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1754.5s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Their agenda is to get Medford into municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1758.663s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1767.087s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1777.393s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1780.383s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1786.828s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1796.195s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1804.602s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They have something to gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1806.417s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Obviously always someone has something to gain and there's nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1812.311s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think this is a stretch in some areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1814.623s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1824.607s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: What does this do to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1826.188s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Does this target them in some way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1827.769s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Who has an access to this list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1829.85s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1835.652s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: These are questions, serious questions that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1839.194s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1843.133s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They need a voice as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1845.014s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm going to give them that voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1847.055s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1850.137s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think we need to have further discussion on municipal law, uh, aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1854.24s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we need to have a credible bonafide expert on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1860.363s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Who's going to give, uh, the argument contra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1864.425s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2362.986s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2363.206s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2756.907s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Also, the board has a memorandum that wouldn't be renegotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2975.1s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2988.222s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=2994.825s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=3010.547s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Would you like me to read the communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=3012.749s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I wish you wouldn't, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=3014.43s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We debated it extensively last week and we had a lot of words from those in favor from the gallery, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=54.144s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=59.005s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=80.27s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so there is an additional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=82.911s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A couple weeks, people have, they should check out the resources and to their new deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=90.692s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=102.674s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=357.087s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1739.186s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1741.306s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1750.017s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1754.539s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Their agenda is to get METFIT into municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1758.701s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1767.124s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1777.428s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1780.404s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1786.87s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1796.238s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1804.626s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They have something to gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1806.46s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Obviously, always someone has something to gain, and there's nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1812.323s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think this is a stretch in some areas, and I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1824.629s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: What does this do to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1826.229s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Does this target them in some way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1827.81s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Who has an access to this list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1829.878s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1834.281s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Um, these are questions, uh, serious questions that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1839.225s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President, that they need a voice as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1845.069s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm going to give them that voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1847.09s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1850.192s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think we need to have further discussion on municipal, uh, aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1854.275s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we need to have a credible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1864.46s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2988.262s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2994.864s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=647.196s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have a little R after my name, so I'm the last person that wants to see people taxed, especially when they get taxed that come up from behind them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=659.019s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So this could be construed at that, but I would want to hear an explanation about this from either the treasurer or Aleesha Nunley on what our expenses are and how this is something that can, if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=828.465s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: is that we have certainly a lot of hasty driving there that has resulted in a number of bad situations, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gnut-gH1atc&t=837.293s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think that would be a good place for that monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=697.685s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I want to also extend my thanks to Councilor Marks for bringing this matter up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=702.548s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If my memory serves me correctly, I think it was President Emeritus Mayorko<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=707.294s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: several years ago had suggested an ordinance to deal with graffiti, and I think it got tied down in committee, and one of the sticking points to it, if my memory serves me right, was that this would sometimes, in dealing with the graffiti, one of the things that you've addressed in this is that it can often place the victims of graffiti, the property owner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=734.798s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: also has the additional burden of finding a way to deal with this, get the graffiti cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=741.903s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And for some people, whether they might own a home or a place of business, the cleanup of such an act is also a burden and may not be covered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=753.368s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: under their homeowners or business insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=757.13s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Um, so I, I'm glad that, uh, in your proposal, we have a remedy for that and, uh, you can count on my support as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3751.048s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Could I amend the motion, whatever it may be, to include a request to the mayor's office to provide each member of the Medford City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3764.261s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: with a copy of the signed document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3793.001s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So is there a particular manner we'd like to get this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3795.823s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'd prefer paper rather than a petroleum-based product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4599.508s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I was in Boston this afternoon on business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4602.75s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I had a meeting on Washington Street in the south end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4607.813s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's a park there, a dog park, right there on Washington Street, just between where the Herald was and where the cathedral is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4616.959s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's a little dog park that's not much bigger than the area behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4623.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Simple, clean, place for people to gather, let the dogs run around, play, intermingle, do whatever it is that they do, and you go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4633.885s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's a very simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4635.266s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's not elaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4636.948s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It doesn't have Carrara marble colonnades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4641.812s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's a chain link fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4643.653s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's got the gravel that it needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4645.315s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's got water spigots for the dogs to drink out of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4648.177s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4649.078s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And a couple benches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4650.379s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And what's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4653.636s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Refuse bags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4655.598s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6011.274s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: helpful rather than speculating to invite them down before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6014.637s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if we should call it a public hearing, but have them appear before the council for the purpose of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6021.543s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You know, this should be done regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6024.166s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Uh, excuse me for going over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6026.187s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This should be done regularly with any number of issues within this community to refresh people's memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6059.737s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He's a gem in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6061.117s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I don't see any reason why on earth that he wouldn't come down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6065.168s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to have a conversation, not to be cross-examined and prosecuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6951.003s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6952.003s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Knight's recommendation is the wise one and the wise course we should follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6958.087s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: In subcommittee then that gives us the opportunity to be a little more conversational with the members of the board to get questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6965.231s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We can convene in council, have further deliberations among us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6971.437s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and then if we need to call them back, to ask them to come back to address further concerns, and take it from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6979.199s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's an exceptionally wise course, and I think Councilor Penta's bringing this to our attention is important for us to have this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8273.972s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just an interesting statistic, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8276.534s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: According to the official directory of 1950 for the Massachusetts Police Association, Medford at that time had a chief, two captains, five lieutenants, 10 sergeants, and 93 patrolmen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8292.325s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=77.672s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I agree with that 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=82.341s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: uh, chiming in here is because Medford street was mentioned, uh, which seems to be more of a gravel path these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=90.924s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm wondering if, uh, if the council wouldn't mind me amending this to include that the DPW commissioner, uh, uh, examine ways that we can perhaps resurface Medford street on the motion of council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=158.281s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's completely germane to the Green Line project and would greatly enhance quality of life visitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=165.767s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Even if you look at the quality of some of the sidewalks in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=172.121s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't like to be critical, but I mean, a lot of them are just lacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=176.503s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And it needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=178.865s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We also, I'm sure we all received the same email this weekend that I know a group of neighbors up there had done really tremendous work in addressing some sanitation and rodent issues up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=194.573s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we've seen additional infractions happening on the other side of the border.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=201.681s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: you know, this is an area that a neighborhood that needs attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=206.905s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I know a lot of the side streets up there have gotten some over the past couple of years as far as resurfacing, resurfacing, new pipes, sidewalks, and I'd love to see that continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=318.946s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=319.767s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So there's some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=323.431s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I didn't mean to interrupt either one of you, but, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=326.502s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I do have to point out that even though, and I agree the crosswalks are faded and in need of attention, but you know, throughout the summer season, the staff at the Tufts pool does a wonderful job at putting up barriers and cones and really bringing attention and focus on the pedestrian traffic in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=348.554s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So this can only help their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1124.229s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I just want to commend Councilor Caraviello in suggesting that a committee be appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1129.473s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's a wonderful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1130.213s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You know, I spoke tonight up at the pool when we were examining that and the need to encourage opportunities when the pool is restored for people to participate in that as far as exercising leadership in the maintenance and operation of the pool facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1149.056s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And again, because those oftentimes bring out the best in people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1154.463s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And having enthusiasts for dogs and pets to participate in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1162.142s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: uh, establishing this, uh, new facility in the city, uh, for, for the dogs and, and for them to have their exercise and ability to, uh, uh, perhaps live, uh, in a more unrestrained way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1175.046s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think it's wonderful opportunity for people to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1177.527s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1179.608s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And, uh, I lend my support to this, uh, uh, motion, Mr. President on the motion as amended when a roll call vote on the roll, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1750.091s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just a point of information, Mr. President, and maybe Councilor Penta could refresh my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1756.735s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: When was the Judge Jackson report issued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1767.26s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3501.579s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3502.78s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3504.161s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3505.602s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: still the contracted auditor for the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3511.725s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4580.531s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4581.792s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, uh, Mr. President and council along the current, uh, uh, presents a, uh, a very worthwhile resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4589.518s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We, uh, maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4592.281s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if it was Mrs. Burke or in Baker, our auditor, prepared annually for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4602.567s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think maybe Stephanie always used to ask for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4606.43s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It was a sheet that showed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4609.258s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: all the bond indebtedness that we had, but it rolled out 30 years, and it showed us when something was going to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4617.972s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It was a very helpful tool for us to examine everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4624.594s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It had big items on there that we're still paying off, some of the schools and all that type of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4629.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And then some smaller, bigger items, like every time we have to drop several hundred thousand dollars on a new fire truck, things that we'd bond maybe for a shorter term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4640.51s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So, I think it would be very helpful in us looking at that, and I agree with Councilor Penter in the sense that we need to be updated on where we are with the city yard, what's going on with that, and most especially with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4657.916s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The last meeting we had on that several months ago, it was still called out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4663.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we're waiting for an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4666.567s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I know sometimes getting engineer studies and soil samples and all that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4671.497s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It takes time to compile and pull together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4674.578s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But, you know, the scenario, tentative scenario that was laid out for us for the police station wasn't something that was pleasing to me, I must say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4684.621s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'd really like to see where we are with that before we get too far in something that maybe more than one of us will find disagreeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4698.024s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right in asking for this update as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4706.188s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We do have aspects of the pool that are time sensitive, and I know access issues are very important to an awful lot of us, but that doesn't mean we can't proceed while examining, straightening that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4724.304s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I'm grateful for all of that, and I hope that we can make progress on this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5264.578s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If I could, through the chair, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5267.239s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Rosen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5270.894s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So you pointed out a way of presenting budget and analyzing how each department finishes out each year, how it spent its money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5285.542s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And oftentimes when we get to the end of the year, we do so without doing so in that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5295.424s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Department X has $30,000 left over that it didn't spend, and it's the last week in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5302.827s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So we're going to take that money and throw it into Department Y, who overspent $60,000, and hope let's try to find the other 30 somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5316.792s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Vis-a-vis the whole capital improvement program, which I think is built into our budget as far as our indebtedness,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.01s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: throughout the S.Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.75s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: debt service each year is budgeted, because we know that's going to be what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5332.912s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: How do you think we can then better improve the budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5464.031s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So starting out with the budget, because I sit on a board for the non-profit, and when we go through our annual budget, we do a projection that we know we're going to have this to work with, X. And then we build to that goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5480.843s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And part of that goal in the non-profit is an aspect of fundraising for operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5485.426s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But nonetheless, we meet that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5489.614s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think I've often thought that that might be a more helpful way of doing what we do here, though it's tough because there's so much unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5500.518s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: However, I think that sort of a, and we had talked about this as a group, and I'm sure you remember as far as when we've, several years ago, when we got up to the point of this capital improvement program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5519.216s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: that as a council we had envisioned a visioning process that would be collaborative and something that would have open communication, clarity in goals that we then come to agreement on and reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5541.587s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think to a degree, we did that without going through that process, because the way government communicates in Medford isn't what one may describe as healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5557.539s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5558.96s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think what you're trying to say, or what you are saying, is, well, then let's do that in a healthy, transparent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5569.87s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: involves participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8225.599s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, this gentleman, whose resume we've seen in the past, is a great citizen, a great patriot, and a great financier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8238.801s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I second the approval offered by Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8273.328s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: By point of information, remind the Councilors that we have in the past been in receipt of his resume.<br><br>
