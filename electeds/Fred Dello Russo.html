    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1566.357s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: from Florida and the representative of the design firm which presented to us a preliminary schema which was required for the application of this grant on making improvements to a park that's part of a vital neighborhood within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1586.135s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's an innovative design that follows upon and incorporates many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1593.21s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: new features that one finds in parks in the United States today, which also benefit from federal funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1601.296s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, the features were enumerated for us at the meeting the other night to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1608.822s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't want to belabor them, but this is a phase one, if I understood correctly, of the implementation plan that will not take into account any significant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1621.543s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: embellishments to the basketball and tennis courts, nor to the baseball field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1626.724s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But we'll take into account other areas of the park and also add special features.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1633.006s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I approve of this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1635.627s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If there is a neighborhood in Medford, and I'm sure my colleague to the right will attest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1641.289s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: where there's vitality, families who are staying in this community, living in this community, and multi-generational families there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1650.351s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's the neighborhood around Harris Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1653.632s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I think this would be a wonderful addition and improvement to our community, and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6088.651s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Move that we adopt the committee report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6092.452s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and approve the expenditure of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6689.907s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think we should wait and discuss this in committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6694.828s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We've set principles behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6697.16s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Even just tonight, an hour and a half ago, we delayed and chose not to vote on two outstanding citizens to be replaced on a board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6710.706s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They had been thoroughly vetted, not only by the general public, but by their peers and by this body before, yet we're making them wait a week to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6722.95s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The people who work for the city are required, once they've negotiated their salaries through the union process, ordinance change is required to expend on those salary increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6740.056s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Year after year, we make them wait nearly two months<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6745.225s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to get their raises, thus raising their taxes on their retro pay, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6750.869s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If we're going to go through those lengths, with all due respect for this expenditure, I think it should stand the test of process, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7256.069s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Can we take any other one if we feel impelled, if it's an urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7263.775s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Sure you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7264.856s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: These aren't subject to petitioners, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7267.538s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7775.385s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm offended that someone would suggest that we're punishing anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7859.815s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8199.679s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I know this is a touchy issue, and I am grateful for Councilor Scarpelli to take, for taking such leadership on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8209.481s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have yet to make up my mind how I want to approach this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8213.241s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm grateful that Councilor Scarpelli has done such<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8216.633s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: extensive research on the matter and spoken to so many people in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8221.999s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: On face value, it seems almost innocuous, but I think it's going to need further discussion, further conversation, and as one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8243.47s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I look forward to that dialogue as we address this issue and hope I can educate myself and hear from more citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8253.133s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've heard from some, but as we're moving forward on this, that we hear from more citizens and make a wise decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1792.599s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just as a comment, Mr. President, some years, over 25 years ago, one of my former confreres had graduated from the Sorbonne in France, and the treasurer of the college went to his graduation and noticed that the city of Paris used a special cast-iron public trash barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1812.989s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He somehow contacted the director of the DPW of the city of Paris, or the director or commissioner de sanitaire, found out where those cast iron barrels were made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1828.615s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He ordered them and put them all over the college campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=1833.337s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 25 years later, undented and only with a second coat of paint, they still function very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3967.468s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A number of things have been brought up by some of the Councilors that I'm concerned of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3995.079s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't want to vilify anyone, Mr. Superintendent, but I can't imagine in my mind how one mislays something so important, critical, and apparently dangerous that's in a school building as bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4558.231s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4559.212s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think we need to be certain of our intentions here because we're committing ourselves to a portion of this project needs and there still remains a balance of $176,000, $177,000 nearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4582.298s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm correct in reading this 217 that we've been informed by someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6032.603s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Under Mayor Burke, we've probably spent a good portion of it down on this type of stuff, the type of stuff of parks, public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=210.431s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we also dealt in some of the previously negotiated items from the memorandum of agreement that was etched out between Eversource<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1080.049s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just briefly, on that note, as you remember early on in the process, 13 years ago, that was one of the major concerns that I think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1112.131s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's why we sent that letter out to the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1700.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've spoken with Mr. Vola on a couple occasions about this and spoken to the Building Commissioner, Mr. Moki.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1757.382s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's what has him concerned the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1760.324s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because it's too open-ended, and you folks need redress right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1779.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Here's what it is at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1781.741s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: First of all, I have to share my surprise with J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1786.145s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: White.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1789.043s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You rightly mentioned, they're one of the top construction firms in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1792.625s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They do enormous projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1796.308s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And you would think, given their history and their success, that they ought to know how to treat people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1802.832s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And they're not treating you well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1805.014s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1809.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Moki has examined this and cited<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1817.984s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: the property owner for a zoning violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1820.586s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So a citation has been issued, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1823.887s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He goes through then a process of responding or appealing, and then they go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1831.951s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Hopefully this will be resolved before then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1835.433s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He personally met with the manager or whoever's in charge at that location for the construction company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1844.39s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He explained to them and walked through the whole thing with them where they're in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1849.934s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So they themselves have been put on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1853.497s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He's assured us that the inspectional service director, Mr. Bavuso, is monitoring them on off hours and making spot checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1863.485s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to survey the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1865.166s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He wanted you to be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1867.266s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And then this is going to have to follow its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1871.748s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1882.331s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because he doesn't want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1884.352s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That reflects poorly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1886.372s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1898.3s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1898.58s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1901.542s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Like it's kind of been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1902.843s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1905.866s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The trucks left for the day on their projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1909.268s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1909.969s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So that's where I've been updated on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1913.993s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1924.644s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But that's where he has us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1927.867s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1932.07s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But this is important, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=1934.392s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as Councilors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2350.888s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And then this is going to have to follow its course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2355.37s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I have to say that from what I've been told, the property owner is aware of what's going on clearly now and wants to move to get them out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2365.954s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because he doesn't want them, that reflects poorly, because as you recall, he was a good neighbor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2381.899s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2382.199s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: He probably thought it was going to be a dump spot for trucks and that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2386.46s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And he was kind of turned key when he operated out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2389.481s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The trucks left for the day on their projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2393.582s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So that's where I've been updated on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2397.607s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As far as a council resolution, that's up to the councilors if we want to refer this for action and further communication from the building inspector, but that's where he has us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2411.505s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2415.69s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But this is important, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_Q1KmNS3O8k&t=2418.012s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This work that you put together is important, because I think it helped us as Councilors clarify the scope to which they're behind, and it also is clear that it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=190.873s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I'm delighted to also endorse this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=194.755s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Nothing's too good for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=929.067s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=930.507s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Trick or treat, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=933.208s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, the minutes, the agendas of various boards and commissions are posted on the city website in advance of their meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=947.331s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, the Zoning Board of Appeals has often been presented to me by legal authorities as being a semi-judiciary board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=958.068s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They make a judicious decisions, uh, regarding alleviating, alleviating, uh, encumbrances or, uh, the actual letter of the law regarding our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=971.056s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Uh, they can be on great matters or small matters, expanding your front porch, uh, widening your driveway, uh, things of that nature, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=982.142s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Um, and, and one of the things that protects that board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=985.766s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: is that it's free from political influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=988.91s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's free from the influence of city councilors going in there, the mayor telling them what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=995.196s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's the way it's set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=997.439s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1001.964s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Given the way this was just presented to us by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, I cannot support that because we don't have language to change our ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1011.712s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I'm certainly not going to change our ordinance blindly without having a text before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1019.7s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Secondly, Mr. President, I wouldn't dare touch this without proper legal advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1024.944s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I would think that an officer of the court would know that, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1031.226s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I agree, I wholeheartedly agree that there are some flaws with the way people have access to that meeting room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1038.748s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It certainly isn't to a standard that people would want, but that needs to be addressed too, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1046.291s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But to change the, by ordinance, when an independent board can meet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1054.205s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to make it subject to influence by members of a separate political body, Mr. President, I don't think is good business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1065.434s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1729.294s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=64.344s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=66.586s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Two things I want to mention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=68.147s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: First of all, about the importance of this honor that's bestowed on the citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=74.632s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's not only just to recognize the good works that these people have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=83.133s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's also important because they're held up as examples and as persons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=94.062s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think all of us in the city are inspired by the recipients of this honor in many ways throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=103.088s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one in particular has inspired me, and I'm reminded of that inspiration every time, not only I show up to work in the Minor, but every time I walk into this building to do the business of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=117.658s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's my father, Fred DelRusso, who was honored at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=128.984s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: in many capacities throughout the years, not only professionally, but as a volunteer, and certainly as a service here in City Hall, as a member of our city council, and as mayor of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=141.594s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So, Dad, thank you for your inspiration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=144.416s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: All of you, and to all the people who are mentioned on this plaque, both here with us, those who weren't able to join us, and those who have gone to God, we thank them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=157.647s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: for their inspiration and for how they have given us a challenge to inspire us to live towards greatness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=168.149s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=169.469s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And Madam Mayor, we're gonna invite up now Tina Caruso, President of the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=179.331s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So Dominic Camaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c3JkoYgGg3s&t=185.523s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Who is like the dean of the College of Cardinals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2378.019s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: My name is Fred Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2379.2s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm a candidate for re-election to City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2381.683s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've served on the council for nearly 12 years now, six terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2384.705s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm in the end of my sixth term, up for reelection to a seventh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2388.366s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I am part of a family that's lived in this community for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2391.988s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm the fourth generation of my family to live in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2395.79s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm the third generation of my family to live in the same house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2399.292s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I had to buy the house from my father, but it was the house that he had to buy from his father as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2405.875s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm the third generation of my family to operate a business in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2409.838s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I love this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2410.778s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've had a lot of opportunity in my life to do other things, but this is where I choose to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2416.623s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This is where I choose to serve, to live out my family's heritage of service in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2422.287s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's something that's shaped who I am as a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2425.97s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The only time I lived out of the city was the 12 years I was in religious life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2429.873s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that experience too, both academically and spiritually, shaped who I am as a person as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2436.818s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And finally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2438.597s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: One of the things that shaped me is doing the work of being a city councilor and serving all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2444.521s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's been a good experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2446.623s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's been challenging at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2450.125s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's been disappointing at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2452.587s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But at the end of it all, I'm glad I'm doing it and I want to continue to do it for all of you and for all of us because in that we grow and prosper together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2463.534s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've learned a lot over my years on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2466.176s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one of the greatest issues or lessons I've learned is that we only get things done by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2472.7s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I could rattle off to you a long list of things that I've accomplished in the 12 years that I've served on this council, and I've had a share in virtually all of them that have happened in this city, though there are some that I perhaps can't put my name to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2489.249s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: However, I've learned that nothing gets done here unless we're working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2495.673s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We work together by listening to the community, and I've done that throughout the years, and I continue to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2501.796s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: My opinion has changed on issues because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2505.878s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I was a skeptic with the Green Line, and yet I've come along, and I see its benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2512.841s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I was concerned on how it will affect many of the neighbors, but I've worked hard and long on that with many of you, and I've come along on that, and I see its benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2525.427s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've established good relationships in this community among the greater business community because I'm a businessman, but also because I'm a city councilor, and I see how people who live here, work here, and invest in this community really make it a great place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2540.19s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've established great relationships with the people who work in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2545.311s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's how we get things done, by having solid, good, working relationships with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2551.669s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The people who work in this building are committed to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2555.512s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They are committed to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2557.513s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They don't come here because it's a great building to work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2560.635s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The bathrooms are terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2562.176s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This ceiling was caving in until a couple weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2565.859s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And the roof was leaking until a couple months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2569.101s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2569.861s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's redone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2570.602s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We still got a ways to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2576.687s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I was not afraid to stand alone, to move forward on the bonding of money, to begin the process of the new police station, which has been a long-term goal of mine, which we'll finally see come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2590.599s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I've been honored to work with a group of people, one committee that sort of fizzled out in its momentum, through no fault of anybody, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=2604.315s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This is gonna be the thing that we're on the cusp of moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5696.859s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We can see this demonstrated most clearly with the work that's been done at the intersections of College Avenue and Boston Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5707.845s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I agree with this and second approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6191.341s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=618.537s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=638.813s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We've worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=654.4s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They've been compliant to any of our requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=658.261s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They've certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us, and so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=675.346s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=684.452s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They'll bring something new and diverse to us, something positive and energetic, and so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1141.439s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Those full maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1142.259s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think everybody has their maps with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.013s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.373s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1847.434s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1852.02s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1868.876s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: First, let me say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1871.728s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think this is a good measure, we need it in the square, and Comcast needs to get this work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1878.792s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They're the primary provider here in the city of Medford, and people need this service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1886.616s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm looking at the language in this petition, and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone, and she's doing something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1899.32s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: is going to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets, and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1915.889s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1922.352s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we need to have a motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1925.213s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: an amendment to this paper that the city council understands that the language herein, this petition for this public hearing and to have this work done is saying that the city engineer of the city of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb that Comcast understands that and will fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1954.449s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: the City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1963.836s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Traffic plans, traffic, digging up sales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1971.756s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 10 of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1979.222s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1991.178s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: not engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2004.045s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We had several private contractors over the years advise the cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2008.687s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2017.592s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2020.498s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: from citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2031.363s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2048.688s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Salem Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2054.092s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And let them find another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2055.934s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Let them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2063.379s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2075.429s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Let's let's look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2077.454s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Let's let the engineering department and the community development department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2085.023s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: experiment with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2092.646s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think the citizens of Medford will benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2095.187s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They're going to benefit from getting this work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2097.548s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Hopefully, they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2103.57s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.631s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.991s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: With that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2109.272s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.008s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.988s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2579.514s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If we accept this amendment, we've clarified it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2582.476s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2587.906s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: discussions over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2604.246s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And it seems to me the way I read this language<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2608.15s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: here in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2613.411s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2625.915s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2635.518s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2636.738s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not qualified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2638.1s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not an engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2639.642s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not a construction person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2641.705s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I can't shovel snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2643.408s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm pretty good with leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2645.872s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Every morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2652.647s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's the scope of my construction skills, but the engineer and her staff understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2660.372s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This is their profession, and it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked, and I think we should allow them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2669.758s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2677.663s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think that the construction people need to be aware that National Engineers had some serious problems historically in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2686.929s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2691.613s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2701.921s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2714.788s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2725.936s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion on the table, if you want to present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5261.074s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I wish that caution would be given as to making disparaging remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9515.523s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If I could, just a point of clarification on Councilor Knights, if I may, Mr. President, Chair, to Councilor Knights' summation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9526.289s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Now, I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Weidman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with 6 to 11 in the back of the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9541.657s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And your suggestion was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9545.232s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: remains status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9545.873s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That we have a review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9547.274s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That your suggestion is status quo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9549.737s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That we have a review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9552.3s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9552.94s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9557.245s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that we have, that it's tied only to weapons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9563.752s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Only to weapons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9564.213s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And not to the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9582.032s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And with a 30-day review, we can look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9995.554s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, if I could point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9998.837s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: a special permit solely to the company of weapons, not to the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10004.239s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10005.159s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And, like I said... And the trash, President Langelkorn, without any trash... Maybe the term we should use is no loading or unloading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10850.903s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I said Chairman Marks give a discourse on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12528.191s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12530.272s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I too was very, very impressed with the amount of expertise that they've developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12536.794s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's clear that the work of making headway with the FAA is going to be through contact<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12551.175s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and petition to our federal delegation, to our representatives, to the House of Representatives, and also to our Senators, and through work at their offices, with the cooperation of Mask Watch at the FAA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12569.966s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because it seems to me from their presentations that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12575.668s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's not going to be elimination of this noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12578.73s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's going to have to be a way to find an equitable distribution of who's going to get some of the noise, some of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12592.73s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's what we're going to have to live with, if I understood their presentations correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12600.293s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But our efforts have to be focused, as you mentioned, on the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12883.46s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12883.841s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: What a wonderful measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12884.881s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I was pleased, I forget what venue it was in, but recently at some point this summertime, I believe I heard the mayor announce that she was pursuing this, this exploration and was working on it as an effort for traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13204.431s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14534.285s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just one suggestion, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14559.999s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This way we can get an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2814.688s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We've worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2830.256s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They've been compliant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2832.297s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to any of our requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2834.139s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They've certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2843.667s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2851.225s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: As a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2860.31s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They'll bring something new and diverse to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2863.412s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's something positive and energetic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2865.914s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4021.971s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4022.331s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4023.352s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4027.975s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: A couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4044.826s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: First, let me say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4047.675s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think this is a good measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4048.975s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We need it in the square and Comcast needs to get this work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4054.696s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They're the primary provider here in the city of Medford and people need this service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4062.578s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm looking at the language in this petition and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone and she's doing something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4075.752s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4091.844s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4098.288s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we need to have a motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4100.83s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: an amendment to this paper that the City Council understands that the language herein, this petition, for this public hearing and to have this work done, is saying that the City Engineer of the City of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb, that Comcast understands that and will fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4130.43s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: the City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4139.817s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Traffic plans, traffic, digging up sales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4147.72s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 10 of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4155.167s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4167.142s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: not engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4180.013s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We had several private contractors over the years advise the cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4184.637s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4193.524s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4196.408s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: from citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4207.273s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4224.622s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Salem Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4230.023s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And let them find another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4231.863s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Let them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4239.305s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4251.367s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Let's look at this, let the engineering department and the community development department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4260.953s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: experiment with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4268.579s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think the citizens of Medford will benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4271.12s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: They're going to benefit from getting this work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4273.482s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Hopefully, they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4279.566s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4283.629s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4283.99s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: With that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4285.29s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.006s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.806s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4755.512s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If we accept this amendment, we've clarified it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4758.493s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4763.9s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: discussions over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4780.254s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And it seems to me the way I read this language<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4784.164s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: here in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4789.427s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4801.933s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4811.537s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4812.758s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not qualified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4814.12s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not an engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4815.641s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm not a construction person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4817.723s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I can shovel snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4819.405s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'm pretty good with leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4821.868s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Every morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4828.662s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's the scope of my construction skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4831.324s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But the engineer and her staff understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4836.368s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This is their profession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4838.449s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4843.333s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think we should allow them, I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4852.9s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think that the construction people need to be aware that National's Ridge had some serious problems historically in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4862.909s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4867.613s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4878.161s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: approval, and certainly day-to-day will mandate how the traffic needs to be dealt with, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4886.903s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So with the amendment that I've proposed, as I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4901.927s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5794.602s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Chief, thank you for your leadership of the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5797.883s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You're a man who gets things done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5799.643s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5801.403s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7098.54s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7433.819s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7434.26s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Point of order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7435.701s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Point of order, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7437.383s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I wish that caution would be given as to making disparaging remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11692.047s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Could just a point of clarifications on Councilor Knights, if I may, Mr. President and Chair, to Councilor Knights' summation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11702.61s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Now, I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Westman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with six to 11 in the back of the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11716.273s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And your suggestion was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11722.237s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That we have a review, that your suggestion is status quo, that we have a review, yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11729.941s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: At what point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11731.482s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11732.562s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11733.723s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that we have, that it's tied only to weapons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11740.466s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And not to the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11743.692s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Do I have those three points?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11758.303s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And the 30-day review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12171.851s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, if I can point out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12174.333s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: holding this special permit solely to the company of wetlands, not to the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12180.538s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12181.458s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And, like I said... And the trash, President Lago-Kern, regarding the trash... Maybe the term we should use is no loading or unloading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=13007.696s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Motion for suspension of the rules to take committee report of the side committee, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=13027.361s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I ask that Chairman Marks give a discourse on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14706.672s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I too was very, very impressed with the amount of expertise that they've developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14713.216s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's clear that the work of making headway with the FAA is going to be through contact<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14727.577s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and petition to our federal delegation, to our representatives, to the House of Representatives, and also to our Senators, and through work in their offices, with the cooperation of Mass Watch at the FAA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14746.392s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Because it seems to me from their presentations that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14752.077s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's not going to be elimination of this noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14755.14s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's going to have to be a way to find an equitable distribution of who's going to get some of the noise, some of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14770.074s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's what we're going to have to live with, if I understood their presentations correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=14776.701s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But our efforts have to be focused, as you mentioned, on the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=15059.88s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=15060.261s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: What a wonderful measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=15061.301s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I was pleased, I forget what venue it was in, but recently at some point this summertime, I believe I heard the mayor announce that she was pursuing this, this exploration and was working on it as an effort for traffic calming measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=15380.955s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16710.836s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just one suggestion, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16736.482s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This way we can get an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16738.994s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: rather than be swallowed up by endless speculation and debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=977.273s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The businesses on Boston Avenue with relation to construction tied into the Green Line and some related developments that are going to capitalize off of the Green Line have suffered tremendously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=991.96s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: On Winchester Street, on the other end from where you're digging, down towards Harvard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=998.244s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: residents were disrupted for two years with work that was done to accommodate the widening of the Harvard Street Bridge and dealing with a lot of the issues there, some of which were promised to be addressed and never were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1016.218s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I speak of drainage issues in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1036.528s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: What I'm saying is that the people who I represent are going to now be faced with another in a series of disruptive construction projects that's going to challenge their egress in and off of their properties, is going to tie up traffic in a cut-through street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1055.833s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: that gets people between Harvard Street and Broadway and avoids using the ridiculous powerhouse circle, which has traffic patterns and timing there that is contrary to reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2232.684s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2239.687s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'd certainly invite it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2242.389s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2248.172s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2261.078s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: 12 years, 14 years, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2265.02s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2271.022s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: People want to see it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2274.283s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2280.426s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2284.129s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station, the rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2309.084s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2317.947s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So, that being said, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2323.583s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I'd like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2334.546s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication and a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2345.628s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2355.591s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't see need to table this tonight nor do I see a need to withhold it and hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2364.117s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I would like to move on it decisively tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=7850.737s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I would think that procedurally the best thing to do would be to send this to the Committee on Ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=707.294s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: several years ago had suggested an ordinance to deal with graffiti, and I think it got tied down in committee, and one of the sticking points to it, if my memory serves me right, was that this would sometimes, in dealing with the graffiti, one of the things that you've addressed in this is that it can often place the victims of graffiti, the property owner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=734.798s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: also has the additional burden of finding a way to deal with this, get the graffiti cleaned up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=741.903s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And for some people, whether they might own a home or a place of business, the cleanup of such an act is also a burden and may not be covered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4616.959s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: There's a little dog park that's not much bigger than the area behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4623.977s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Simple, clean, place for people to gather, let the dogs run around, play, intermingle, do whatever it is that they do, and you go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4633.885s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's a very simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4635.266s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's not elaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4636.948s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It doesn't have Carrara marble colonnades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4648.177s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4649.078s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And a couple benches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4650.379s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And what's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4655.598s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6011.274s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: helpful rather than speculating to invite them down before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6014.637s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if we should call it a public hearing, but have them appear before the council for the purpose of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6021.543s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You know, this should be done regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6024.166s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Uh, excuse me for going over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6026.187s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: This should be done regularly with any number of issues within this community to refresh people's memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6952.003s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Knight's recommendation is the wise one and the wise course we should follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6958.087s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: In subcommittee then that gives us the opportunity to be a little more conversational with the members of the board to get questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6965.231s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We can convene in council, have further deliberations among us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6971.437s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: and then if we need to call them back, to ask them to come back to address further concerns, and take it from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6979.199s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's an exceptionally wise course, and I think Councilor Penta's bringing this to our attention is important for us to have this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8273.972s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just an interesting statistic, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8276.534s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: According to the official directory of 1950 for the Massachusetts Police Association, Medford at that time had a chief, two captains, five lieutenants, 10 sergeants, and 93 patrolmen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8292.325s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=77.672s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I agree with that 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=82.341s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: uh, chiming in here is because Medford street was mentioned, uh, which seems to be more of a gravel path these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=90.924s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'm wondering if, uh, if the council wouldn't mind me amending this to include that the DPW commissioner, uh, uh, examine ways that we can perhaps resurface Medford street on the motion of council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=158.281s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It's completely germane to the Green Line project and would greatly enhance quality of life visitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=165.767s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Even if you look at the quality of some of the sidewalks in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=172.121s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't like to be critical, but I mean, a lot of them are just lacking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=176.503s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And it needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=178.865s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We also, I'm sure we all received the same email this weekend that I know a group of neighbors up there had done really tremendous work in addressing some sanitation and rodent issues up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=194.573s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we've seen additional infractions happening on the other side of the border.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=201.681s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: you know, this is an area that a neighborhood that needs attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=206.905s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I know a lot of the side streets up there have gotten some over the past couple of years as far as resurfacing, resurfacing, new pipes, sidewalks, and I'd love to see that continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=318.946s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=319.767s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So there's some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=323.431s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I didn't mean to interrupt either one of you, but, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=326.502s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I do have to point out that even though, and I agree the crosswalks are faded and in need of attention, but you know, throughout the summer season, the staff at the Tufts pool does a wonderful job at putting up barriers and cones and really bringing attention and focus on the pedestrian traffic in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=348.554s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So this can only help their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1124.229s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I just want to commend Councilor Caraviello in suggesting that a committee be appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1129.473s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's a wonderful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1130.213s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: You know, I spoke tonight up at the pool when we were examining that and the need to encourage opportunities when the pool is restored for people to participate in that as far as exercising leadership in the maintenance and operation of the pool facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1149.056s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And again, because those oftentimes bring out the best in people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1154.463s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And having enthusiasts for dogs and pets to participate in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1162.142s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: uh, establishing this, uh, new facility in the city, uh, for, for the dogs and, and for them to have their exercise and ability to, uh, uh, perhaps live, uh, in a more unrestrained way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1175.046s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think it's wonderful opportunity for people to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1177.527s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1179.608s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And, uh, I lend my support to this, uh, uh, motion, Mr. President on the motion as amended when a roll call vote on the roll, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1750.091s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Just a point of information, Mr. President, and maybe Councilor Penta could refresh my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1756.735s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: When was the Judge Jackson report issued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1767.26s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3501.579s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: That's a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3502.78s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3504.161s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3505.602s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: still the contracted auditor for the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3511.725s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4580.531s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Vice president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4581.792s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Thank you, uh, Mr. President and council along the current, uh, uh, presents a, uh, a very worthwhile resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4589.518s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We, uh, maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4592.281s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I don't know if it was Mrs. Burke or in Baker, our auditor, prepared annually for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4602.567s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think maybe Stephanie always used to ask for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4606.43s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It was a sheet that showed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4609.258s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: all the bond indebtedness that we had, but it rolled out 30 years, and it showed us when something was going to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4617.972s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It was a very helpful tool for us to examine everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4624.594s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It had big items on there that we're still paying off, some of the schools and all that type of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4629.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And then some smaller, bigger items, like every time we have to drop several hundred thousand dollars on a new fire truck, things that we'd bond maybe for a shorter term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4640.51s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So, I think it would be very helpful in us looking at that, and I agree with Councilor Penter in the sense that we need to be updated on where we are with the city yard, what's going on with that, and most especially with the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4657.916s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: The last meeting we had on that several months ago, it was still called out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4663.839s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And we're waiting for an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4666.567s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I know sometimes getting engineer studies and soil samples and all that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4671.497s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: It takes time to compile and pull together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4674.578s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But, you know, the scenario, tentative scenario that was laid out for us for the police station wasn't something that was pleasing to me, I must say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4684.621s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I'd really like to see where we are with that before we get too far in something that maybe more than one of us will find disagreeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4698.024s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right in asking for this update as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4706.188s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: We do have aspects of the pool that are time sensitive, and I know access issues are very important to an awful lot of us, but that doesn't mean we can't proceed while examining, straightening that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4724.304s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So I'm grateful for all of that, and I hope that we can make progress on this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5264.578s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: If I could, through the chair, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5267.239s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Rosen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5270.894s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So you pointed out a way of presenting budget and analyzing how each department finishes out each year, how it spent its money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5285.542s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And oftentimes when we get to the end of the year, we do so without doing so in that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5295.424s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Department X has $30,000 left over that it didn't spend, and it's the last week in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5302.827s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So we're going to take that money and throw it into Department Y, who overspent $60,000, and hope let's try to find the other 30 somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5316.792s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Vis-a-vis the whole capital improvement program, which I think is built into our budget as far as our indebtedness,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.01s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: throughout the S.Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5325.75s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: debt service each year is budgeted, because we know that's going to be what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5332.912s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: How do you think we can then better improve the budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5464.031s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: So starting out with the budget, because I sit on a board for the non-profit, and when we go through our annual budget, we do a projection that we know we're going to have this to work with, X. And then we build to that goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5480.843s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And part of that goal in the non-profit is an aspect of fundraising for operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5485.426s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But nonetheless, we meet that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5489.614s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think I've often thought that that might be a more helpful way of doing what we do here, though it's tough because there's so much unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5500.518s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: However, I think that sort of a, and we had talked about this as a group, and I'm sure you remember as far as when we've, several years ago, when we got up to the point of this capital improvement program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5519.216s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: that as a council we had envisioned a visioning process that would be collaborative and something that would have open communication, clarity in goals that we then come to agreement on and reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5541.587s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I think to a degree, we did that without going through that process, because the way government communicates in Medford isn't what one may describe as healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5557.539s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: But we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5558.96s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: And I think what you're trying to say, or what you are saying, is, well, then let's do that in a healthy, transparent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5569.87s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: involves participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8225.599s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: Mr. President, this gentleman, whose resume we've seen in the past, is a great citizen, a great patriot, and a great financier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8238.801s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: I second the approval offered by Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8273.328s">[Fred Dello Russo]</a>: By point of information, remind the Councilors that we have in the past been in receipt of his resume.<br><br>
