    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=311.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'll have a question, but I'm going to wait until the dialogue starts a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=314.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I do have some questions, but I'd like to just let things roll, if you don't mind, first, before I start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=320.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=332.442s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You mean raise hands through the participants, Paul, or through physically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=505.122s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You say yes to me, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=509.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=510.645s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So yeah, to Mr. DeLava's point, I guess that raises a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=515.228s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What if you have two students, for example, that do get in a fight, and we did do indoor suspension, or there was an indoor suspension?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=524.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How would that address, I guess, or we would need to address those students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=529.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would imagine not being together in an indoor, you know, I don't even know if you're going to call it suspension, but, um, or maybe they would be in a restorative justice circle or, I don't know, I guess I'm just curious, how would you respond, um, to that as an example?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=571.218s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=571.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So then I guess, thank you, Mr. Downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=573.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I didn't know who was speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=575.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So also it might be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=576.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was looking for you on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=577.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=578.224s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just, I'm double screening cause I'm taking my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=581.246s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=582.147s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So maybe we can just ask folks to, um, you know, before they speak, just maybe say their name and what their role is would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=588.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I'm going to try to do my best with taking these minutes to Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=591.614s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, so maybe some elaboration on if it's not a suspension,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=596.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: we're not doing, you know, if we're considering not having suspension for obvious reasons with disproportionality, what might consequences, if that's the right word, logical consequences or otherwise look like instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=789.386s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=792.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you do me a favor and actually share, or I think it would be helpful to maybe read the resolution one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=799.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wish I had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=800.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was trying to, when you were talking, I was typing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=802.557s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not going to do that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=803.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But maybe the last part of the resolution so I can, it would just help me as we're talking, just if you wouldn't mind, just one more time, just the last part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=814.136s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had all the whereas, whereas, whereas, but the summary of the, or the outcome that you're looking for, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=945.578s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excuse me one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=946.419s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=947.739s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you stop sharing the screen now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=949.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I can't take notes when you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=950.761s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1307.685s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, would you guys mind sharing that screen for one second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1389.361s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think I saw Mr. Blough, yeah, I think I saw Mr. Blough cut his hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1393.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I don't know, Paul, if you wanna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1395.585s">[McLaughlin]</a>: calling him, but I also have another follow-up to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1397.706s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Jenny, thank you for sharing the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1398.966s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Don't take it away yet, please, because I want to comment on something there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1404.207s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you want to go first, Mr. Blauck, or do you want me to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1810.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1811.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to that end, to Paul's point, I also want to point out the data here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1818.672s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that 84% of 112, so about 80% of these discipline suspensions are students, high-need students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1835.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1839.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is, again, another data point that's really important to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1844.226s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So looking at the 62%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1846.813s">[McLaughlin]</a>: persons of color and more than 80% or 80% high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1851.536s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so what is the intersectionality around addressing the social emotional component of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1857.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that Stacey Shulman has her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1859.922s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'll be curious to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1861.083s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But as we're addressing trauma, as we're addressing social emotional needs of children, and again, getting back to some of that implicit bias around that, what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1870.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And, you know, a student who is experiencing a lot of aggression at home and then comes into school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1876.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, maybe has a teacher or someone that is, seems threatening or aggressive to them and they explode, you know, we understand that that can be a root cause of trauma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1887.965s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, but the data does speak volumes in that 80% of our students that are getting disciplined are high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1895.791s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I would love for folks to talk about that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1908.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: 84 out of 112?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1923.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Except it's not because it's 11.5 plus 15 plus 11.5 for the high need, well it depends on the students with disabilities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1932.992s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and the economically disadvantaged are also in the high needs 11.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1948.143s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the 15.8 and the 12.3 are the equivalent of the 11.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1950.805s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's the way I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1958.251s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, then how can it, if it's students disciplined and 84 of them are high needs and the total students disciplined are 112, that's not 11%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1990.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1992.329s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I was saying approximately 80, looking at 84 to the 112.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1995.952s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1996.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it's actually 75% because Jenny, you know, used her calculator or her brain and did the math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2000.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2001.295s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Calculator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2002.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was like, I assume calculator, but I didn't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2005.758s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2007.019s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's a really, that's an important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2009.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: 75% of them are high needs of the students who are being disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2016.704s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, it goes to the same point that member Rousseau is saying, you know, are we saying that students who have high needs are, you know, require discipline more than students who don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2026.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Maybe, and maybe again, you know, Stacey Shulman can speak to that, but maybe suspension isn't the way to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2033.853s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm done now, but I wanted to just point out that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2036.814s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I am going to ask if everyone's okay, Paul, that you stop sharing the screen just so I can go back to my Word document to take notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2042.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2784.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2784.918s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was listening and I just sort of wanted to ask folks or have folks think about a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2792.792s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One is, I don't think that this is suggesting that we're taking away discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2796.88s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2797.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: suggesting that we're taking a closer look at what the disciplinary measures that have been being used are, how effective they've been, and whether or not color has played or race has played a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2809.501s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think the data shows, I don't think, I know the data shows us that race clearly has played a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2815.445s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we were just listening to a student speaking the other day talking about wearing headphones in the hallway at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2824.822s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And she, and this wasn't recent, so I don't want anybody to think that this was them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2830.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: but she talked about walking in the hallway and she's a black woman student and being yelled at and disciplined for having her headphones on in the hallway as a white student was walking by her doing the exact same thing and did not get yelled at, did not get disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2847.023s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is part of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2848.364s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is where the implicit bias comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2850.265s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that people don't realize that we don't realize that we are built with this implicit bias because we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2857.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: part of a system that we were brought up in and have been part of our entire lives where we see things as threats related to color, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2867.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we see them as more threatening when they're related to color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2869.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's why we see disproportionality and discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2871.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, disproportionality and discipline is a national issue in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2876.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not something that's specific to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2878.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a national issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2879.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: People of color are disproportionately disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2884.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in our schools and that, I think, is what Member Rousseau is trying to address in this subcommittee and in this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2890.174s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's what I would like us to really take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2892.775s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the discussion that we're not hearing right now, I feel like, is, you know, I appreciated what Stacey Shulman was saying as well about, you know, going back and looking at the events and what sort of triggers the suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2904.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that's important, too, to look at the backstories and the data and the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2907.901s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But the fact still remains that we are still disproportionately disciplining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2912.822s">[McLaughlin]</a>: students of color and that is regardless of the instances or the you know what happened or whatever that is a direct result of our own bias and you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2924.016s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can share sort of one of my own stories, you know, as a mother of a white male student who, you know, in high school, I mean, in middle school, certainly was disciplined, but might have got a phone call home first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2939.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, as the co-chair of the CPAC and someone who's involved in the schools and someone who has maybe some means and has a relationship with the administration and all those other things, got phone calls home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2949.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, from them to address any sort of discipline issues and also, you know, a student on a, on an ed plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2956.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, so the disability certainly was a factor in this role, but also in this situation, but also got the benefit of a phone call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2963.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, when another parent may not have gotten that, um, maybe because they didn't have a relationship or maybe because they weren't white, or maybe because we don't realize that we do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2972.184s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They're not intentional, but they, we do do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2975.205s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so we have to pay attention to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2977.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that's really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2979.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: an important piece, and as much as I wish color wasn't a part of this, it clearly is because the data shows us that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2986.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4538.168s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4539.089s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, member Graham, can you send me those two additions in the chat just for the notes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4542.911s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, I got the first one, but not the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4545.893s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then, um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4548.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then, um, you know, I also just am hoping people recognize the fact that the rules policy and equity subcommittee is a new subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4558.34s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We had not had an equity subcommittee before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4561.902s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, we've certainly had rules, um, subcommittee and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4566.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and policy, but equity is a different lens that we're really putting to the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4572.061s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it's a really important perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4574.123s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so when we're talking about reporting out, who are we reporting out to, you know, on an annual basis of that, you know, if that's sort of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4583.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The point is that, you know, I would say to the equity subcommittee specifically, um, to sort of look at this, but also within the administration, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4591.745s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I also believe I don't have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4595.446s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I don't know, I believe I saw Joan on the call, uh, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4598.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen, but the coordinated program review, which happens every three years, um, and it's happening this year for the district and includes our high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4607.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Uh, uh, some of our high needs population, our English learners and our, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4612.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: students with disabilities has an element of discipline in the CPR program review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4618.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's an important piece to also look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4620.945s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that will be coming starting this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4624.326s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think they report out in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4627.087s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that might be an interesting opportunity for a look at data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4630.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But Joan, if you're still here, can you address the section on CPR around discipline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4701.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4703.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And is it also an opportunity in that I know that they speak directly with CPAC, but there's also opportunities for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4710.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: families to reach out to DESE as part of their, they're not calling it a Coordinated Program Review anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4716.429s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, no, they just want to- No, they changed it, so it's just peer-focused monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4719.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Peer-focused monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4721.652s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4722.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So TFM now, not CPR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4725.374s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4727.655s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I find it to be a very valuable source of data for folks that are on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4734.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can look at the last one, which was three years ago, right, Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4739.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can look at the last one that was three years ago to really get a sense of what the data is in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4743.575s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's very, very interesting data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4746.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And additionally, as DESE is doing the tiered focused monitoring research, community members and administrators and, you know, staff and school committee members and whoever can reach out to them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4762.301s">[McLaughlin]</a>: give them information or ask them questions or ask them to include information in the report and review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4768.102s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4768.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that they definitely reach out to the CPAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4772.803s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think they have some other requirements about who else they reach out to specifically in the community, but anybody can reach out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4779.024s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that's a really important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4781.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5734.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5735.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Russo, I just wanted to mention, I'm not sure, I think you responded earlier, but wanted to make sure you didn't forget the comment in the chat regarding a suspension example during remote learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5750.448s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6152.893s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I make a motion to approve the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6156.375s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6162.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6164.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6166.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6167.74s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6169.546s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I will call myself Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6171.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6172.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6215.658s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would second both sentiments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6217.419s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Congratulations, everyone, for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6219.559s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're thinking of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6220.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6221.84s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And see you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6230.262s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6233.563s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6234.784s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1299.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for the rapport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1300.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was really good seeing everyone at curriculum night the other night and the great turnout and the increased attendance and interest in our vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1308.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know that you guys have all done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1310.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: or collectively, it looks great over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1311.826s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hope people are taking a tour around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1314.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just excited by the opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1316.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1318.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2002.815s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2005.057s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2006.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's definitely an ambitious schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2007.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It looks like you guys are going to be really busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2009.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did have a couple of questions about how the PCAT review team will be selected, how we'll be addressing diversity and equity for the selection of the team, and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2024.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Specifically, I don't see a family representative on there, and I just wanted to make that recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2028.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I also would make a recommendation for a special education representative and a EL representative, especially as we're thinking about how items translate, how words have varying meanings among different cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2043.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would especially think about if we could differentiate instruction and universal design for learning for students with disabilities, as you can imagine, especially around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2053.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sex education, puberty, that sort of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2056.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I certainly have resources that I can share with you around some other curriculums that we've experienced that have been great, but definitely want us to be proactive as we're thinking about how we're differentiating that information for all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2069.195s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.078s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2315.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just what's the time commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2317.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know it said it's two times a month that you guys plan on meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2320.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How long are those meetings going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2363.268s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And just lastly, I'm wondering if there's any sort of pediatrician or any role like that that you guys have considered for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2846.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2848.03s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2854.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, now I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2855.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They unmuted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2856.734s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3828.757s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excellent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4297.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6718.715s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7395.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7396.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry I'm remote, but I wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7399.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for folks who are coming forward to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7401.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think this is a really important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7403.599s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was, we actually had suspension and discipline on the agenda at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7409.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that was deferred to have school committee members come back with some notifications about what they wanted to ask about suspension and discipline particular to reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7418.906s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we had had that on the last agenda and that hadn't happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7421.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to mention that because that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7424.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was one of the discussions that we had that we were gonna have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7429.711s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7430.191s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um and then, you know this incident happened, and everybody obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7439.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Was in a tailspin dealing with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7441.113s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also just wanted some clarification if I could on the on the section that says be it also resolved that the project scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7448.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Will include recommendations to address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7456.296s">[McLaughlin]</a>: past handling of incidents that are race, gender, or bullying biased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7461.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just specifically around that, I wanted to make an amendment that included disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7466.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So race, disability, gender, or bullying bias is the request I'm making for an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7501.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The MIC is not on sorry man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7736.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7739.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, I'm not sure if you can see my hand because it's on Facebook, sorry, or on Zoom, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7745.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to be clear that Dr. Edward Vincent is our superintendent, and we are all part of the team, and it's all of our children, and we are all mothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7758.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when we talk about our schools, the community is part of our schools, our teachers are part of our schools, the school committee is part of our schools, our superintendent, the central administration team, all of us are part of our schools, and we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7773.372s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As Miss Brantley was saying earlier, what can we do to help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7775.654s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all need to work together to be able to improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7779.537s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to, I think it's unfair, frankly, to put blame on one person for anything that happens within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7786.462s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a collective community environment for all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7790.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What happened is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7792.126s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we're all heartsick over it and we all want to improve our school and we're all here for the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7797.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just wanna just make that point because we're a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7800.62s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know Dr. Edward Vincent has been with our team for a few years now and it's not easy turning around a district after 25 to 27 years of somebody else being the lead in the district and a whole different administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7816.847s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just had to say that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7980.629s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, with the amendment, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8019.406s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8028.093s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8164.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10003.12s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10006.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10007.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10008.303s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Galluzzi for talking about the importance of the improvement rating so that it's not just about what the scores are, but that it's really about seeing students improving over time as well, because that's a really important piece of data that we're seeing the improvement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10026.596s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you for sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10035.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10036.812s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We can continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10147.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10157.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9727.627s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9729.163s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9730.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9732.085s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9733.005s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm also a parent of three, two Medford high school graduates, one current Medford public school student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9739.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I've lived in Medford for 23 years and I'm here tonight specifically because I want to support the superintendent in her role and because I want to support the school committee and the parents and families and students in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9753.036s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're all heartbroken about what has happened to our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9757.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: over the past few months, but it has not been just the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9760.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there are plenty of people in the community that know that and that understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9764.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It has been years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9765.475s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had a bullying problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9766.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Most high schools have bullying problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9768.336s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's a rise in violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9770.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's national.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9771.158s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can see it all over the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9772.939s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is happening particularly because of pandemic, but also because of the politicized nature of the hatred that exists in communities between polarized sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9783.003s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And our children are often mimicking what they're seeing their adults do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9786.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And what I think is really important is what we've heard from city council members who are talking about finding solutions to work together, to collaborate, to change systems for all of our children, not some of our children, all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9798.173s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This has been ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9799.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're talking about not just the past four years of this administration, meaning this particular superintendent, this has been an ongoing problem from when other people were on school committee, from when people have been around for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9809.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanna clarify for the community and for city councilors, I'm not afraid of being yelled at,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9816.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9817.571s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's inappropriate and unprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9820.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when we talk about bullying in our community, I have never seen more of an example of bullying in our community than I see in the city council chambers every single week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9829.996s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that everybody in the community would agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9842.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we both know each other well, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9844.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're all neighbors here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9844.951s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all know each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9847.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Our children play together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9859.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the ongoing bullying is inappropriate and is what our children are seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9862.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's what I would like to specifically point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9865.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We wanna figure out how to work, should collaborate together to change outcomes for all children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9870.964s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm not gonna be shamed, I'm not gonna be blamed and I'm not gonna be named and neither should any of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9876.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would ask that our city council members across the board and that our community across the board stand up to bullies everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9883.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we make sure that this stops in our community and in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9887.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm here to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9888.151s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm here to roll up my sleeves and help make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9890.692s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we all should be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10071.642s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a huge challenge, especially for bullying, especially for videos being distributed, for videos being given to the news media, for information being shared, for people politicizing situation is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10082.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the children are the social media piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10085.532s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The bullying element on social media is compounded exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10090.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So when we talk about resources that we need, we need resources to help support our children's mental health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10095.339s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is a mental health crisis right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10097.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: because of what people are dealing with on the daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10205.413s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can I, may I please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10207.933s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10209.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10210.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is the barraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10211.794s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is the sort of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10212.779s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, back and forth with people trying to intimidate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10215.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10242.95s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, for one moment, if you don't mind, Superintendent, is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10249.173s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not answering your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10250.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I, through the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10253.115s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10254.316s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just wanted to say that to Councilor Sang and Councilor Collins remarks earlier about people who are intimidated to come up to this podium and who are not able to speak for a number of reasons publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10269.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to please feel free to reach out for solution oriented options, because we are willing and open to listen to community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10274.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a community problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10276.033s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is not seven people that are gonna solve a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10277.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not one person that's gonna solve a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10279.896s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a community systemic problem, and it's a national problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10283.579s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we need all hands working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10285.4s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We don't need people yelling at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10286.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We need people collaborating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=390.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1795.202s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Jenny, I'll help out any way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1797.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have experience with the Science Lab project, with the Boiler Room MSBA projects, and obviously with Fiona.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1804.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if I can help you out, I'll help you out any way I can.<br><br>
