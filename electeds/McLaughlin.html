    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1299.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for the rapport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1300.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was really good seeing everyone at curriculum night the other night and the great turnout and the increased attendance and interest in our vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1308.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know that you guys have all done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1310.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: or collectively, it looks great over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1311.826s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hope people are taking a tour around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1314.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just excited by the opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1316.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1318.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2002.815s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2005.057s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2006.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's definitely an ambitious schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2007.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It looks like you guys are going to be really busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2009.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did have a couple of questions about how the PCAT review team will be selected, how we'll be addressing diversity and equity for the selection of the team, and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2024.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Specifically, I don't see a family representative on there, and I just wanted to make that recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2028.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I also would make a recommendation for a special education representative and a EL representative, especially as we're thinking about how items translate, how words have varying meanings among different cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2043.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would especially think about if we could differentiate instruction and universal design for learning for students with disabilities, as you can imagine, especially around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2053.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sex education, puberty, that sort of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2056.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I certainly have resources that I can share with you around some other curriculums that we've experienced that have been great, but definitely want us to be proactive as we're thinking about how we're differentiating that information for all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2069.195s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.078s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2315.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just what's the time commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2317.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know it said it's two times a month that you guys plan on meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2320.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How long are those meetings going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2363.268s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And just lastly, I'm wondering if there's any sort of pediatrician or any role like that that you guys have considered for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2846.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2848.03s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2854.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, now I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2855.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They unmuted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2856.734s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3828.757s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excellent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4297.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6718.715s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7395.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7396.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry I'm remote, but I wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7399.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for folks who are coming forward to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7401.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think this is a really important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7403.599s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was, we actually had suspension and discipline on the agenda at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7409.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that was deferred to have school committee members come back with some notifications about what they wanted to ask about suspension and discipline particular to reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7418.906s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we had had that on the last agenda and that hadn't happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7421.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to mention that because that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7424.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was one of the discussions that we had that we were gonna have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7429.711s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7430.191s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um and then, you know this incident happened, and everybody obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7439.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Was in a tailspin dealing with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7441.113s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also just wanted some clarification if I could on the on the section that says be it also resolved that the project scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7448.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Will include recommendations to address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7456.296s">[McLaughlin]</a>: past handling of incidents that are race, gender, or bullying biased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7461.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just specifically around that, I wanted to make an amendment that included disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7466.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So race, disability, gender, or bullying bias is the request I'm making for an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7501.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The MIC is not on sorry man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7736.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7739.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, I'm not sure if you can see my hand because it's on Facebook, sorry, or on Zoom, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7745.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to be clear that Dr. Edward Vincent is our superintendent, and we are all part of the team, and it's all of our children, and we are all mothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7758.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when we talk about our schools, the community is part of our schools, our teachers are part of our schools, the school committee is part of our schools, our superintendent, the central administration team, all of us are part of our schools, and we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7773.372s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As Miss Brantley was saying earlier, what can we do to help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7775.654s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all need to work together to be able to improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7779.537s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to, I think it's unfair, frankly, to put blame on one person for anything that happens within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7786.462s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a collective community environment for all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7790.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What happened is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7792.126s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we're all heartsick over it and we all want to improve our school and we're all here for the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7797.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just wanna just make that point because we're a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7800.62s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know Dr. Edward Vincent has been with our team for a few years now and it's not easy turning around a district after 25 to 27 years of somebody else being the lead in the district and a whole different administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7816.847s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just had to say that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7980.629s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, with the amendment, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8019.406s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8028.093s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8164.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10003.12s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10006.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10007.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10008.303s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Galluzzi for talking about the importance of the improvement rating so that it's not just about what the scores are, but that it's really about seeing students improving over time as well, because that's a really important piece of data that we're seeing the improvement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10026.596s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you for sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10035.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10036.812s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We can continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10147.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10157.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=390.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1795.202s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Jenny, I'll help out any way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1797.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have experience with the Science Lab project, with the Boiler Room MSBA projects, and obviously with Fiona.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1804.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if I can help you out, I'll help you out any way I can.<br><br>
